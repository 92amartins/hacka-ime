We synthesized a novel global dataset of forest CO2-fluxes to evaluate the consistency between EC and biometric or chamber methods for quantifying the CO2 budget in forest ecosystems. The EC approach, compared with the other two methods, overestimated net ecosystem production (NEP) by 25% (0.52 Mg C ha−1 yr−1), and underestimated ecosystem respiration (Re) by 10% (1.39 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) and gross primary production by 3% (0.48 Mg C ha−1 yr−1). The differences between EC and the other methods were greater at the sites with complex topography and dense canopy than at the sites with flat topography and open canopy. Forest age also influenced the differences mainly through changes in leaf area index. Open-path EC system induced large positive bias in the NEP estimated by EC, presumably due to its surface-heating effect. These results suggest that EC method likely produce biased estimates of NEP and Re in forest ecosystems. A global extrapolation suggests that the differences in the forest CO2-fluxes measured with different methods be consistent with the global overestimation of NEP and underestimation of Re by EC method. Accounting for these differences would substantially improve our estimates of the forest carbon budget. The uncertainties involved in each method were also discussed. To reduce uncertainty in quantifying both local and global carbon budgets, we recommend cross-validation of forest CO2-fluxes measured by different methods with more accurate measurements and careful data processing strategies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biometry; Chamber; Ecosystem respiration; Eddy covariance; Gross primary production; Net ecosystem production",

In this study, we use a sample of 132 embryos/fetuses of wild lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), obtained over a period of 15 years through collaborative methods with local hunters in the Amazon to describe the intrauterine development of external and internal morphology of this Neotropical rodent. We also compare the newborn survival strategy in this species with other rodents. The crown-rump length (CRL) ranged between 0.6 and 24.6 cm. External features appeared in the following chronological order: limbs, eyelid buds, fusioned eyelids, genitalia, outer ear, tactile pelage, claws, skin, skin spots, covering pelage, teeth and open eyelids. Fetuses with CRL >19.5 cm presented all external features fully developed. The growth formula of fetal age was calculated as ∛W = 0.082 (t - 37.25), and age was accurately associated with CRL. We described the relationship between CRL and external and internal biometry. The liver declined in proportion within the internal cavity, while the relative volume of tubular gastrointestinal organs increased significantly along the embryo/fetal development. All organs, except the heart and the thymus, had similar relative volumes in advanced fetuses and adults. Our comparison of the intrauterine development in several rodent species indicates that the paca's reproductive strategy is comparable to species that are subject to low natural predation. Given that C. paca is perhaps the most hunted animal in Latin America, sustainable hunting throughout its range must take into account its relative reproductive performance. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Amazon; Fetal development; Mammals; Reproduction; Rodentia; Survival",

The study was performed during more than one year on 18 clinically healthy male wild boars with initial and final body weight, of 39 ± 4 kg and 59 ± 3 kg, respectively. The animals were divided into two experimental groups (group I and group II) and one control group (group C) comprising 6 boars per group. Group I animals were administered per os pure zearalenone (ZEN) at 150 μg/kg BW for 7 consecutive days every two months, while group II animals received a dose of 50 μg/kg BW/day via feed that was naturally contaminated with ZEN. These male wild boars were exposed to ZEN over a period of 1 year. Control animals were fed a placebo. Testicles with epididymides of the boars were collected on the last day of the experiment within 3 min after slaughter. Blood samples were collected from each of the male wild boars. Testes and epididymides were measured and sampled for histological examination. Epididymides were dissected and epididymal spermatozoa were harvested. The spermatozoa were diluted with swine-specific BTS extender and stored at 17°C for 144 h. Sperm motility was analyzed with CASA, and other parameters including viability, acrosome integrity, DNA fragmentation index, lipid peroxidation and apoptosis were assessed with flow cytometry. In these wild boars, per os exposure to natural sources of ZEN or a combination of ZEN and its metabolites changed the testicular interstitium and led to modification of some epididymal sperm parameters. The interstitial glands in testes of experimental group I were markedly reduced and hyperemic with evident blood stasis in small capillaries. Also in group I were single degenerating seminiferous tubules. In both groups I and II, immediately after dilution of spermatozoa with BTS remarkable decreases in motility rate as well as in progressive motility and the subpopulation of cells with rapid movement were noted compared with the control group (P < 0.05). But unexpectedly, after 24 h incubation of boar semen in the BTS diluent, these sperm properties improved and were not significantly different from the control group. Thus, exposure to ZEN has no lasting but only a temporary, reversible effect on wild boar sperm motility. There was no influence of exposure to ZEN and its metabolites on the integrity of membranes, intensity of lipid peroxidation and apoptosis or on sperm chromatin structure. This study is the first using these direct measures of sperm motility and integrity to show a redundant adverse effect of ZEN exposure on wild boar sperm characteristics. There were no effects of exposure to ZEN and its metabolites on body weight, testicular and epididymal biometry, gonadosomatic index and the concentration of testosterone in blood plasma in the male wild boars. © 2017","Biometry; Epididymis; Histology; Sperm characteristics; Testis; Testosterone; Wild boars; Zearalenone",

However, it is well known that fingerprint template stored in plaintext is vulnerable to attack. A secure fingerprint template has to be both non-invertible and non-linkable. Minutia cylinder-code (MCC) is a fixed-length and highly discriminative type of minutia descriptor. However, most of the current MCC based fingerprint matching algorithms do not possess the non-linkable property. In this paper, a secured fingerprint MCC matching scheme is proposed by utilizing l1-minimization, where the enrolled fingerprint MCC template is stored in cyphertext form (i.e., E-MCC) and is recognizable only when a close enough query fingerprint presented to the system. Our experimental results on FVC2002 DB1, FVC2002 DB2 and FVC2004 DB1 databases show that the proposed system is highly secure and accurate. The GAR with FAR=0 on FVC2002 DB1, FVC2002 DB2 and FVC2004 DB1 are 91.4%, 84.0% and 65.6%, respectively, with a security level of 33 bits.

Motivated by the child and adolescent behaviors in long-term evolution (CABLE) study, we are interested in individual, family, and school factors associated with marginal quantiles of longitudinal adolescent BMI values. We propose a new method for composite marginal quantile regression analysis for longitudinal outcome data, which performs marginal quantile regressions at multiple quantile levels simultaneously. The proposed method extends the quantile regression coefficient modeling method introduced by Frumento and Bottai (Biometrics 2016; 72:74–84) to longitudinal data accounting suitably for the correlation structure in longitudinal observations. A goodness-of-fit test for the proposed modeling is also developed. Simulation results show that the proposed method can be much more efficient than the analysis without taking correlation into account and the analysis performing separate quantile regressions at different quantile levels. The application to the longitudinal adolescent BMI data from the CABLE study demonstrates the practical utility of our proposal. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The IOL power was calculated using the SRK/T formula with Lenstar K and K readings from Sirius. Simulated K (SimK), K at 3-, 5-, and 7-mm zones from Sirius were compared with Lenstar K readings. The accuracy of these parameters was determined by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE). The mean Lenstar K value was 44.05 diopters (D) ±1.93 (SD) and SimK, K at 3-, 5-, and 7-mm zones were 43.85 ± 1.91, 43.88 ± 1.9, 43.84 ± 1.9, 43.66 ± 1.85 D, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the K readings (P = 0.901). When Lenstar was used for the corneal power measurements, MAE was 0.42 ± 0.33 D, but when simK of Sirius was used, it was 0.37 ± 0.32 D (the lowest MAE (0.36 ± 0.32 D) was achieved as a result of 5 mm K measurement), but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.892).

Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted among pregnant women who received prenatal care at a center in Recife, Brazil, between October 3, 2011, and September 27, 2013. Pre-pregnancy BMI was determined at the first prenatal care visit. Maternal visceral adiposity and fetal biometry were measured at the same ultrasonography session. The associations between maternal and fetal variables were evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (R). The Student t test was used to test the null hypothesis of adjusted correlation coefficients. Results: Overall, 740 women were included. No correlation was found between pre-pregnancy BMI and any of the fetal biometric variables assessed. By contrast, maternal visceral adiposity positively correlated with fetal abdominal circumference (R=0.529), estimated fetal weight (R=0.524), head circumference (R=0.521), femur length (R=0.521), and biparietal diameter (R=0.524; P<0.001 for all fetal variables).

This straw is beneficial for both soil and plant. However, there is no information about the sufficient quantity which can be used to achieve such effects and also whether it can be used in other sectors like electricity and ethanol production. Therefore, a research was designed with the objective to evaluate the effect of different amounts of straw on the development and productivity of sugarcane during the first and second ratoons. Treatments used in the experiment included: burned cane, 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% (20 t ha−1) of sugarcane straw left on the soil surface. The tested variables included leaf area index (LAI), number, diameter, length and production of stems. Plants were evaluated at 60, 120, 180, 240 and 370 days after harvest (DAH) for the first ratoon and at 60, 120, 180, 240 and 270 DAH for the second ratoon. Replacing burned cane harvest system for soil management with straw promotes the development and productivity of sugarcane ratoons. Field managements with burned cane, total removal of the straw, or keeping 25% of straw result in low number of tillers, leaf area index, stem diameter and productivity of sugarcane ratoons, under water stress conditions. Whereas keeping 50% of straw mulch is enough to improve the growth and yield of sugarcane with drought occurrences, while the remaining 50% can be used for second generation of ethanol production or electricity without damaging the crop yield. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural waste; Biomass; Biometry; Growing under straw; Saccharum spp; Soil cover","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Agronomy; Biomass; Ethanol; Harvesting; Incineration; Plants (botany); Productivity; Soils; Agriculture environments; Biometry; Ethanol production; Field management; Growth and yield; Saccharum spp; Second generation; Soil cover; Electric power generation; Saccharum"

We tested 2 hypotheses: (1) among DSBCS patients, second-eye outcomes were no different than first-eye outcomes; (2) averaged between each patient's 2 eyes, outcomes did not differ between ISBCS and DSBCS patients. Design Retrospective comparative-effectiveness study. Participants Kaiser Permanente Northern California members who underwent noncomplex bilateral cataract surgery from January 1, 2013, through June 30, 2015. Methods We performed an intention-to-treat analysis comparing ISBCS to DSBCS using conditional logistic regression analysis, accounting for surgeon and patient-level factors. Main Outcome Measures BCVA, RE. Results The analysis of visual outcomes included both eyes of 13 711 DSBCS and 3561 ISBCS patients. Because of the large sample size, some statistical differences lacked clinical significance. Ocular comorbidities were slightly more prevalent in DSBCS patients. Postoperative BCVA was 20/20 or better in 48% of DSBCS first eyes, 49% of DSBCS second eyes, 53% of ISBCS right eyes, and 51% of ISBCS left eyes. The within-person difference in postoperative BCVA averaged zero (0.00) between the first and second DSBCS eyes, and between the ISBCS right and left eyes. After adjustment, average postoperative BCVA was better in ISBCS patients, although the difference was not statistically significant (compared with 20/20 or better: odds ratio for worse than 20/20 was 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.83–1.01). Emmetropia (spherical equivalent −0.5 to 0 diopter) was achieved in 61% of first DSBCS eyes, 61% of second DSBCS eyes, 63% of ISBCS right eyes, and 63% of ISBCS left eyes. After adjustment, average postoperative RE was no different in ISBCS compared with DSBCS patients (compared with emmetropia: odds ratio for ametropia was 1.02, confidence interval 0.92–1.12). We confirmed 1 case of postoperative endophthalmitis in 10 494 ISBCS eyes (1.0 per 10 000 eyes) and 2 cases in 38 736 DSBCS eyes (0.5 per 10 000 eyes) (P = 0.6), and no patient had bilateral endophthalmitis.

The forearm offers a number of potential advantages in that it is a fairly accessible area, and, compared with other zones such as fingertips, is less exposed to the elements and more shielded from wear. Methods: We extract and combine skin textural features from two imaging devices (optical and capacitive) with the aim of discriminating between different individuals. Skin texture images from 43 subjects were acquired from three different body parts (back of the hand, forearm and palm); testing used the two sensors either separately or in combination. Results: Skin texture features from the forearm proved effective for discriminating between different individuals with overall recognition accuracy approaching 96%. Conclusions: We found that skin texture features from the forearm are highly individual-specific and therefore suitable for personal identification. Interestingly, forearm skin texture features yielded significantly better accuracy compared to the skin of the back of the hand and of the palm of the same subjects. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Our aim is to demonstrate the great dynamism of Romano-British animal husbandry, with substantial changes in livestock management occurring at the beginning, the end, and during the period under study. It is suggested that such changes are the product of interactions between different cultural and social traditions, which can be associated with indigenous and external influences, but also numerous other causes, ranging from ethnic origins to environmental, geographic, political, and economic factors. © European Association of Archaeologists 2017.","Animal husbandry; Biometry; Butchery; Early Anglo-Saxon period; Late Iron Age; Roman period; Zooarchaeology",

The present study was conducted to measure the effect of seasons on scrotal & testicular biometrics and endocrinological profiles for different age groups at different seasons in mithun bulls. A total of 30 mithun males were selected from the mithun breeding farm, ICAR-NRC on Mithun, Medziphema, Nagaland, India and were equally distributed into five groups based on their age. Each group consisted of six animals and the groups were Gr A (0.1–1.0 year), Gr B (1.1–2.0 years), Gr C (2.1–3.0 years), Gr D (3.1–5.0 years) and Gr E (5.1–6.0 years). The seasons were grouped into winter, spring, summer and autumn based on the meteorological data such as temperature humidity index (THI) and sunshine hours. Scrotal circumference (SC) & testicular biometrics and endocrinological profiles such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone/interstitial cell stimulating hormone (LH/ICSH), testosterone, thyroxine (T4), cortisol and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) were estimated during different seasons for different age groups. Statistical results revealed that the SC & testicular biometrics and endocrinological profiles differed significantly (p < 0.05) among the different age groups for the same season whereas SC and endocrinological profiles significantly (p < 0.05) differed among the seasons for same age group. Significantly (p < 0.05) greater SC and testicular weight were observed in Gr E and D, lower in Gr A and B and intermediate in Gr C and increased as age advances. Significantly (p < 0.05) greater SC was observed in winter and spring and lowest was in summer season. The hormone profiles such as FSH, LH/ICSH, testosterone & thyroxine were significantly (p < 0.05) greater and IGF-1 & cortisol were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in spring & winter than in summer season. The hormones, FSH, LH/ICSH and thyroxine increased significantly in Gr A followed by reduced in Gr B and then increased to Gr D and E, whereas concentration of testosterone, cortisol and IGF-1 increased according to age advanced.

In this assay, embryos are topically exposed, and survival, hatching success, malformations, biometry, behaviour, and target gene expression are subsequently analysed in each individual. This assay was applied to oxazepam, an anxiolytic pharmaceutical compound currently found in wastewater treatment plant effluent. Even if oxazepam accumulation in embryos was very low, it caused spinal and cardiac malformations, delayed growth, erratic swimming and deregulation of genes involved in apoptosis, DNA repair and mitochondrial metabolism. Relationship between gene deregulation, abnormal behaviour, and developmental anomalies was demonstrated. This assay is sensitive enough to detect adverse effects at low chemical concentrations and at multiple endpoints in a unique fish embryo. This integrative embryo-toxicity assay is a powerful tool to characterize the spectrum of effects of new chemicals and also to link effects induced at different molecular, tissue and physiological levels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Anxiolytic pharmaceutical; Behaviour; Fish embryo-toxicity assay; Gene expression; Individual analyses; Malformations",

Design Nonrandomized prospective multi-center study. Participants Thirty children, aged between 4 and 12 years, with unilateral high myopic anisometropic amblyopia were included in this study. Methods Patients who were prospectively subdivided into group A, with mean preoperative manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) of −12.96 ± 4.17 D, underwent unilateral phakic posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. Patients with mean preoperative MRSE of −8.60 ± 1.16 D in group B were treated by Intacs corneal rings. Pre- and postoperative visual acuity, ocular examination, stereoacuity, axial biometry measurements, cycloplegic refraction, and endothelial cell counts were performed in all patients. Results Group A revealed prevention of amblyopia with improvement in spectacle-corrected distance visual acuity, where 4–6 lines were achieved in 77% of children, 2–3 lines in 4%, and just 0–1 lines restricted to 19% of children. Improvement in stereoacuity was noted in 93.33% of group A cases, whereas group B showed fewer cases of successfully improved vision, with 4–6 lines in 70% of children, 2–3 lines in 3%, and just 0–1 lines restricted to 27% of children. Improvement in stereoacuity was noted in 86.66% of cases. Two cases of cataract and 1 case of glaucoma with 1 case of uveitis were noted in the implantable contact lens (ICL) group. Conclusions Posterior chamber PIOLs or Intacs may provide a safe alternative in treating anisometropic myopic patients. Intacs implantation is safer with fewer complications than ICL. However, ICL implantation is advantageous over the corneal ring segment procedure owing to the wide range of errors to correct. © 2017 Canadian Ophthalmological Society",,

Methods: Eighty patients (80 eyes) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Anterior chamber parameters, namely anterior chamber depth (ACD), angle-opening distance (AOD), iris–lens contact distance (ILCD), and trabecular-ciliary process distance (TCPD), among other parameters, were assessed by UBM (35 MHz), while axial length (AL) and lenticular thickness (LT) were determined by A-scan biometry. Absolute lenticular position (ALP) and relative lenticular position (RLP) were also compared. Results: The mean AL of eyes with PG was less (P = 0.64) than the mean AL of eyes with mature cataract. The mean ILCD value in eyes with PG (1.30 ± 0.78 mm) was significantly higher (P = 0.0015) than that in eyes with mature cataract (0.86 ± 0.32 mm). The mean AOD value in eyes with PG (0.15 ± 0.10 mm) was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.0001) than that in eyes with mature cataract (0.23 ± 0.06 mm); similarly, the mean RLP value in eyes with PG (0.20 ± 0.02) was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.0001) than that in eyes with mature cataract (0.17 ± 0.02). TCPD showed negative correlation with LT r = −0.514; P = 0.017, r2 = 0.264, in eyes with phacomorphic glaucoma and mature cataracts showed significant negative correlation of ILCD with AL (r = −0.575; P = 0.025, r2 = 0.330). Conclusion: The results of UBM examination suggest that there are multiple mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of PG, namely crowding of the anterior segment, increased iris–lens contact distance, and a more pronounced anterior shift of the lens. Simultaneous evaluation of anatomic and biometric parameters can improve diagnostic accuracy in predicting cases at risk for PG. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biometric parameters; Phacomorphic glaucoma; Primary angle-closure glaucoma; Ultrasound biomicroscopy",

Because umbilical venous blood transports nutrient substrate from the maternal to the fetal compartment and because the fetal liver is the primary organ in which nutrient interconversion occurs, it has been proposed that variations in the relative distribution of umbilical venous blood flow shunting either through ductus venosus or perfusing the fetal liver represents a mechanism underlying this adaptation. Objective The objective of the present study was to determine whether fetal liver blood flow assessed before the period of maximal fetal fat deposition (ie, the third trimester of gestation) is prospectively associated with newborn adiposity. Study Design A prospective study was conducted in a cohort of 62 uncomplicated singleton pregnancies. Fetal ultrasonography was performed at 30 weeks gestation for conventional fetal biometry and characterization of fetal liver blood flow (quantified by subtracting ductus venosus flow from umbilical vein flow). Newborn body fat percentage was quantified by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry imaging at 25.8 ± 3.3 (mean ± standard error of the mean) postnatal days. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the proportion of variation in newborn body fat percentage explained by fetal liver blood flow. Potential confounding factors included maternal age, parity, prepregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain, gestational age at birth, infant sex, postnatal age at dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, and mode of infant feeding. Results Newborn body fat percentage was 13.5% ± 2.4% (mean ± standard error of the mean). Fetal liver blood flow at 30 weeks gestation was significantly and positively associated with newborn total fat mass (r=0.397; P&lt;.001) and body fat percentage (r=0.369; P=.004), but not with lean mass (r=0.100; P=.441). After accounting for the effects of covariates, fetal liver blood flow explained 13.5% of the variance in newborn fat mass. The magnitude of this association was pronounced particularly in nonoverweight/nonobese mothers (prepregnancy body mass index, &lt;25 kg/m2; n=36) in whom fetal liver blood flow explained 24.4% of the variation in newborn body fat percentage. Conclusion Fetal liver blood flow at the beginning of the third trimester of gestation is associated positively with newborn adiposity, particularly among nonoverweight/nonobese mothers. This finding supports the role of fetal liver blood flow as a putative fetal adaptation underlying variation in adipose tissue accretion. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","body composition; body fat percentage; fetal ultrasonography; liver blood flow; prepregnancy body mass index",

The normal registration procedure does not apply to them because presently they do not meet the legal requirements for a full license as set out in the relevant European Union Directive. One of these requirements, “proof of tradition”, has so far been dealt with in different ways and fails to meet the criteria of good practice. Method This analysis is based on a selective literature search in PubMed and in databases of medical and pharmaceutical history, interviews with licensing experts, a consensus meeting attended by researchers with a background in general medicine, phytotherapy, medical and pharmaceutical history, biometry, ethnopharmacology, pharmacognosy and the pharmaceutical industry. Results and discussion The 2004 EU Directive, which governs the registration of Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products and demands proof of tradition, is a regulatory construct and, above all, the outcome of a political process that has ended in a pragmatic compromise. The concept of tradition applied in the Directive does not sufficiently reflect the semantic breadth of the term. The only condition defined is that a specific commercial preparation needs to have been on the market for 30 years (15 of them inside the EU). Such an approach does not make full scientific use of the evidence available because the information excerpted from historical sources, if adequately processed, may yield valuable insights. This applies to indications, modes of application, efficacy and product safety (innocuousness). Such criteria should enter in full into the benefit-risk-analysis of applied preparations, in the registration process as well as in the therapeutic practice. Conclusion When registering Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products the criterion of evidence-based medicine will only be met if all the facts available are assessed and evaluated, over and above the formally stipulated regulatory provisions (30 years, product reference). To this end, the scientific methods (from among the natural, life or cultural sciences), which are recognized as authoritative in each case, must be applied. © 2017 The Authors",,

Methods: Fifty six normal term women were recruited at Ain Shams Maternity Hospital, Egypt from 14 May to 30 November 2015. Fetal weight was estimated by Hadlock’s IV formula using 2DUS and 5D LB. Estimated fetal weights (EFW) by 2DUS and 5D LB were compared with actual birth weights (ABW). Results: Mean femur length (FL) was 7.07 ± 0.73 cm and 6.74 ± 0.67 cm by 2DUS and 5D LB (p = .02). EFW was 3309.86 ± 463.06 g by 2DUS and 3205.46 ± 447.85 g by 5D LB (p = .25). No statistical difference was observed between ABW and EFW by 2DUS (p = .7) or 5D LB (p = .45). Positive correlation was found between EFW by 2DUS, 5D LB, and ABW (r = 0.67 and 0.7; p < .001). There was strong agreement between FL measured by 2DUS and 5D LB (ICC = 0.78), and perfect agreement between EFW by 2DUS and EFW by 5D LB (ICC = 0.918). 2DUS and 5D LB showed mean absolute percentage error for EFW of 10 ± 7% and 8 ± 7% compared to ABW (p = .15).

METHODS:: A total of 733 pediatric eyes were included in the study retrospectively. All eyes underwent corneal tomography (Pentacam), RE assessment, and air-puff deformation (Corvis-ST). Waveform analyses of deformation provided corneal stiffness (CS) and extraocular tissue stiffness (EOS). Eyes were subgrouped into emmetropia [manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) ∼ 0 D], hyperopia (MRSE > 0 D), myopia I (MRSE between 0 D and −3 D), myopia II (MRSE between −3 D and −6 D), and myopia III (MRSE greater than −6 D) for multivariate analyses. Ocular biometry variables [age, intraocular pressure (IOP), central corneal thickness (CCT), corneal astigmatism, anterior chamber depth, and RE] were used as covariates. The apparent elastic modulus (E) was defined as the ratio of CS and CCT. RESULTS:: All groups had similar age, CCT, and IOP (P > 0.05). CS was the only parameter to differ between all the grades of myopia (P < 0.0001). CS was lower by 3.72%, 6.84%, and 10.68% in myopia I, II, and III eyes, respectively, relative to emmetropic eyes. EOS increased by 11.15%, 22.60%, and 28.5%, respectively. Multivariate regression revealed age, IOP, CCT, corneal astigmatism, anterior chamber depth, and RE as significant predictors of CS, with a high coefficient of regression (R = 0.66). Corneal E negatively correlated with the grade of myopia. CONCLUSIONS:: CS and EOS correlated negatively and positively with the grade of myopia, respectively. Ocular biometry variables were significant predictors of both CS and EOS. The decrease in CS was attributed to that in elastic modulus. Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Methods: A literature search was performed. The following data were obtained: Iris-claw IOL model, Iridal or retroiridal enclavation, A-constant, ultrasound or optical biometry, formula employed and refractive outcomes. Acceptable emmetropia was considered if the resulting spherical equivalent (SE) was within ±1.00 D. Results: The majority of the studies used SRK/T formula (66.6%). The 88.9% of the reports obtained a SE within ±1.00 D. Using A-115 for ultrasound biometry and A-115.7 for optical biometry and SRK/T formula, the emmetropia (±1.00 D) of SE, was able to get near 100% of reported cases over the pupil implantation. However, the emmetropia decreased to 80% when the enclavation is retropupilar using the same formula. The A-constant can vary from 116.7 to 117.5 for retropupilar enclavation. Conclusions: Using A-115 for ultrasound biometry and A-115.7 for optical biometry and SRK/T formula, ±1.00 D of SE, is able to get near 100% of cases. Nevertheless, ±1.00 D of SE decreased to 80% of the cases when the enclavation is retropupilar. © 2017 The Author(s).","Artisan aphakia; IOL-in-the bag dislocation; Iris-claw IOL; Late cataract surgery complication; Verysise",

However, the methodology study is rately seen in China within our knowledge. Objective: The present study was to investigate the repeatability and reproducibility of IVAN software in measuring retinal vascular caliber. Methods: This study was approved by Ethic Committee of Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, and written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to medical examination. A prospectively diagnostic trail was performed. The digitized fundus color photograph centered on the disc from 192 eyes of 96 healthy volunteers were collected in Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University from January, 2013 to December, 2014, and central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE), central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE) and arteriovenous ratio (AVR) were analyzed by IVAN measurement software. The repeatability and reproducibility of IVAN software for random repeat measurement of retinal vessel caliber from consecutive 85 right eyes of 85 volunteers were evaluation by interobserver and intraobserver measurement with interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The correlations of measuring results between two observers or two-time measuring were analyzed with Pearson linear correlation analysis. Bland-Altman agreeement analysis was employed to assess the agreeement of the outcomes. Results: No significant differences were found in CRAE, CRVE and AVR between the right eyes and the left eyes (t=-1.009, 1.090, -1.259, all at P>0.05). The CRAE, CRVE and AVR values from observer 1 were (145.02±12.94) μm, (400.72±9.12) μm and 0.36±0.03, and those from observer 2 were (145.10±11.86) μm, (401.17±9.85) μm and 0.36±0.03, with no significant differences between observer 1 and observer 2 (t=-0.074, -0.913, 0.116, all at P>0.05). The repeat CRAE, CRVE and AVR values from observer 1 were (145.02±12.94) μm, (400.72±9.12) μm and 0.36±0.03, which were significantly different from the initial values (t=-0.777, -0.048, -0.745, all at P>0.05). In two-time measurements of intraobserver, all ICC were ≥0.738 and showed good correlations (all at r≥0.739). The two measurements of interobserver, showed good correlations (r≥0.662), with all ICC≥0.657. Bland-Altman plots showed good agreements in CRAE and CRVE measurement with 95% limits of agreement (LoA) ranged from -18.5 μm to 17.3 μm and -9.8 μm to 9.6 μm in intraobserver, and from -19.3 μm to 20.0 μm and -10.2 μm to 9.0 μm in interobserver, respectively.

The present work deals with the murid faunas of the well-known late Miocene locality of Venta del Moro, comprising over 2700 molars ascribed to the taxa Apodemus gorafensis, Occitanomys alcalai, Paraethomys meini and Stephanomys dubari. This list differs from those of previous studies by the presence of A. gorafensis instead of A. gudrunae. The presence of A. gudrunae in younger localities than Venta del Moro implies that both species, considered ancestor and descendant, coexisted for some time. In addition, the analysis of such an extensive collection has allowed us to check the variability of the studied species in great detail, such as the development of the longitudinal connections of O. alcalai, to a greater extent than previously described. Finally, we discuss the biometrical changes of the lineages of Paraethomys in Southern Europe from MN13 to MN15, and hypothesize about the mechanisms behind these variations in size. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biometry; character displacement; late Miocene; Muridae; Spain; Venta del Moro","Apodemus; Muridae; Paraethomys"

However, there has been little investigation of its influence on foetal haemodynamics, particularly in appropriately grown foetuses. Methods: This cohort study was undertaken between July 2013 and November 2013. All participants underwent an ultrasound scan prior to active labour (<4 cm dilated), during which foetal biometry, umbilical and middle cerebral artery Dopplers were recorded. Doppler measurements were then repeated after a 20-min period (to act as a control for subsequent measurements after oxygen therapy). Women were then asked to breathe 60% oxygen through Venturi valve masks for 20 min, after which the Doppler measurements were repeated. Results: Twenty women were recruited to the study. No significant change in the foetal cerebro-umbilical (CU) ratio was observed following maternal oxygen therapy. The degree of change in Doppler parameters after oxygen therapy was not related to the baseline value of the Doppler parameter.

The aim of this study was to quantify brain growth in normal fetuses using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and to produce reference biometry data and a freely available centile calculator (https://www.developingbrain.co.uk/fetalcentiles/). A total of 127 MRI examinations (1.5 T) of fetuses with a normal brain appearance (21–38 gestational weeks) were included in this study. 2D and 3D biometric parameters were measured from slice-to-volume reconstructed images, including 3D measurements of supratentorial brain tissue, lateral ventricles, cortex, cerebellum and extra-cerebral CSF and 2D measurements of brain biparietal diameter and fronto-occipital length, skull biparietal diameter and occipitofrontal diameter, head circumference, transverse cerebellar diameter, extra-cerebral CSF, ventricular atrial diameter, and vermis height, width, and area. Centiles were constructed for each measurement. All participants were invited for developmental follow-up. All 2D and 3D measurements, except for atrial diameter, showed a significant positive correlation with gestational age. There was a sex effect on left and total lateral ventricular volumes and the degree of ventricular asymmetry. The 5th, 50th, and 95th centiles and a centile calculator were produced. Developmental follow-up was available for 73.1% of cases [mean chronological age 27.4 (±10.2) months]. We present normative reference charts for fetal brain MRI biometry at 21–38 gestational weeks.

We measured localized changes occurring in the foveal cone photoreceptors and related defects in the cone mosaic to alterations in the nearby retinal vasculature. METHODS. The central 4° of the retina of 54 diabetic (53.7 ± 12.5 years) and 85 control (35.8 ± 15.2 years) participants were imaged with the Indiana adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Foveal cones and overlying retinal capillaries were imaged and infrared scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (IR SLO) images and optical coherence tomography (OCT) Bscans were obtained. Follow-up imaging sessions were performed with intervals from 4 to 50 months for 22 of the 54 diabetic participants. RESULTS. The foveal cone mosaics of 49 of 54 diabetic participants were of sufficient quality to assess the absence or presence of small localized defects in the cone mosaic. In 13 of these 49 diabetic participants we found localized defects, visualized as sharp-edged areas of cones with diminished reflectivity. These small, localized areas ranged in size from 10 × 10 μm to 75 × 30 μm. Of these 13 participants with cone defects, 11 were imaged over periods from 4 to 50 months and the defects remained relatively stable. These dark regions were not shadows of overlying retinal vessels, but all participants with these localized defects had alterations in the juxtafoveal capillary network. CONCLUSIONS. The foveal cone mosaic can show localized areas of dark cones that persist over time, that apparently correspond to either missing or nonreflecting cones, and may be related to local retinal ischemia. © 2017, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

Based on a literature review, the evidence for the use of biomarkers in the management of infections was analyzed. The physiological inflammatory response and the role of classical inflammation markers, such as C‑reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), hematological (blood count) and new laboratory biomarkers (e. g. transcriptome and proteome analyses) are described. It is discussed whether a general screening with laboratory markers makes sense in emergency situations, whether laboratory biomarkers can differentiate between bacterial and non-bacterial infections and how well they are qualified for the early detection and evaluation of the course of SBI. On a purely statistical basis, the values of classical biomarkers, such as CRP and PCT are higher in bacterial than in viral infections; however, in the individual case a single, isolated CRP or PCT value does not reliably help to differentiate. The combined use of findings from taking a patient history/physical examination (clinical biometric biomarkers) and laboratory biomarkers is the most successful approach to improve early detection of SBI. Except in neonatology reliable data regarding the benefit of laboratory biomarkers for assessment of progress and steering therapy are missing. A more critical use of laboratory biomarkers in Pediatrics would be desirable in order to prevent unnecessary medical interventions and therapy in children. © 2017, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH.","Bacterial infections; Cytokines; Early diagnosis of sepsis; Procalcitonin; Viral infections","biological marker; C reactive protein; procalcitonin; proteome; transcriptome; bacterial infection; biometry; blood cell count; human; immunological parameters; infection; inflammation; medical history; physical examination; proteomics; Review; transcriptomics; virus infection"

The algorithm overcomes the inherent limitations of the US image modality: Nonuniform density; missing boundaries; and strong speckle noise. We introduced a 'guitar' structure that represents the negative space surrounding the thalamic regions. The guitar acts as a landmark for deriving the widest points of the thalamus even when its boundaries are not identifiable. We augmented a generalized level-set framework with a shape prior and constraints derived from statistical shape models of the guitars; this framework was used to segment US images and measure the thalamic diameter. Our segmentation method achieved a higher mean Dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance, specificity, and reduced contour leakage when compared to other well-established methods. The automatic thalamic diameter measurement had an interobserver variability of-0.56 2.29 mm compared to manual measurement by an expert sonographer. Our method was capable of automatically estimating the thalamic diameter, with the measurement accuracy on par with clinical assessment.

The search for and identification of missing children is often hampered, among others, by the fact that the facial morphology of long-term missing children changes as they grow. Nowadays, the wide coverage by surveillance systems potentially provides image material for comparisons with images of missing children that may facilitate identification. The aim of study was to identify whether facial features are stable in time and can be utilized for facial recognition by comparing facial images of children at different ages as well as to test the possible use of moles in recognition. The study was divided into two phases (1) morphological classification of facial features using an Anthropological Atlas; (2) algorithm developed in MATLAB® R2014b for assessing the use of moles as age-stable features. The assessment of facial features by Anthropological Atlases showed high mismatch percentages among observers. On average, the mismatch percentages were lower for features describing shape than for those describing size. The nose tip cleft and the chin dimple showed the best agreement between observers regarding both categorization and stability over time. Using the position of moles as a reference point for recognition of the same person on age-different images seems to be a useful method in terms of objectivity and it can be concluded that moles represent age-stable facial features that may be considered for preliminary recognition. © 2017 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences","Face; Missing children; Mole; Morphological atlas; Photographs; Soft biometrics","biometry; child; chin; classification; controlled study; facial recognition; facies; human; human experiment; morphology; nose apex; photography"

Methods: In this retrospective comparative case series, IOL power was calculated with the Haigis, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, and SRK/T formulas in two groups of eyes undergoing phacoemulsification and implantation of an aspherical IOL (Acrysof SN60WF; Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX). For each formula, the refractive prediction error was calculated once the constants had been optimized. Biometric data were obtained by partial coherence interferometry in one group and immersion ultrasound biometry and corneal topography in the other. Corneal asphericity was assessed by two different corneal topographers in the optical biometry group (Magellan; Nidek, Gamagori, Japan) and ultrasound biometry group (Keratron, Optikon 2000 Spa, Rome, Italy). Results: The mean Q-value was -0.12 ± 0.08 in the optical biometry group (n = 51) and -0.22 ± 0.14 in the ultrasound biometry group (n = 79). In both groups, linear regression disclosed a statistically significant correlation between the Q-value and the prediction error (the only exception being the SRK/T formula). More negative Q-values were correlated to a positive prediction error, indicating a myopic outcome for prolate corneas. However, the correlation coefficients were lower than those previously reported for spherical IOLs. Conclusions: Corneal asphericity also influences the refractive outcomes of IOL power calculation by thin-lens formulas when aspherical IOLs are implanted, although this influence is exerted to a lesser degree compared to spherical IOLs.

We investigated the nuptial gifts of a gift-giving spider, Pisaura mirabilis, consisting of both exogenous (prey) and endogenous (silk) components and their relationships to male biometry (the honest signalling hypothesis) and personality traits (the personality traits hypothesis). The gift's weight in the field was positively correlated with male size providing support for the honest signalling hypothesis. No differences in body condition and fluctuating asymmetry between males carrying and not carrying gifts in the field were found which does not support the honest signalling hypothesis. A substantial proportion of males offered worthless gifts that were smaller and lighter than genuine gifts. Reliable personality traits of males were not identified and no behavioural or survival differences between males carrying nuptial gifts, unwrapped prey and not carrying gifts in the field were observed. These results suggest that male size serves as an honest indicator of the exogenous component of the gift (i.e. the nuptial prey). © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","fluctuating asymmetry; handicap principle; nuptial feeding; personality; Pisaura mirabilis","Araneae"

Methods: Twenty-five eyes of twenty-five healthy subjects, whose mean age was 29.9±7.1 years, were included and measured with an anterior chamber OCT. The central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior crystalline lens radius of curvature (ALRC), crystalline lens thickness (CLT), and ciliary muscle area (CMA) were measured for each participant at 0, –1, –2, and –3 D of target vergence. A linear model was used to assess the correlation of each eye parameter with the vergence demand. Results: The mean CCT showed no change for all the accommodative stimuli. The mean ACD and ALRC decreased with the vergence, about 4.5 and 30 % at –3 D, respectively. On the contrary, the CLT and CMA showed an opposite tendency, where the mean CLT was increased by 4.0 % and the mean CMA was done by 26% at –3 D. Statistical significant differences (p < 0.001) were obtained among all vergences for each eye metric, except for the CCT (p = 0.76). Conclusion: The ACD and ALRC decreased about 2 and 10 % per dioptre of accommodation, respectively; whereas the CLT and CMA increased about 2 and 9 %, respectively. These results add knowledge regarding the understanding of accommodation and give new perspectives for biomechanics and biometry. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Accommodation; Ciliary muscle; Lens morphology",

There is limited information related to community-based study to evaluate early indicators related to miscarriage. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between fetal growth restriction, measured by ultrasound crown-rump length (CRL), and subsequent occurrence of miscarriage in pregnant women in rural Bangladesh. The study was conducted within the Maternal and Infant Nutrition Interventions Trial in Matlab (MINIMat study), Bangladesh. A total of 4436 pregnant women were enrolled in the study when they were at less than 14 gestational weeks. The expected CRL was determined based on an established growth curve of gestational age and CRL, and deviation from this curve of CRL was expressed as a z-score. After identifying related covariates, the multiple Poisson regression model was used to determine the independent contribution from the CRL to miscarriage. A total of 3058 singleton pregnant women were included in analyses, with 92 miscarriages and 2966 continued pregnancies. The occurrence of miscarriages was significantly higher in the smaller categories of CRL z-score after adjustments for maternal age, parity, early pregnancy BMI, gestational age at CRL measurement and socioeconomic status (adjusted relative risk [95% confidence interval]: 1.03 [1.02–1.05] for less than -2 z-score). In a rural Bangladesh population, smaller than expected CRL for the gestational age was related to subsequent miscarriage. Ultrasound biometry information together with careful clinical assessment should provide much needed attention and care for pregnant women. © 2017 Rashid et al.

We present a case of a unilateral fetal pleural effusion identified at 35th gestational week. A 37 year-old woman (G2P1) presented to our routine term pregnancy evaluation. The pregnancy had been otherwise uneventful. At ecographic evaluation a large anechogenic fluid collection was identified in the right fetal hemithorax, with atelectasis of right lung, displacing the heart and mediastinal structures to the contralateral hemithorax. Hydramnios was also identified. No other structural abnormalities were detected, as no signs of hydrops. Fetal biometry was compatible with gestational age. Fetal ecochardiogram was structurally and functionally normal. Doppler evaluation of the peak systolic velocity in the middle cerebral artery was normal. Screening for congenital infections was negative. Complete blood cell count, blood type and antibody screening rulled-out immune hydrops. Karyotype analysis was not performed as family decision. Serial ecographic re-evaluations showed a progressive volume decrease and at the 38th week there was total resolution of the effusion. A C-section was performed at the 39th week. A live female infant was born weighing 3205 g, with no need of ventilatory support. One year post-partum follow-up evaluation confirmed the child was healthy. Spontaneous regression has been reported to occur in 9–22% of primary fetal hydrothoraxes, but the features predicting a better prognosis remain difficult to define. Unilateral effusion, spontaneous resolution and absence of hydrops at the age of diagnosis seem to be indicators of better outcome. © 2017 The Authors","Fetal hydrothorax",

Abnormal ADC values are seen in ischemic brain lesions, such as those associated with acute or chronic hypoxia. The aim of this study was to assess whether ADC values in the fetal brain were different in fetuses with severe intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) compared with normal controls. Methods: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with single-shot axial DWI (b = 0 and b = 700 s/mm2) was performed in 30 fetuses with severe IUGR (estimated fetal weight &lt; 3rd centile with absent or reversed umbilical artery Doppler flow) and in 24 normal controls of similar gestational age. Brain morphology and biometry were analyzed. ADC values were measured in frontal and occipital white matter, centrum semiovale, thalami, cerebellar hemisphere and pons. Frontal–occipital and frontal–cerebellar ADC ratios were calculated, and values were compared between IUGR fetuses and controls. Results: There was no difference in gestational age at MRI between IUGR and control fetuses (IUGR, 30.2 ± 1.6 weeks vs controls, 30.7 ± 1.4 weeks). Fetal brain morphology and signals were normal in all fetuses. Brain dimensions (supratentorial ± infratentorial) were decreased (Z-score, &lt; –2) in 20 (66.7%) IUGR fetuses. Compared with controls, IUGR fetuses had significantly lower ADC values in frontal white matter (1.97 ± 0.23 vs 2.17 ± 0.22 × 10–3 mm2/s; P &lt; 0.0001), thalami (1.04 ± 0.15 vs 1.13 ± 0.10 ×10–3 mm2/s; P = 0.0002), centrum semiovale (1.86 ± 0.22 vs 1.97 ± 0.23 ×10–3 mm2/s; P = 0.01) and pons (0.85 ± 0.19 vs 0.94 ± 0.12 ×10–3 mm2/s; P = 0.043). IUGR fetuses had a lower frontal–occipital ADC ratio than did normal fetuses (1.00 ± 0.11 vs 1.08 ± 0.05; P = 0.003). Conclusions: ADC values in IUGR fetuses were significantly lower than in normal controls in the frontal white matter, thalami, centrum semiovale and pons, suggesting abnormal maturation in these regions. However, the prognostic value of these ADC changes is still unknown. Copyright © 2016 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. Copyright © 2016 ISUOG.

The size of the proloculus of the megalospheric forms of reticulate species helped recognise N. fabianii–N. fichteli lineage in western Tethys. Unlike the species of this lineage, N. ptukhiani, described from Armenia, is characterised by an unusually large proloculus. A possibly second lineage of reticulate species comprising N. ptukhiani is recently reported from Lutetian–Bartonian succession of Tanzania. The present study examines reticulate species from palaeogeographically adjacent Bartonian succession of Kutch. The statistical analysis of the biometric data suggests the presence of three distinct species, referred to Nummulites ptukhiani, N. aff. hormoensis and N. acutus. The reticulation starts developing in N. acutus that ranges from P13 to P14 in its type locality, Kutch. We infer that Nummulites ptukhiani and N. aff. hormoensis possibly evolved from N. acutus in Zone P14.

Methods: Retrospective analysis of 108 eyes (70 patients) underwent uneventful phacoemulsification surgery with implant of Alcon-SN60WF intraocular lens (IOL). Forty-five eyes were intentionally targeted to myopia (−0.75 to −1.25 dpt), while the others targeted between 0 and −0.75 dpt. Preoperative axial length and keratometry (K) were measured with optical biometry (LENSTAR—Haag-Streit). Postoperative spherical equivalent was assessed 3 ± 2 months after surgery. Results: There is a significant correlation between the mean keratometry (K) and the Haigis–SRKT prediction differences (P < 0.001; r = 0.749). Linear regression indicates that a decrease of 1 diopter (D) on K implies an increase of 0.23 D on the difference between formulae prediction. K alone does not influence the prediction error for both formulas. The difference between the two formulae is dependent on K (r = −0.75; P < 0.01). Moreover, eyes with K <43.75 targeted at myopia (n = 23) showed a significant myopic shift of −0.26 ± 0.09 dpt (P < 0.05) with Haigis, but a hyperopic shift of 0.24 ± 0.09 dpt (P < 0.05) with SRKT. Conclusion: Divergences between Haigis and SRKT formulae cause uncertainty in choosing the IOL. Our results indicate that, in eyes with lower preoperative K, an IOL targeted at myopia might result in a small, but significant myopic shift with the Haigis formula, while a hyperopic shift with the SRKT formula. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Biometry; Cataract surgery; Intraocular lens; Monovision; Myopia; Phacoemulsification",

No published reports from routine SSA cataract services attain the WHO benchmarks for visual outcomes; poor outcomes (<6/60) often comprise 20% in published case series. This Delphi exercise aimed to identify and prioritise potential interventions for improving the quality of cataract surgery in SSA to guide research and eye health programme development. Methods: An initial email open-question survey created a ranked list of priorities for improving quality of surgical services. A second-round face-to-face discussion facilitated at a Vision 2020 Research Mentorship Workshop in Tanzania created a refined list for repeated ranking. Results: Seventeen factors were agreed that might form target interventions to promote quality of cataract services. Improved training of surgeons was the top-ranked item, followed by utilisation of biometry, surgical equipment availability, effective monitoring of outcomes of cataract surgery by the surgeon, and well-trained support staff for the cataract pathway (including nurses seeing post-operative cases). Conclusion: Improving the quality of cataract surgery in SSA is a clinical, programmatic and public health priority. In the absence of other evidence, the collective expert opinion of those involved in ophthalmic services regarding the ranking of factors to promote quality improvement, refined through this Delphi exercise, provides us with candidate intervention areas to be evaluated. © 2017 The Author(s)","Cataract; Delphi technique; Quality improvement; Sub-Saharan Africa",

Patients had a complete ophthalmic examination, preoperatively and 1, 7, and 30 days after surgery. The achieved spherical equivalent (SE) and the prediction error (PE) were calculated. The prediction error was defined as the difference between attempted predicted target refraction and the achieved postoperative SE refraction. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS V21. Results: The mean age of the patients was 66.96±9.67 years, the mean AL was 23.29±0.62 mm, the mean K1 was 43.62±1.49D, the mean K2 was 43.69±1.53D, the mean IOL power was 21.066±1.464D, the mean attempted (predicted) SE was -0.178±0.266D, and the mean achieved SE was -0.252±0.562D. The mean PE (difference between predicted and achieved SE) showed a relatively hyperopic shift (mean ± standard deviation: 0.074±0.542D, ranging from -1.855 to 2.170D, P=0.001). A total of 93.87% of eyes were within ±1.00D of the PE and 92.75% of eyes within ±1.00D of achieved postoperative refraction. A total of 39 eyes (7.25%) had a refractive surprise. A total of 32 of 39 eyes were more myopic than -1.00D and 7 of them were more hypermetropic than +1.00D. There was no correlation between the mean PE and IOL type, AL, K1, K2, and IOLp. There were a positive statistically significant correlation between PE and age (r=0.095; P=0.028) and a negative statistically significant correlation between achieved SE and AL (Spearman’s r=-0.125; P=0.04), and age (r=-0.141; P=0.01). Conclusion: The IOLp calculation using the SRK/T formula with US biometry may demonstrate very good postoperative refractive outcomes in medium eyes with a few refractive surprises. © 2017 Karabela et al.","Axial length; Biometry; Cataract surgery; IOL power calculation; Prediction error; SRK/T formula",

However, the boundary incompleteness and ambiguity in US images hinder the automatic solutions severely. In this paper, we propose a cascaded framework for fully automatic US image segmentation. A customized Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) was utilized to exploit feature extractions from multiple visual scales and distinguish the anatomy with a dense prediction map. To enhance the local spatial consistency of the prediction map, we further implant the FCN core into an Auto-Context scheme. By modifying the join operator in traditional Auto-Context scheme from parallelization to summation, our framework gains extra considerable improvement. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two challenging datasets: fetal head and abdomen US images. Extensive experimental results show that our method can bridge severe boundary incompleteness and achieves the best segmentation accuracy when compared with state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 IEEE.","Auto-context; Fully convolutional networks; Image segmentation; Join operator; Prenatal ultrasound","Convolution; Medical imaging; Ultrasonics; Auto-context; Convolutional networks; Join operators; Prenatal ultrasound; Segmentation accuracy; Segmentation methods; Spatial consistency; State-of-the-art methods; Image segmentation"

Many studies included biometry of posterior features of hip bone. Very few studies are reported involving the biometry of anterior features of the hip bone. Anterior features of hip bone are important especially, if there is damage to the posterior features of hip bone in cases involving deliberate disfigurement of the body to resist identification of the crime in medicolegal cases. Aim: The present study was done to evaluate the effectiveness of anterior border parameters of the hip bone for prediction of sex using discriminant function analysis in South Indian population. Materials and Methods: A total of 206 dry bones were used (121 male and 85 female) and parameters like the distance between pubic tubercle and anterior rim of acetabulum, vertical acetabular diameter, transverse acetabular diameter, and the distance between pubic tubercle to highest point on the iliopubic eminence were measured using Vernier calipers. Normally distributed variables were compared using Students t-test to analyse the significance. Results: There was significant difference between the male and female hip bones of the observed variables with p-value less than 0.05. In parameters like the distance between pubic tubercle to anterior rim of acetabulum and distance between the highest points on iliopubic eminence to pubic tubercle the values were more in female when compared to males. In parameters like vertical and transverse acetabular diameters the values in males were more when compared to females. Conclusion: These parameters of hip bone can be utilised for sex determination in South Indian population. © 2017, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included 807 adult patients who had cataract surgery between years 2014 and 2016 at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Adult patients of white, Asian, Hispanic and African-American ethnicity were included. Lens position (LP), defined as anterior chamber depth (ACD) + 1/2 lens thickness (LT), was assessed using measurements from optical biometry. Other assessed biometric parameters included axial length (AL), relative lens position (RLP) (defined as LP/AL), and anterior chamber depth (ACD). Results: A total of 807 patients and 1361 eyes were included in this study from a database of patients having cataract surgery. Mean age was 69.2 years (age range from 18 to 101 years old), and 60.3% of patients were women. The mean LP measurements were 5.54±0.32mm for white, 5.38±0.32 mm for Asian, 5.32±0.30mm for Hispanic, and 5.40±0.28mm for African-American participants. After adjusting for age, sex, and AL, significant differences were found when comparing LP in paired comparisons among White cohort with Asians (P<0.001), Hispanics (P<0.001) and African-Americans (P = 0.003). Additionally, when comparing RLP, similar significant results were found when comparing Whites with Asians (P<0.001), Hispanics (P<0.001) and African-Americans (P = 0.002). Lastly, pair-wise comparison of LT between ethnic groups showed significant differences while comparing Asians with Whites (P = 0.001) and Asians with African-Americans (P<0.001). Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that the LP of Hispanic, Asian, and African-American patients are significantly smaller than that of White patients, and among all ethnic groups, Hispanics and after Asians have the smallest LP (P<0.001) and RLP (P<0.001). These findings may have implications for the relative risk of angle closure and the potential IOP response after cataract surgery among different ethnic groups.",,

Furthermore, a cutoff point was chosen to determine the corpus luteum (CL) functionality by luteal biometry (LB) measurement and luteal blood flow (LBF) assessment. Ultrasound assessment was carried out daily throughout an entire estrous cycle (21 days) in 23 Saanen goats pre-synchronized and inseminated in the breeding season. The plasmatic P4 concentration was determined daily by radioimmunoassay. LB parameters (diameter, area, and volume) were measured using the maximum area of a cross-section of the CL. LBF assessment was performed subjectively by percentage of area of colored pixels and objectively by calculating the number of the colored pixels. Eventually, 45.0% (9/20) and 55.0% (11/20) of goats became pregnant and or remained non-pregnant, respectively. The LB and LBF demonstrated value stabilization on the 9th day of the estrous cycle and maximum values on the 12th and 13th days of the estrous cycle, respectively. LB presented a progressive decrease in the luteal regression phase, whereas the LBF decreased abruptly in association with P4. The LBF values were more reliable in predicting the luteal functionality when compared to the LB data. The number of colored pixels accurately predicted values of P4 >1.0 ng/mL, reaching only 17% of the maximum values, and 1200 colored pixels as a minimum cutoff point when compared to the use of 53% of the maximum values and a minimum luteal diameter of 9.0 mm as cutoff point for P4 >1.0 ng/mL. The LBF assessment was more informative about the CL functionality throughout the complete luteal phase when compared to the LB. The use of the number of colored pixels is indicated for research regarding luteal functionality due to their greater correlation with P4 values. In addition, the luteal subjective evaluation can be used under field conditions due to greater convenience and similar pattern of correlation with P4. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Color Doppler ultrasound; Does; Luteinized-persistent follicle; Number of colored pixels; Progesterone",

Routine sonographic estimation of GA by using Biparietal Diameter (BPD), Femur Length (FL), Abdominal Circumference (AC) and Head Circumference (HC) assumed important role in management of pregnancy. However, these parameters have limitations. BPD and HC are not reliable in case of moulding of foetal head in third trimester. Similarly, femur length is shortened in cases of achondroplasia. Transcerebellar Diameter (TCD) was developed as an alternative parameter of foetal brain growth and for estimation of GA. Aim: To evaluate accuracy of predicting GA using Foetal Transcerebellar Diameter (TCD) and to compare between TCD and other existing parameters in evaluating GA in 15 to 40 weeks of gestation. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was carried out in 100 pregnant women between 15 to 40 weeks of gestation, who came for routine antenatal sonography. Transcerebellar diameter was measured along with routine parameters. Subjects were divided into two groups based on GA (15-28 and 29-40 weeks). Gestational age using TCD and other parameters was calculated and compared with gestational age based on Last Menstrual Period (LMP). Correlation between the GA by LMP with GA by other ultrasound parameters was done by using Karl Pearson’s Correlation(r). Results: In 15-28 weeks, all parameters had nearly equal r-values. Among all parameters, TCD revealed highest correlation with value of 0.997. In 29-40 weeks, there was considerable difference in r-values. An r-value of 0.982 was noted, when the GA by TCD and LMP was compared, r-value of which is more than the other parameters. The least correlation was seen with BPD, r=0.951. The second most accurate correlation was seen with the FL with r-value of 0.981. Conclusion: TCD is an accurate parameter in estimation of gestational age in second and third trimesters as its values are in close relation with that of GA by LMP. It is also better predictor of the gestational age when compared to other parameters especially in third trimester. © 2017, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

Images from 13 eyes were excluded due to poor image quality leaving 67 for analysis. Relative changes in foveal and parafoveal SRVD and FAZA after correction ranged from -20% to +10%, -3% to +2%, and -20% to +51%, respectively. Image size correction in measurements of foveal SRVD and FAZA was greater than 5% in 51% and 74% of eyes, respectively. In contrast, 100% of eyes had less than 5% correction in measurements of parafoveal SRVD. CONCLUSIONS. Ocular biometry should be performed with OCTA to correct image magnification error induced by axial length variation. We advise caution when interpreting interocular and interindividual comparisons of SRVD and FAZA derived from OCTA without image size correction. © 2017 The Authors.","Axial length; Bennett formula; Foveal avascular zone; Littman formula; Magnification error; Normative database; OCTA; Optical coherence tomography angiography; Retina; Retinal disease; Superficial vessel plexus","adult; aged; Article; axial length variation; biometry; blood vessel density; blood vessel parameters; eye fundus; eye refraction; female; foveal avascular zone area; human; image quality; image segmentation; imaging software; male; mathematical analysis; middle aged; normal human; optical coherence tomography angiography; priority journal; refraction error; retina blood vessel; retina fovea; visual acuity; adolescent; capillary; cytology; eye axis length; fluorescence angiography; optical coherence tomography; procedures; reproducibility; retina blood vessel; retina macula lutea; vascularization; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Axial Length, Eye; Capillaries; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Fovea Centralis; Fundus Oculi; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Macula Lutea; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Retinal Vessels; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Young Adult"

The purpose of this article is to evaluate optic nerve head (ONH) characteristics in an ethnically diverse cohort of young U.S. adults. METHODS. In this study, 409 myopes and 206 nonmyopes (median age 22 years) completed measures including biometry and spectral domain optical coherence tomography from enface (ovality and torsion) and cross-sectional (tilt and crescent width) scans. Associated factors were evaluated using multivariable models. RESULTS. In myopic versus nonmyopic right eyes, median tilt (6.0° vs. 2.4°; P < 0.0001) and frequency of crescents (49% vs. 10%; P < 0.0001) were higher in myopes. Right eyes with crescents had higher median tilts (8.8° [myopic], 9.0° [nonmyopic]) than those without crescent (2.5° [myopic], 2.1° [nonmyopic]), irrespective of refractive group (both P < 0.0001). Torsion was similar between groups, with a slight difference in ovality (0.89 vs. 0.91; P < 0.03). Data in the left eyes were similar, and modeling was done only for the right myopic eyes. Multivariable models showed that an increased tilt was associated with ethnicity (P < 0.001), the presence of crescent (P < 0.001), and smaller ONH diameter (P < 0.0031), with interactions between ethnicity and crescent (P = 0.002). Specifically, ONH tilt was significantly higher in Asian eyes without crescent (P < 0.0001 for all comparisons), and crescent width was associated with increased tilt in non-Asian eyes (P < 0.02). Crescent width was associated with ethnicity (greatest in Asians) and disc tilt. Interactions were observed between tilt and ethnicity, whereby tilt had a greater effect on crescent width in non-Asian eyes, and crescent width was associated with increased tilt in non-Asian eyes. CONCLUSIONS. The data clarify the influence of ethnicity and myopia on ONH characteristics in young adults and may inform future studies of biomechanical properties or of retinal pathology of the myopic eye. © 2017 The Authors.","Myopia; Optic nerve head; Optical coherence tomography","adult; Article; biometry; controlled study; crescent; disc ovality; disc torsion; disease association; ethnicity; eye axis length; female; human; image quality; intraocular pressure; major clinical study; male; myopia; optic nerve tilt; priority journal; spectral domain optical coherence tomography; visual system parameters; young adult; abnormalities; case control study; cross-sectional study; middle aged; myopia; optic disk; optic nerve disease; optical coherence tomography; pathology; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myopia; Optic Disk; Optic Nerve Diseases; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Young Adult"

Topolyzer was often used for the measurement of Q value, and recently Topcon KR-1W and iTrace were applied in ophthalmology. However, whether the measured values are interchangeable is unclear. Objective: This study was to assess the difference and consistency of corneal Q values measured by Topcon KR-1W, iTrace and Topolyzer. Methods: Corneal Q values were measured on 100 right eyes of 100 healthy subjects under the approval of Ethic Committee of the Sixth Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University and informed consent of each subject from November to December in 2014 with Topcon KR-1W, iTrace and Topolyzer. Three valid measurements were obtained for each device, and the average values from each device were calculated. The difference of the outcomes among the instruments was compared by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the consistency among the outcomes from different apparatus was analyzed by Bland-Altman plots. Results: The mean corneal Q values were -0.184±0.112, -0.117±0.167 and -0.269±0.117 from Topcon KR-1W, iTrace and Topolyzer, respectively, with a significant difference among them (P<0.001). The measured Q value by Topcon KR-1W was 0.085±0.010 larger than that by Topolyzer, and the Q values by iTrace was 0.152±0.014 larger than that by Topolyzer, while the Q values obtained by Topcon KR-1W was 0.067±0.016 smaller than that by iTrace (all at P<0.05). The 95% confidence interval of the values between Topcon KR-1W and iTrace, Topcon KR-1W and Topolyzer, iTrace and Topolyzer were -0.106 to -0.028, 0.060 to 0.109 and 0.118 to 0.186, respectively. Bland-Altman plots showed that 6%, 6% and 5% values were outside of 95% agreement of limit (LoA) between Topcon KR-1W and iTrace, iTrace and Topolyzer or KR-1W and Topolyzer, respectively, with the maximal differences of 0.28, 0.43 and 0.38. Conclusions: Corneal Q values measured by Topcon KR-1W and iTrace are larger than those measured by Topolyzer. Due to the poor agreements among the corneal Q values by the 3 kinds of devices, they are not interchangeable in clinical applications for the measurement of corneal Q value.

It requires, as input, a feature on an interval or ratio scale, and which is reasonably normally distributed, and it can only be calculated if each subject is tested on 2 or more occasions. For a biometric system, with multiple features available for selection, the ICC can be used to measure the relative stability of each feature. We show, for 14 distinct data sets (1 synthetic, 8 eye-movementrelated, 2 gait-related, and 2 face-recognition-related, and one brain-structure-related), that selecting the most stable features, based on the ICC, resulted in the best biometric performance generally. Analyses based on using only the most stable features produced superior Rank-1-Identification Rate (Rank-1-IR) performance in 12 of 14 databases (p = 0.0065, onetailed), when compared to other sets of features, including the set of all features. For Equal Error Rate (EER), using a subset of only high-ICC features also produced superior performance in 12 of 14 databases (p = 0. 0065, one-tailed). In general, then, for our databases, prescreening potential biometric features, and choosing only highly reliable features yields better performance than choosing lower ICC features or than choosing all features combined. We also determined that, as the ICC of a group of features increases, the median of the genuine similarity score distribution increases and the spread of this distribution decreases. There was no statistically significant similar relationships for the impostor distributions. We believe that the ICC will find many uses in biometric research. In case of the eye movement-driven biometrics, the use of reliable features, as measured by ICC, allowed to us achieve the authentication performance with EER = 2.01%, which was not possible before. © 2017 Friedman et al.

In temperate waters, metabolic and biochemical responses may be governed by physiological changes driven by seasonal factors. Gathering baseline information on the mechanisms underlying seasonal acclimation patterns is therefore a critical step towards the understanding of the physiological responses of biological indicators. In poikilothermic metazoans, the production of regulatory metabolic enzymes can be used as tools for deciphering the acclimation potential. The aim of this study was to characterize the natural seasonal variability in biometric traits and enzymatic biomarkers over a 12-month period in the sea anemone, Anemonia sulcata (Anthozoa, Cnidaria), from two areas with different environmental and anthropic impacts. Seasonality and site factors affected enzymatic kinetics at tentacle levels, while seasonality, site and biometrical characteristics modulated the same enzymes in the body column of A. sulcata. The results showed a decrease in enzymatic activity in summer and an increased synthesis of enzymes in the late fall and winter months. The interaction between biometric features and temperature appeared significant for mesolittoral sea anemones but not for infralittoral specimens. This study showed seasonal patterns of variations of biochemical responses in A. sulcata, suggesting that this species, an abundant member of shallow rocky bottom communities in temperate European seas, may represent a sensitive bio-indicator organism worth considering for further ecological studies on climate change as well as for environmental monitoring programs. © 2017, Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Anemonia sulcata; Biometry; Biondicator; Hydrolase; Peroxidase; Seasonal variation; Thermal stress","Actiniaria; Anemonia sulcata; Anthozoa; Cnidaria; Metazoa"

Methods: A retrospective analysis of sEFW performed within 3 days of delivery in a tertiary medical center in Israel between July 2007 and December 2014 was conducted. Breech-presenting singleton fetuses were matched by sex and birth weight to vertex-presenting fetuses. sEFW was calculated using 21 formulas. Systematic and random errors, proportion of estimates (POE) within 10% of actual birth weight, and reliability analysis were used to compare sonographic accuracy. The best performing formula was determined by Euclidean distance. Results: Both groups contained 274 fetuses. Systematic error was lower for breech fetuses when compared with control fetuses in 17 of 21 formulas; there was no significant difference in random error between the breech and vertex groups. For vertex fetuses, Euclidean distance was smaller in 17 of 21 formulas, and POE within 10% of birth weight was higher in most formulas. Cronbach α value was higher for vertex fetuses than for breech fetuses in all formulas. The formulas of Combs et al. and Hadlock et al. were highest ranking for breech-presenting fetuses.

But Gould’s hierarchical theory was his second attempt to supply a theoretical framework for macroevolutionary studies—and one he did not inaugurate until the mid-1970s. In this paper, I examine Gould’s first attempt: a proposed fusion of theoretical morphology, multivariate biometry and the experimental study of adaptation in fossils. This early “macroevolutionary synthesis” was predicated on the notion that parallelism and convergence dominate the history of higher taxa, and moreover, that they can be explained in terms of adaptation leading to mechanical improvement. In this paper, I explore the origins and contents of Gould’s first macroevolutionary synthesis, as well as the reasons for its downfall. In addition, I consider how various developments during the mid-1970s led Gould to identify hierarchy and constraint as the leading themes of macroevolutionary studies—and adaptation as a macroevolutionary red herring. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Adaptation; Macroevolution; Paleontology; Progress; Stephen Jay Gould",

Setting Singapore National Eye Center, Singapore, Singapore. Design Retrospective case series. Methods Patients with PACS or PAC (with corrected distance visual acuity <20/40) who had uneventful phacoemulsification were recruited. Patients were excluded if they were on IOP-lowering medications within 6 months preoperatively and postoperatively. Preoperative gonioscopy, A-scan biometry, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and automated refraction were reviewed. Factors related to the percentage of and absolute IOP change were assessed using multiple linear regression analyses after adjusting for age, sex, and diagnosis. Results The study evaluated 85 patients (85 eyes; 52 PACS, 33 PAC) after 7 eyes (1 PACS, 6 PAC) were excluded because of poor quality imaging. Overall, IOP decreased by 19.9% from the preoperative mean of 16.1 mm Hg ± 3.1 (SD) to 12.9 ± 2.7 mm Hg. The IOP change between the PACS group (−3.3 ± 2.8 mm Hg; −20.6%) and the PAC group (−3.2 ± 4.7 mm Hg; −19.6%) was similar (P >.05). In multiple linear regression analyses, a higher preoperative IOP (β = 0.68, P <.001) and fewer clock hours of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) (β = −0.30, P =.03) predicted a greater absolute change in and percentage of reduction in IOP, respectively. Conclusions The mean IOP reduction 6 months after phacoemulsification was 20%.

Design A case report. Setting Private assisted reproduction unit. Patient(s) A 36-year-old patient who conceived her first pregnancy through IVF and became infected with Zika virus at 10 weeks’ gestation in Venezuela. Intervention(s) In vitro fertilization with fresh ET. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging Zika diagnostic methods. Main Outcome Measure(s) Zika virus detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in maternal plasma, PCR in amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood. Ultrasonography findings of anatomic abnormalities. Result(s) Zika infection was confirmed at 10 weeks’ gestation by real-time PCR; ultrasound results appeared normal. At 19 weeks’ gestation, an ultrasound revealed biometry on three SDs below the means for all parameters but with no apparent anatomic abnormality. Zika virus was positive in maternal urine and amniotic fluid by PCR at 19 weeks’ gestation. Ultrasound at 21 weeks + 4 days of gestation showed fetal cerebellar hypoplasia with ventricular dysmorphia, particularly marked on the left, consistent with microcephaly and ventriculomegaly. Because of the poor prognosis, pregnancy was interrupted at 24 weeks’ gestation, in France. The PCR in umbilical cord blood taken in this procedure was positive for Zika virus. Conclusion(s) Initial ultrasound findings in pregnancy may not be informative. Only at 21 weeks + 4 days of gestation did an ultrasound reveal fetal microcephaly and ventriculomegaly.

Unfortunately, growth restriction often is not detected antenatally. The last weeks of pregnancy are critical for preventing stillbirth among babies with FGR because there is a pronounced increase in stillbirths among growth-restricted fetuses after 37 weeks of pregnancy. Here we present a protocol (V.1, 23 May 2016) for the RATIO37 trial, which evaluates an integrated strategy for accurately selecting at-risk fetuses for delivery at term. The protocol is based on the combination of fetal biometry and cerebroplacental ratio (CPR). The primary objective is to reduce stillbirth rates. The secondary aims are to detect low birth weights and adverse perinatal outcomes. Methods and analysis The study is designed as multicentre (Spain, Chile, Mexico,Czech Republic and Israel), open-label, randomised trial with parallel groups. Singleton pregnancies will be invited to participate after routine second-trimester ultrasound scan (19 +0-22 +6 weeks of gestation), and participants will be randomly allocated to receive revealed or concealed CPR evaluation. Then, a routine ultrasound and Doppler scan will be performed at 36 +0-37 +6 weeks. Sociodemographic and clinical data will be collected at enrolment. Ultrasound and Doppler variables will be recorded at 36 +0-37 +6 weeks of pregnancy. Perinatal outcomes will be recorded after delivery. Univariate (with estimated effect size and its 95% CI) and multivariate (mixed-effects logistic regression) comparisons between groups will be performed. Ethics and dissemination The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice. This study was accepted by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Hospital Clinic Barcelona on 23May 2016. Subsequent approval by individual ethical committees and competent authorities was granted.

Low cerebroplacental ratio, regardless of the fetal size, is independently associated with the need for operative delivery for presumed fetal compromise and with neonatal unit admission at term. Objective The main aim of this study was to evaluate whether the cerebroplacental ratio at term is a marker of reduced fetal growth rate. The secondary aim was to investigate the relationship between a low cerebroplacental ratio at term, reduced fetal growth velocity, and adverse pregnancy outcome. Study Design This was a retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies in a tertiary referral center. The abdominal circumference was measured at 20–24 weeks’ gestation and both abdominal circumference and fetal Dopplers recorded at or beyond 35 weeks, within 2 weeks of delivery. Abdominal circumference and birthweight values were converted into Z scores and centiles, respectively, and fetal Doppler parameters into multiples of median, adjusting for gestational age. Abdominal circumference growth velocity was quantified using the difference in the abdominal circumference Z score, comparing the scan at or beyond 35 weeks with the scan at 20–24 weeks. Both univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between low cerebroplacental ratio and the low abdominal circumference growth velocity (in the lowest decile) and to identify and adjust for potential confounders. As a sensitivity analysis, we refitted the model excluding the data on pregnancies with small-for-gestational-age neonates. Results The study included 7944 pregnancies. Low cerebroplacental ratio multiples of median was significantly associated with both low abdominal circumference growth velocity (adjusted odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.71–2.57, P <0.001) and small for gestational age (adjusted odds ratio, 3.60; 95% confidence interval, 3.04–4.25, P < .001). After the exclusion of pregnancies resulting in small-for-gestational-age neonates, a low cerebroplacental ratio multiples of the median remained significantly associated with both low abdominal circumference growth velocity (adjusted odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–2.30, P < .001) and birthweight centile (adjusted odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.998–0.995, P < .001). The need for operative delivery for fetal compromise was significantly associated with a low cerebroplacental ratio (adjusted odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–1.78, P = .006), even after adjusting for both the umbilical artery pulsatility index multiples of the median and middle cerebral artery pulsatility index multiples of median. The results were similar, even after the exclusion of pregnancies resulting in small-for-gestational-age neonates (adjusted odds ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.84, P = .018). Low cerebroplacental ratio multiples of the median remained significantly associated with the risk of operative delivery for presumed fetal compromise (P < .001), even after adjusting for the known antenatal and intrapartum risk factors. These associations persisted, even after the exclusion of small-for-gestational-age births. In appropriate-for-gestational-age–sized fetuses, abdominal circumference growth velocity was significantly lower in those with a low cerebroplacental ratio multiples of the median than in those with normal cerebroplacental ratio multiples of the median (P < .001). Conclusion The cerebroplacental ratio is a marker of impaired fetal growth velocity and adverse pregnancy outcome, even in fetuses whose size is considered appropriate using conventional biometry. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","abdominal circumference; adverse pregnancy outcome; birthweight; cerebroplacental ratio; fetal growth restriction; growth velocity; impaired; lowest decile; second trimester; small for gestational age; third trimester","abdominal circumference; adult; adverse outcome; Article; birth weight; cerebroplacental ratio; cohort analysis; female; fetal Doppler; fetoplacental unit; fetus; fetus growth; gestation period; growth rate; human; instrumental delivery; major clinical study; middle cerebral artery; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; pulsatility index; retrospective study; risk assessment; small for date infant; umbilical artery"

This study aimed to identify the most efficient method to estimate the repeatability coefficient (r) and predict the minimum number of measurements needed for a more accurate evaluation of soursop (Annona muricata L.) genotypes based on fruit yield. Sixteen measurements of fruit yield from 71 soursop genotypes were carried out between 2000 and 2016. In order to estimate r with the best accuracy, four procedures were used: analysis of variance, principal component analysis based on the correlation matrix, principal component analysis based on the phenotypic variance and covariance matrix, and structural analysis based on the correlation matrix. The minimum number of measurements needed to predict the actual value of individuals was estimated. Principal component analysis using the phenotypic variance and covariance matrix provided the most accurate estimates of both r and the number of measurements required for accurate evaluation of fruit yield in soursop.

Previous studies have found a positive association between myopia, education, and near activities, while others have noted a negative association with outdoor exposure. This study reports refractive error and biometry in a founder population of European ancestry, the Hutterites, and discusses risk factors contributing to myopia. Methods: Cross-sectional study, including complete eye exams with retinoscopy and biometry. Results: 939 study participants, ages 6 to 89, were examined. Females were significantly more myopic than males (SE −0.87 ± 2.07 and −0.40 ± 1.49 in females and males, respectively, p < 0.0001). Males had significantly longer axial lengths. Females had steeper corneas. This is the first epidemiological report of refractive error among the Hutterites. Discussion: As a genetically isolated population with a communal lifestyle, the Hutterites present a unique opportunity to study risk factors for myopia. Hutterite females are more myopic than males, a finding which has only been reported in a few other populations. Hutterite children complete compulsory education through the 8th grade, after which women and men assume gender-specific occupational tasks. Men often work outside on the farm, while women engage in more domestic activities inside. These occupational differences likely contribute to the increased myopia comparing females to males, and their uniform lifestyle reduces the impact of potential confounding factors, such as education and income. Conclusions: The Hutterites are more myopic than most other North American and European populations. Greater time spent doing near work and less time spent outdoors likely explain the increased myopia comparing females to males. © 2017 Taylor & Francis","Biometry; myopia; near work; outdoor exposure; pediatric ophthalmology; refractive error",

Difficulties arise due to the small size and fragility of the infants’ physical structures and the effects of rapid physical growth. We review the literature for suitable biometrics and investigate the footprint; asking (a) if there is a time frame shortly after birth when the friction ridge skin pattern of a newborn can be reliably captured; and (b) if the footprint crease pattern is a suitable newborn and infant biometric. For (a), we were unable to confirm the existence of such a time frame. For (b), we performed automatic verification experiments on a small test set of 20 pairs of crease patterns, and then a larger test set, achieving EERs of 22.22% and 46.39%, respectively. The comparison of two dizygotic twins did not show any noteworthy performance difference.

Fusion systems with predefined constant weight values for each biometry becomes much popular. Among biometrics, face modality is one of the most common traits that is used in such fusion system. However, face verification suffers from many challenging difficulties, one of which is facial makeup. Recently, it has been shown that the accuracy of face verification can be impacted by the presence of facial makeup. And as such, the verification result of a multimodal fusion system with constant weight value for each biometry can be degraded by facial cosmetics. In this work, we propose a method of integrating facial makeup detection into the fusion system to increase performance. In our investigated scenario, score level fusion of face, fingerprint and iris verification are performed, while the weight value of each trait changes dynamically according to the level of makeup classification of test facial image. So far, this is the first work taking into account the facial makeup within a multimodal biometric verification system. Experiments on 1600 different subjects reveal that our proposed method can help in increasing the overall performance of fusion system than without using the facial makeup information. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Biometrics; Biometric traits; Face Verification; Iris verification; Multi-modal biometrics; Multi-modal fusion; Score-level fusion; User verification; Verification results; Face recognition"

Methods: This prospective non-randomized case-control study compared patients with combined phacovitrectomy with or without intraocular gas tamponade to cataract surgery-only. The main outcome measure was the IOL power prediction error (PE). Secondary outcome measures were spherical equivalent, anterior chamber depth (ACD), and axial length. Results: Thirty-four patients with epiretinal membranes and 18 patients with cataract only were enrolled. There were no statistically significant (P>0.05) differences of IOL power PE or postoperative ACDs (P=0.952-1.00). Nevertheless, IOL power PE indicated a myopic shift in cases with phacovitrectomy independent of gas tamponade (P=1.00). No statistically significant between-group differences between secondary outcome measures were observed. Conclusion: A myopic shift after phacovitrectomy seems to be independent of the use of intraocular gas tamponade.

Lipid content of diet was replaced by oxidized fish oil (OFO) in 0, 50, and 100%. Green tea extract (GTE) was added to diet in three levels, 0, 5, and 100 mg/kg giving a total of nine experimental diets. Two hundred and seventy sturgeon hybrid of Sterlet (Huso huso ♀ × Acipenser ruthenus ♂) with initial weight of 212.6 ± 0.7 g after 2 weeks adaptation randomly divided in 27 fiberglass tanks with 700 L volume. Fish were fed satiated three times daily. After 6 weeks, biometry was done to evaluate growth performance and blood samples were taken for biochemical analysis. The result showed that feeding with oxidized oil had no effects on growth. However, in fish fed GTE, growth indices improved slightly. Feeding with OFO reduced serum total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and low-density lipoprotein, while increased high density lipoprotein. Dietary GTE moderated the effects of OFO on lipid metabolism. Feeding with the OFO increased activity of serum superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde contents. In fish received both OFO and GTE, reduced activity of serum antioxidant enzymes and malondialdehyde content was recorded in compare to fish fed only OFO. According to the result of the present study, it can be argued that feeding of sturgeon hybrid of Sterlet with OFO has negative effects on lipid metabolism and antioxidant status, whereas GTE dosages used in this study have protective effects on fish from the adverse effects of oxidized oil. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Green tea; Growth; Oxidative stress; Oxidized oil; Sturgeon hybrid",

Alcohol-induced liver damage is characterized by polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) infiltration, which can be represented in the peripheral blood by altered trafficking and activation profiles. Objective: To evaluate the PMN trafficking and activation immunophenotypic profiles in people with a binge drinking pattern. Methods: People with binge drinking (n = 18, 8 females) or at low risk (n = 16, 13 females) based on their AUDIT and HEPCA scores were studied. Hematic biometry and liver enzyme tests were conducted. Peripheral blood leukocytes were stained for CCR5, CCR4, and CXCR4 (trafficking) and CD69 and CD127 (activation). PMNs and monocytes were analyzed by FACS. The data were analyzed using the T-test and Mann–Whitney’s U-test for contrasts and principal component and Fuzzy C means analyses for clustering, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results: Compared to the low-risk group, the binge group showed higher CCR5 expression on PMNs, decreases in the CD69 percentage and positive PMNs per microliter, and decreased CXCR4 expression on monocytes. Six immunophenotypical clusters were identified, all of which were distributed following the CCR5 and CXCR4 main vectors. Conclusion: Young adult binge drinkers have differential PMN trafficking and activation immunophenotypes, which could be related to the initial onset of alcoholic liver disease and a systemic inflammatory state in response to their alcohol consumption pattern. These findings could lead to the future development of an early diagnostic tool. © 2017 Taylor & Francis","binge drinking; CCR5; immunophenotypes; Liver damage; principal component analysis",

The study further examined the predictive value of second-trimester amniotic fluid CRH and UCN for fetal growth and neonatal birth outcome. The amniocentesis served as a naturalistic stressor, during which maternal state anxiety and salivary cortisol was measured repeatedly and an aliquot of amniotic fluid was collected. The pregnant women additionally completed a questionnaire on chronic social overload. Fetal growth parameters were obtained at amniocentesis using fetal ultrasound biometry and at birth from medical records. The statistical analyzes revealed that the acute maternal psychobiological stress response was unassociated with the amniotic fluid peptides, but that maternal chronic overload and amniotic CRH were positively correlated. Moreover, amniotic CRH was negatively associated with fetal size at amniocentesis and positively with growth in size from amniocentesis to birth. Hardly any studies have previously explored whether acute maternal psychological stress influences fetoplacental CRH or UCN levels significantly. Our findings suggest that (i) chronic, but not acute maternal stress may affect fetoplacental CRH secretion and that (ii) CRH is complexly involved in fetal growth processes as previously shown in animals. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CRH; fetal growth; Prenatal stress; psychobiological stress response; salivary cortisol; urocortin",

Methods: This study was performed on 91 eyes of 91 patients who underwent uneventful cataract surgery. Ocular biometry values were measured using the IOL Master 500, and intraocular lens (IOL) power was calculated using the Haigis, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, and SRK/T formulas. We calculated the expected difference (ED) of each 3rd generation formula from the Haigis formula by subtracting the predicted refraction of the Haigis formula from the predicted refraction of each 3rd generation formula. Post-operative anterior chamber depth (ACD) was measured at 1 month after surgery using the IOL master. We calculated errors of each formula by subtracting predicted from manifest refraction at post-operative 1 month. Correlation analysis was performed between ocular biometry values, formula expectation values, formula errors and absolute formula errors. Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that preoperative ACD was the only significant factor for ED prediction in all of the 3rd generation formulas. For mean errors, axial length and post-operative 1-month change of ACD (delta ACD) correlated significantly with the errors in all 3rd generation formulas, but not with errors of the Haigis formula. Median absolute error (MedAE) of the formulas were 0.40 D for the Hoffer Q formula, 0.37 D for the Holladay formula, 0.34 D for the SRK/T formula, and 0.41 D for the Haigis formula. The MAE of the formulas were 0.50 ± 0.47 D for the Hoffer Q formula, 0.50 ± 0.50 D for the Holladay formula, 0.47 ± 0.51 D for the SRK/T formula, and 0.50 ± 0.47 D for the Haigis formula. Conclusion: Regarding ED between the third generation and Haigis formulas, preoperative ACD demonstrated the greatest influence. Calculating mean absolute errors of the formulas, all IOL formulas showed excellent and comparable accuracy. Post-operative change (delta) of ACD correlated significantly with errors of third generation formulas according to simulated ACD. © 2017 The Author(s).","Anterior chamber depth; IOL formula; Ocular biometry",

Design Cross-sectional study. Methods Subjects diagnosed with MFS by Ghent 2 nosology were included for analysis. Subjects were divided into “adults” (≥16 years of age) and “children” (5–15 years of age). Biometric data included values for refractive error, axial length (AL), corneal curvature, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, and central corneal thickness. Results Of the 117 subjects evaluated, 74 (35 adults, 32 children, and 7 children &lt;5 years of age) had a definite diagnosis of MFS and were included in the study. The AL was longer (25.25 ± 0.32 mm vs 24.24 ± 0.33 mm, P = .03) and the lens was thicker (3.94 ± 0.09 mm vs 3.62 ± 0.10 mm, P = .03) in adults. Both groups had flat corneas (average keratometry [Kmed] of 41.59 ± 0.35 diopters [D] in adults vs 40.89 ± 0.36 D in children, P = .17). A negative correlation was found between AL and Kmed (−0.33, P &lt; .001). The corneas of patients with MFS with ectopia lentis (EL) were significantly flatter and with higher degree of corneal astigmatism compared to patients without EL (Kmed of 40.68 ± 0.31 D vs 41.75 ± 0.28 D, P &lt; .01 and corneal astigmatism of 1.68 ± 0.16 D vs 1.13 ± 0.14 D, P = .01). Conclusions Children with established MFS have flat corneas at least to the same degree as adults. Corneas of patients with MFS with EL are flatter and have a higher degree of corneal astigmatism. We strongly suggest that corneal parameters should be measured if MFS is suspected, especially in children that may not yet have developed EL. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,"adolescent; biometry; child; complication; cornea; Corneal Diseases; cross-sectional study; eye axis length; eye refraction; female; human; Illinois; incidence; keratometry; male; Marfan syndrome; organization; pathology; physiology; preschool child; procedures; visual acuity; Adolescent; Axial Length, Eye; Biometry; Chicago; Child; Child, Preschool; Congresses as Topic; Cornea; Corneal Diseases; Corneal Topography; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Marfan Syndrome; Refraction, Ocular; Visual Acuity"

This could be particularly useful for researchers that do not have access to original keratoconic data. Methods: The Scheimpflug tomography, ocular biometry and wavefront of 145 keratoconic right eyes were collected. These data were processed using principal component analysis for parameter reduction, followed by a multivariate Gaussian fit that produces a stochastic model for keratoconus (SyntEyes KTC). The output of this model is filtered to remove the occasional incorrect topography patterns by either an automatic or manual procedure. Finally, the output of this keratoconus model is matched to that of the original model for normal eyes using the non-corneal biometry to obtain a description of keratoconus development. Results: The synthetic data generated by the model were found to be significantly equal to the original data (non-parametric Mann–Whitney equivalence test; 145/154 passed). The variability of the synthetic data, however, was often significantly less than that of the original data, especially for the higher order Zernike terms of corneal elevation (non-parametric Levene test; p < 0.05/154). These results remained generally the same after applying either filter procedure to remove the synthetic eyes with incorrect topographies. Interpolation between matched pairs of normal and keratoconic SyntEyes appears to provide an adequate model for keratoconus progression. Conclusion: The synthetic data provided by the proposed keratoconus model closely resembles actual clinical data and may be used for a range of research applications when (sufficient) real data is not available. © 2017 The Authors Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics © 2017 The College of Optometrists","keratoconus; ocular biometry; statistical eye model",

Design Observational case series. Participants The study included 190 eyes of 95 participants with bilateral high myopia from the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center–Brien Holden Vision Institute High Myopia Cohort Study, with spherical power ≤−6.00 diopters (D) in both eyes. Methods The participants underwent best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundus photography, cycloplegic refraction, and ocular biometry. Posterior staphyloma was identified with 3D MRI, and ocular shapes were categorized into spheroidal, ellipsoidal, conical, nasally distorted, temporally distorted, and barrel shapes according to the inferior view from T2-weighted 3D MRI (Achieva 3.0T; Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands). Myopic maculopathy was graded as C0 to C4 according to the International Photographic Classification and Grading System using fundus photography. The statistical significance of the differences in distribution of myopic maculopathy and BCVA in eyes with different ocular shapes was determined using Pearson's chi-square tests. Main Outcome Measures Distributions of myopic maculopathy and BCVA in relation to different eye shapes. Results The mean spherical equivalent and axial length were −11.74±4.10 D and 28.18±1.73 mm in the right eyes, respectively. The same ocular shapes were observed in both eyes in 69 participants (72.6%). The predominant shape was spheroidal (53.7%), followed by nasally distorted and conical types (both 14.7%). C2 and above myopic maculopathy was observed in all barrel-shaped eyes, in 75% temporally distorted eyes, and in 71.4% nasally distorted and conical eyes. In eyes with posterior staphyloma (n = 22), 18 (81.8%) had C2 and above myopic maculopathy compared with 40 eyes (54.8%) without posterior staphyloma (n = 73). Eyes with temporal and nasal distortion, and eyes with staphyloma were more likely to have BCVA <20/40. Conclusions Not all highly myopic eyes are deformed. Spheroid was the predominant ocular shape in this series of young patients with high myopia bilaterally. Barrel-shaped and temporally distorted eyes present significant myopic maculopathy, whereas eyes with posterior staphyloma display more severe chorioretinal atrophy. Eyes of more deformed shapes tend to have more severe myopic maculopathy and worse BCVA. © 2017 American Academy of Ophthalmology",,"adolescent; adult; aged; Article; best corrected visual acuity; biometry; child; controlled study; eye fundus; eye photography; eye shape; female; high myopia; human; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; observational study; priority journal; retina maculopathy; three dimensional imaging; visual system parameters; complication; diagnostic imaging; eye; eye refraction; follow up; Myopia, Degenerative; Netherlands; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; optical coherence tomography; organization; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; Retinal Diseases; three dimensional imaging; visual acuity; Academies and Institutes; Adult; Eye; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Myopia, Degenerative; Netherlands; Refraction, Ocular; Reproducibility of Results; Retinal Diseases; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity"

Using fetal biometric charts customized for obstetrical and parental characteristics may facilitate an accurate assessment of fetal growth. Objective The objective of the study was to construct reference charts for the gestation of fetal biometric parameters stratified by chorionicity and customized for obstetrical and parental characteristics. Study Design Fetal biometric measurements obtained from serial ultrasound examinations in uncomplicated twin pregnancies delivering after 36 weeks of gestation were collected by 19 Italian fetal medicine units under the auspices of the Società Italiana di Ecografia Ostetrica e Ginecologica. The measurements acquired in each fetus at each examination included biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length. Multilevel linear regression models were used to adjust for the serial ultrasonographic measurements obtained and the clustering of each fetus in twin pregnancy. The impact of maternal and paternal characteristics (height, weight, ethnicity), parity, fetal sex, and mode of conception was also considered. Models for each parameter were stratified by fetal chorionicity and compared with our previously constructed growth curves for singletons. Results The data set included 1781 twin pregnancies (dichorionic, n = 1289; monochorionic diamniotic, n = 492) with 8923 ultrasonographic examinations with a median of 5 (range, 2–8) observations per pregnancy in dichorionic and 6 in (range, 2–11) monochorionic pregnancies. Growth curves of twin pregnancies differed from those of singletons, and differences were more marked in monochorionic twins and during the third trimester. A significant influence of parental characteristics was found. Conclusion Curves of fetal biometric measurements in twins are influenced by parental characteristics. There is a reduction in the growth rate during the third trimester. The reference limits for gestation constructed in this study may provide a useful tool for a more accurate assessment of fetal growth in twin pregnancies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","fetal biometric parameters; fetal growth; fetal growth restriction; parental characteristics; twin pregnancies","abdominal circumference; Article; biometry; biparietal distance; bone growth; female; femur; fetus; fetus growth; gestational age; growth curve; head circumference; human; major clinical study; male; newborn; priority journal; retrospective study; third trimester pregnancy; twin pregnancy; abdomen; adult; body height; body weight; cephalometry; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; fetus development; fetus echography; growth, development and aging; multicenter study; parent; pregnancy; sex difference; Abdomen; Adult; Body Height; Body Weight; Cephalometry; Female; Femur; Fetal Development; Growth Charts; Humans; Parents; Pregnancy; Pregnancy, Twin; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Ultrasonography, Prenatal"

Determining how constructional and energetic demands operate throughout growth is es­sential to understanding fundamental growth rules and trade-offs that define the framework within which new species originate. In organisms producing spiral shells, coiling patterns can inform on the constructional constraints acting throughout development that dictated the diversification of forms within a group. Here, we use Synchrotron radiation X-Ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) reconstructions of eight planktic foraminifera repre­sentative of the major morphotypic groups to determine disparity of coiling patterns by measuring Raupian parameters. The results show that foraminifera are a morphologically highly conservative group, exploiting a limited range of poten­tial coiling patterns. Very similar coiling patterns during early ontogeny, regardless of species, point toward strong constraints in early ontogeny and to common develop­mental processes acting across all morphogroups. Dispersion and lateral displacement of taxa in morphospace are limited to the adult stage. Accretion with low translation down the coiling axis in juveniles may maximize lateral growth and metabolic efficiency in light of costly calcification. Increased translation in the adult stages allows growth to accommo­date new chamber shapes, mediated by changes in aperture location and the site of accretion over ontogeny. These constructional constraints, and the accretion of a small number of discrete chambers, limit the potential for novel forms within the foraminifera compared to other groups of coiling organisms and may explain the repeated evolution of similar morphotypes throughout the evolutionary history of the group. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Foraminifera; biometry; classification; cytology; evolution; foraminifer; genetics; microscopy; phylogeny; procedures; Biological Evolution; Biometry; Foraminifera; Microscopy; Phylogeny"

For roughly the last 20 years, there has been an increasing interest in therapeutic research for rare diseases. Drug research is highly regulated via numerous laws, regulations and ethical conventions that do not offer any waivers for clinical trials in rare diseases. Thus the ethical assessment of the clinical trial application for a rare disease is basically the same as for a common disease. As the ethical standards of clinical research, for example regarding informed consent, are derived from constitutional rights and have been codified in the German drug law, it is no surprise that they cannot depend on the frequency of a disease. A very important aspect of the ethical assessment is the biometric quality with regard to study design, sample size estimation and statistical analysis, as methodologically poor research with humans is per se unethical. Problems with sample size estimations and pilot studies will be addressed in more detail. Pilot studies should be avoided and sample size estimations should not assume overoptimistic effect sizes and should not increase the error probability beyond 5% two-sided. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biometry; Clinical trials; Ethical assessment; Rare diseases",

Still, its accuracy could be improved if full knowledge about the variation of the corneal biomechanical properties was available. In this study, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) speckle statistics are used to infer the organisation of the corneal micro-structure and hence, to analyse its influence on intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements. Methods Fifty-six subjects were recruited for this prospective study. Macro and micro-structural corneal parameters as well as subject age were considered. Macro-structural analysis included the parameters that are associated with the ocular anatomy, such as central corneal thickness (CCT), corneal radius, axial length, anterior chamber depth and white-to-white corneal diameter. Micro-structural parameters which included OCT speckle statistics were related to the internal organisation of the corneal tissue and its physiological changes during lifetime. The corneal speckle obtained from OCT was modelled with the Generalised Gamma (GG) distribution that is characterised with a scale parameter and two shape parameters. Results In macro-structure analysis, only CCT showed a statistically significant correlation with IOP (R2 = 0.25, p<0.001). The scale parameter and the ratio of the shape parameters of GG distribution showed statistically significant correlation with IOP (R2 = 0.19, p<0.001 and R2 = 0.17, p<0.001, respectively). For the studied group, a weak, although significant correlation was found between age and IOP (R2 = 0.053, p = 0.04). Forward stepwise regression showed that CCT and the scale parameter of the Generalised Gamma distribution can be combined in a regression model (R2 = 0.39, p<0.001) to study the role of the corneal structure on IOP. Conclusions We show, for the first time, that corneal micro-structure influences the IOP measurements obtained from noncontact tonometry. OCT speckle statistics can be employed to learn about the corneal micro-structure and hence, to further calibrate the IOP measurements. © 2017 Jesus et al.

This study employed MRI to assess in utero regional brain volume changes in IUGR fetuses compared to controls. Methods: Retrospectively, using MRI images of fetuses at 30–34 weeks gestational age, a total of 8 brain regions—supratentorial brain and cavity, cerebral hemispheres, temporal lobes and cerebellum—were measured for volume in 13 fetuses with IUGR due to placental insufficiency and in 21 controls. Volumes and their ratios were assessed for difference using regression models. Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between two observers. Results: In both groups, all structures increase in absolute volume during that gestation period, and the rate of cerebellar growth is higher compared to that of supratentorial structures. All structures’ absolute volumes were significantly smaller for the IUGR group. Cerebellar to supratentorial ratios were found to be significantly smaller (P < 0.05) for IUGR compared to controls. No other significant ratio differences were found. ICC showed excellent agreement. Conclusions: The cerebellar to supratentorial volume ratio is affected in IUGR fetuses. Additional research is needed to assess this as a radiologic marker in relation to long-term outcome. Key Points: • IUGR is a pathologic fetal condition affecting the brain • IUGR is associated with long-term neurodevelopmental abnormalities; fetal characterization is needed • This study aimed to evaluate regional brain volume differences in IUGR • Cerebellar to supratentorial volume ratios were smaller in IUGR fetuses • This finding may play a role in long-term development of IUGR fetuses. © 2016, European Society of Radiology.","Brain; Cerebellum; Embryonic and fetal development; IUGR; MRI","biometry; brain; case control study; cerebellum; diagnostic imaging; embryology; female; gestational age; human; intrauterine growth retardation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; pregnancy; prenatal diagnosis; procedures; reproducibility; retrospective study; Biometry; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Cerebellum; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Gestational Age; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pregnancy; Prenatal Diagnosis; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies"

Impulsivity, a multidimensional construct robustly linked to drug addiction, has been increasingly examined as an obesity determinant, but with mixed findings. This study sought to clarify relations between three major domains of impulsivity (i.e., impulsive personality traits, discounting of delayed rewards, and behavioral inhibition) in both obesity and food addiction. Based on the association between impulsivity and compulsive drug use, the general hypothesis was that the impulsivity-food addiction relation would be stronger than and responsible for the impulsivity-obesity relation. Using a cross-sectional dimensional design, participants (N = 181; 32% obese) completed a biometric assessment, the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS), the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scales, a Go/NoGo task, and measures of monetary delay discounting. Results revealed significantly higher prevalence of food addiction among obese participants and stronger zero-order associations between impulsivity indices and YFAS compared to obesity. Two aspects of impulsivity were independently significantly associated with food addiction: (a) a composite of Positive and Negative Urgency, reflecting proneness to act impulsively during intense mood states, and (b) steep discounting of delayed rewards. Furthermore, the results supported food addiction as a mediator connecting both urgency and delay discounting with obesity. These findings provide further evidence linking impulsivity to food addiction and obesity, and suggest that food addiction may be a candidate etiological pathway to obesity for individuals exhibiting elevations in these domains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Delay discounting; Food addiction; Impulsivity; Obesity; Urgency","adult; Article; biometry; body composition; body fat; body mass; cross-sectional study; delay discounting; female; food addiction; hip circumference; human; impulsiveness; inhibition (psychology); major clinical study; male; mental disease assessment; neck circumference; obesity; rating scale; sensation seeking; waist circumference; Yale Food Addiction Scale; young adult"

In response, the aim of this study was to evaluate relaxed CM tone in vivo in pre-presbyopic and presbyopic patients using a predictor value (PCM). Methods: Two groups of eyes—40 eyes of 40 healthy volunteers with a mean age of 28.1 ± 5.8 years and 40 eyes of 40 healthy volunteers with a mean age of 56.6 ± 7.3 years—formed the sample for this prospective, observational cross-sectional study. Used to evaluate relaxed CM tone, PCM was calculated as the difference between the change in mean anterior chamber depth (ACD) and lens thickness (LT) before and after cycloplegia, as measured with swept-source optical biometry. Results: The PCM for relaxed CM tone was 0.04 ± 0.04 mm in pre-presbyopic participants, 0.06 ± 0.03 mm in presbyopic ones, and significantly greater in presbyopic patients (p =.018). Conclusion: The statistical significance of PCM between pre-presbyopic and presbyopic eyes might not signify clinical significance, since the difference was close to the repeatability limits for swept-source optical biometry.

Furthermore, it underlies similarly rigid implementation guidelines from the medical biometry perspective, pertaining from the choice of minimum necessary patient numbers to the primary statistical evaluation concept. The latter, however, require the explicit parameterization of clinical endpoints, alongside which efficacy and effectiveness of the drug under investigation will then be tested for the trial at hand. In most settings, the choice of these endpoints directly arises from the clinical rationale of the investigation, but is then complemented with a rather rigid recommendation from the trial statistician's perspective, that is the restriction to only one primary clinical endpoint. The use of several parallel clinical endpoints cannot only end up in inconsistent or even contradictory clinical decision rules, but can also have crucial impact on the overall number of patients necessary in the statistical analysis of the clinical trial under consideration. Although the combination of multiple parallel endpoints may provide a solution in some clinical trial settings, the most effective recommendation can be seen in specifying only one primary clinical endpoint of maximum clinical relevance for the therapeutic intention at hand.",,

Design: Retrospective chart review. Participants: All patients who were diagnosed with AAC in Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between June 2011 and February 2015 were enrolled. Methods: Seventy-two patients who were diagnosed with AAC underwent a detailed ocular examination. The diagnosed mechanism of AAC was confirmed by UBM and ocular biometry. Main Outcome Measures: Primary mechanism responsible for acute angle closure. Results: In 72 patients, the mean age was 62.33 ± 10.4 years, 18 (25%) patients were male and 54 (75%) patients were female. The primary mechanism of AAC was iridolenticular wrapping (crowded-angle (CR) plus anterior lens subluxation (LS)) in 49 eyes (68.1%), pupillary block (PB) in 17 (23.6%) eyes, and plateau iris (PL) in 6 (8.3%) eyes. Thirty (41.7%) out of 72 eyes without previous iridotomy before UBM examination were analyzed. The most common primary mechanism in this group was iridolenticular wrapping (20 eyes, 66.7%). There were seven (23.3%) eyes that had a pupillary block, and only three (10.0%) eyes had plateau iris syndrome as the primary mechanism of AAC. There was a single mechanism in 14 (46.7%) eyes, and there were combined mechanisms in 16 (53.3%) eyes. Conclusions: The most common mechanism contributing to AAC development in this Thai population was iridolenticular wrapping.

We inquired whether oblique astigmatism from these two sources should be expected, theoretically, to have the same or opposite signs across the visual field at various states of accommodation. Methods: Oblique astigmatism was computed across the central visual field for a rotationally-symmetric schematic-eye using optical design software. Accommodative state was varied by altering the apical radius of curvature and separation of the biconvex lens's two aspheric surfaces in a manner consistent with published biometry. Oblique astigmatism was evaluated separately for the whole eye, the cornea, and the isolated lens over a wide range of surface curvatures and asphericity values associated with the accommodating lens. We also computed internal oblique astigmatism by subtracting corneal oblique astigmatism from whole-eye oblique astigmatism. Results: A visual field map of oblique astigmatism for the cornea in the Navarro model follows the classic, textbook description of radially-oriented axes everywhere in the field. Despite large changes in surface properties during accommodation, intrinsic astigmatism of the isolated human lens for collimated light is also radially oriented and nearly independent of accommodation both in theory and in real eyes. However, the magnitude of ocular oblique astigmatism is smaller than that of the cornea alone, indicating partial compensation by the internal optics. This implies internal oblique astigmatism (which includes wavefront propagation from the posterior surface of the cornea to the anterior surface of the lens and intrinsic lens astigmatism) must have tangentially-oriented axes. This non-classical pattern of tangential axes for internal astigmatism was traced to the influence of corneal power on the angles of incidence of rays striking the internal lens. Conclusions: Partial compensation of corneal astigmatism by internal optics is due mainly to the highly converging nature of wavefronts incident upon the lens resulting from corneal refraction. The degree of compensation is quadratically dependent on eccentricity but is expected to diminish as the eye accommodates. Neutralising the cornea by index-matching defeats internal compensation, revealing classical, radially-oriented oblique astigmatism in the isolated lens. © 2017 The Authors Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics © 2017 The College of Optometrists","accommodation; compensation; oblique astigmatism; peripheral vision",

Methods: Consecutive cataract patients were recruited at the Central Hospital of Wuhan between January 2015 and June 2016. Ocular axial length (AL), keratometry values, anterior chamber depth (ACD) and horizontal corneal diameter (white to white [WTW]) of each cataract-affected eye were measured with the IOLMaster device. Results: The study evaluated 3209 eyes of 2821 cataract patients. The mean AL, ACD, and WTW were 24.38 ± 2.47 mm, 3.15 ± 0.48 mm, and 11.63 ± 0.43 mm, respectively. Corneal astigmatism of 0.51-1.00 diopters (D) was the most common range of values (34.96%). A total of 10.56% patients exhibited a corneal astigmatism greater than 2.0 D. The flat and steep keratometry values gradually increased with age. The mean ACD and WTW showed increasing trends as the AL increased (P < 0.001). When the AL was shorter than 26.0 mm, the keratometry decreased as AL increased. The against-the-rule (ATR) astigmatism proportion increased with age and the with-the-rule (WTR) astigmatism proportion decreased with age.

Three sets of keratometry measurements were obtained using the image-guided system to assess the coefficient of variation, the within-subject standard deviation and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). A paired Student t test was used to assess statistical significance between the Verion and the auto-refracto-keratometer. A Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) was obtained for all measurements, and the level of agreement was verified using Bland–Altman plots. Results: The right eyes of 73 patients were evaluated by each platform. The Verion coefficient of variation was 0.3% for the flat and steep keratometry, with the ICC being greater than 0.9 for all parameters measured.

Methods: Haigis-L formula, Koch-Maloney method using Haigis formula, Shammas clinically derived K-value (simulated keratometric value) correction (Shammas c.d.) using Haigis formula, and Shammas post-LASIK (Shammas-PL) formula were used in eyes with myopic LASIK. Constants were derived from the optimized constants in 133 virgin eyes. Refractive outcomes were determined by streak retinoscopy and subjective manifest refraction. Methods and formulas were evaluated by mean error (ME), standard deviation (SD), range of error, mean absolute error (MAE), median absolute error, 95% confidence interval of MAE, and percentage of eyes within ±0.5 diopter (D), ±1.0 D, and ±1.5 D of prediction.

Results: CRT of the treated eyes decreased by 35.33 ± 65.59 μm (range, –222.00–67 μm), while AL increased by 0.008 ± 0.062 mm (range, –0.11–0.18 mm). CRT of the control group decreased by 9.82 ± 65.40 μm (range, –203–182 μm), and AL increased by 0.011 ± 0.129 mm (range, –0.20–0.67 mm). No significant correlation was detected between CRT and AL parameters (rhos=0.026, P=0.882). Conclusions: Anti-VEGF administration has no significant impact on optical biometry-derived AL measurements. © 2017 Taylor & Francis","Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor; axial length; central retinal thickness; IOL Master biometry; macular edema",

A number of 2075 pregnant women who attend the maternity check up in 2013 to 2015 at Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hospital Maternity and Children of Dammam, Saudi Arabia, were involved in this study. The data were recorded from 12th to 40th weeks of gestational age (GA). The BPD was measured using Sony Corporation 1-7-1 Konan Minator-K. On-screen caliper is used to measure the BPD parameter on the frozen image using linear method. The SPSS software version 22.0 was used for analysis, with statistical analysis were performed such as compare means, regression analysis and paired sample t-test. Results show that higher BPD growth rate was found in second trimester (12th to 25th weeks of GA) with 2.90 mm/week compared to third trimester (26th to 40th weeks of GA) with only 1.68 mm/week, proved that the rapid growth of fetus head in second trimester than third trimester. Further analysis on maternal age, number of gravid and gender of the fetus were found no significant impact on the BPD values (p values ≥ 0.05). The BPD value of this study shows no significant difference with the BPD values of USA [1], Norway [2], Australia [3], Zimbabwe [4], India [5], China [6] and Malaysia [7]. Thus, this new BPD values are highly recommended to be used by the medical practitioner as the reference range of fetus biometry for Saudi Arabia population, in regards to provide a better healthcare and well being of the maternal and fetuses. © 2016 IEEE.","BPD; fetus Biometry; Saudi Arabia","Regression analysis; Software testing; Biparietal diameters; fetus Biometry; Gestational age; Medical practitioner; Paired-sample t-test; Reference range; Saudi Arabia; Sony Corporation; Control systems"

Setting Private practice, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA. Design Retrospective consecutive case series. Methods Eyes with an axial length (AL) greater than 25.0 mm had cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation. For each eye, the 1-center Wang-Koch AL-optimized Holladay 1 formula was used to select an IOL targeting emmetropia. Residual refractive error was predicted preoperatively using the SRK/T, Holladay 1 and 2, Barrett Universal II, and Hill-RBF formulas and intraoperatively using wavefront aberrometry. The postoperative refraction was compared with the preoperative and intraoperative predictions. Results The study comprised 37 patients (51 eyes). The mean numerical errors ± standard error associated with using the SRK/T, Holladay 1, AL-optimized Holladay 1, Holladay 2, Barrett Universal II, and Hill-RBF formulas and intraoperative wavefront aberrometry were 0.20 ± 0.06 diopters (D), 0.33 ± 0.06 D, −0.02 ± 0.06 D, 0.24 ± 0.06 D, 0.19 ± 0.06 D, 0.22 ± 0.06 D, and 0.056 ± 0.06 D, respectively (P <.001). The proportion of patients within ±0.5 D of the predicted error was 74.5%, 62.8%, 82.4%, 79.1%, 73.9%, 76.7%, and 80.4%, respectively (P =.090).

Study design: Pregnant women presenting between 18and 22 weeks for routine anatomical survey and biometric measurements were recruited. Six volumes of fetal anatomic regions were obtained and archived for later reconstruction, along with three volumes of extra-fetal structures (placenta, cervix, amniotic fluid). The 2D standard fetal images were then obtained. Offline reconstruction of 3D volumes was performed for comparative analysis (2D vs 3D). Subsequently, 3D volumes were reconstructed to mirror traditional 2D and allow biometric comparison between the two techniques. Data of 98 patients were analyzed. Results: Complete visualization of vital anatomic structures was seen ≥85% of the time with 3D ultrasound. The 3D imaging improved the assessment of the four heart chambers (P=0.003), thoracic spine (P=0.008) and lumbar spine (P=0.012) views. The 2D imaging was superior for the fetal head, placenta and upper limbs. Conditional probabilities were used to assess the clinical value of 3D when standard 2D views were incomplete (mean 0.8830; 95% confidence interval 0.8059 to 0.9320). Overall diagnostic accuracy of 3D ultrasound is not superior for all fetal anatomic structures. Fetal biometric measurements assessed by both techniques demonstrated substantial to excellent agreement. Conclusion: The use of 3D imaging as a primary screening tool is limited and may be best utilized as a second-stage test.

Conversely, sea surface temperatures (SST) and sea ice seasonal dynamics take over in the seasonal sea-ice zone where iron is not limiting. No information exists on F. kerguelensis biometry from the subtropical SO, on the other extreme of the thermal and nutrient gradients. We present here new data on mean valve area of F. kerguelensis (FkergArea) from a sediment core covering the last ∼42 cal kyrs from the southern Subtropical Front (SSTF) of the Indian sector of the SO, where iron and silica stocks are thought to have been consistently low over this period. Our results suggest that larger F. kerguelensis valves occurred during the Last Glacial period, and declined during the Holocene period. These findings indicate that more favourable SST, within the F. kerguelensis ecological range, during the Last Glacial period may have enabled F. kerguelensis to make better use of the low silica stocks prevailing in the subtropical zone leading to larger valves. Conversely, declining FkergArea during the deglacial and the Holocene periods may have been a result of higher SST which hampered the utilization of silica. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2016.","biometry; diatoms; nutrient cycling; sea surface temperature","Bacillariophyta; Fragilariopsis kerguelensis"

Methods: This was a nationwide cross-sectional study of fetal ultrasound biometry. Low-risk singleton pregnancies were recruited prospectively within the network of the national French College of Fetal Ultrasound, CFEF, over a 6-week period. Further selection was performed based on the criteria of the IG-21st Project in order to obtain a comparable population. Head circumference (HC) was used as the main fat-free skeletal measure of growth for comparison of French fetal size with that of the IG-21st population. The impact of switching to the IG-21st fetal growth standards was quantified by comparing Z-scores calculated using the IG-21st standards with those calculated using locally derived reference ranges for HC, abdominal circumference (AC) and femur length (FL). Results: Following selection, 4858 cases were analyzed. The distribution of HC demonstrated clear similarity between our French population and the IG-21st population: our observed centile curves closely matched those of IG-21st and the Z-scores were close to 0 across gestational age. The IG-21st standards performed as well as did locally derived charts in terms of screening for small-for-gestational age by AC, while they identified significantly fewer small FL values than were expected and than did the locally derived charts. Conclusions: Under strict selection criteria, fetal size in France is similar to that of the international population used in the IG-21st Project.

Design: Population-based cross-sectional study. Participants: Of the 5190 participants of phase one of Shahroud Eye Cohort Study, 4737 participated in Phase two (participation rate = 91.3%). Methods: All study participants underwent visual acuity measurement, refraction tests, slit lamp examination and ophthalmoscopic fundus exam. Tests also included imaging with Cirrus HD-OCT 4000 and its RNFL thickness data were used in this study. Main Outcome Measures: The overall RNFL thickness and the average RNFL thickness in different quadrants. Results: Mean RNFL thickness in the superior, inferior, nasal and temporal quadrants were 92.47 µm [95% confidence interval (CI): 92.14–92.80], 111.22 µm (95% CI: 110.7–111.73), 118.93 µm (95% CI: 118.31–119.55), 74.83 µm (95% CI: 74.07–75.59) and 65.48 µm (95% CI: 65.06–65.90). Multiple linear regression models indicated that RNFL thickness in all quadrants decreased with ageing, was lower in females (coefficient:–0.87 and P = 0.015), decreased by 1.42 µm (P < 0.001) for each millimetre increase in axial length and decreased by 0.41 µm (P = 0.041) for each diopter decrease in spherical equivalent refraction of myopia. Conclusion: RNFL thickness in the 45 to 69-year-old Iranian population is lower compared to other studies. This difference should be noted in making disease diagnoses, particularly glaucoma. Also, there is a significant relationship between ageing and RNFL thinning in all quadrants. Longer axial length, myopia and male gender are associated with reduced RNFL thickness. © 2016 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists","glaucoma; Middle East; population-based study; retinal nerve fibre layer","aged; anatomy and histology; anthropometry; biometry; cross-sectional study; cytology; eye axis length; female; human; Iran; male; middle aged; nerve fiber; optic nerve; optical coherence tomography; physiology; retina ganglion cell; visual acuity; Aged; Anthropometry; Axial Length, Eye; Biometry; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Iran; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Fibers; Optic Nerve; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity"

Fifty Nellore heifers with 132 ± 9.9 kg average body weight (BW) and 138 ± 19 days of age were supplemented from 4 to 14 months. The heifers were distributed into five supplementation plans: HH—6 g/kg of BW of supplement pre- and post-weaning, HL—6 g/kg of BW of supplement pre-weaning and 3 g/kg post-weaning, LH—3 g/kg of BW pre-weaning and 6 g/kg of BW post-weaning, LL—3 g/kg of BW pre- and post-weaning, and CC—control, no supplementation. Interactions were not significant (P > 0.10). The level of supplement fed pre-weaning did not affect any of the performance variables evaluated at the end of the experiment (P > 0.10). There was a significant effect of supplementation and level of supplementation fed post-weaning on average daily gain (ADG) and final BW (P < 0.05). Overall ADG was also affected only by supplementation and level of supplement fed post-weaning (P < 0.05) with animals receiving 6 g/kg of BW post-weaning gaining more weight. Follicular diameter was greater in animals that received 6 g/kg of BW post-weaning (P < 0.05).

This paper represents a rotation and translation-invariant human identification algorithm based on a new definition of geometrical shape features of the retinal image using a hierarchical matching structure. Methods In this algorithm, the retinal images are represented by regions which are surrounded by blood vessels that are named Surrounded Regions (SRs). A perfect set of region-based and boundary-based features are defined on the SRs. In the boundary-based features, by defining corner points of the SR, novel features such as angle of SR corner, centroid distance and weighted corner angle are defined which they can describe well the variation rate of boundary and geometry of the SR. To match the SR of a query with enrolled SR in database, the extracted features in a hierarchical structure from simpler features through more complex features are applied to filter the enrolled SRs in the database for search space reduction. At last, the matched candidate SRs with the query SRs determine the identification or rejection of query image by proposed decision making scenario. In this scenario, the identification is carried out when at least two SRs of the query are matched with two SRs of an individual in the database. Results The proposed algorithm is evaluated on STARE and DRIVE retinal image databases in six different experiments and is achieved an accuracy rate of 100% and an average processing time of 3.216 sec and 3.225 sec, respectively. The reported results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm in the eye-movement condition. Conclusion In our work, by defining the SR-based features and employing a hierarchical matching structure, the computational complexity of matching step is reduced and also the identification performance is improved. Moreover, the proposed algorithm overcomes the problem of natural movements of the head and eye during the capturing process. © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Decision making scenario; Hierarchical matching structure; Region-based shape feature; Retina-based human identification; Surrounded region","Blood vessels; Database systems; Decision making; Eye movements; Geometry; Image processing; Ophthalmology; Query processing; Geometrical shapes; Hierarchical matching; Hierarchical structures; Human identification; Search space reduction; Shape features; Surrounded region; Translation invariants; Image matching; algorithm; Article; biometry; data base; decision making; geometry; mathematical computing; measurement accuracy; retina based human identification algorithm; retina image; anatomy and histology; forensic anthropology; human; retina; retina blood vessel; Algorithms; Biometry; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Retina; Retinal Vessels"

A total of 308 consecutive, healthy Japanese adults were examined in this prospective observational study. Eighteen subjects were also excluded because of poor quality of the fundus photograph of one or both eyes; 290 (161 men and 129 women) were included in this study. For each subject, a color fundus photograph of one eye, either the right or left, was randomly selected and used for analysis. On the photograph, the distances between the fovea and the nearest temporal margin of the optic disc (Dft), and the two kinds of disc diameters (D1 and D2), which bisected at right angles and one of which was directed to the fovea (D1), were measured. DM:DD was estimated using the formula: (2Dft + D1)/(D1 + D2). The mean ± standard deviation of DM:DD was 2.91 ± 0.49 for men and 2.96 ± 0.54 for women; there was no sex difference (P = .78, Mann-Whitney U test). Also, almost no relationship was found between DM:DD and age (ρ = -.12, P = .04, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient). The data did not fit a normal distribution (P < .001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). The estimated reference interval for DM:DD corresponding to the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles was 2.12 to 4.18. Using a nonparametric approach, the reference interval for DM:DD of a large population of healthy Japanese adults was calculated to be 2.12 to 4.18, regardless of age or sex. © 2017 the Author(s).

Herein we quantify the proportion of the population predicted to have structure–function mappings that markedly deviate from “average,” and thus would benefit from customized mapping. Design Database study and case report. Participants Population database of 2836 eyes from the Beijing Eye Study and a single case report of an individual with primary open-angle glaucoma. Methods Using the morphometric fundus data of the Beijing Eye Study for 2836 eyes and applying a recently developed model based on axial length and ONH position relative to the fovea, we determined for each measurement location in the 24-2 Humphrey (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) visual field the proportion of eyes for which, in the customized approach as compared with the generalized approach, the mapped ONH sector was shifted into a different sector. We determined the proportion of eyes for which the mapped ONH location was shifted by more than 15°, 30°, or 60°. Main Outcome Measures Mapping correspondence between locations in visual field space to localized sectors on the ONH. Results The largest interindividual differences in mapping are in the nasal step region, where the same visual field location can map to either the superior or inferior ONH, depending on other anatomic features. For these visual field locations, approximately 12% of eyes showed a mapping opposite to conventional expectations. Conclusions Anatomically customized mapping shifts the map markedly in approximately 12% of the general population in the nasal step region, where visual field locations can map to the opposite pole of the ONH than conventionally considered. Early glaucomatous damage commonly affects this region; hence, individually matching structure to function may prove clinically useful for the diagnosis and monitoring of progression within individuals. © 2017 American Academy of Ophthalmology",,"biometry; case report; computer simulation; cross-sectional study; eye axis length; factual database; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; human; intraocular pressure; nerve fiber; optic disk; optical coherence tomography; pathology; pathophysiology; perimetry; physiology; retina ganglion cell; Vision Disorders; visual field; Axial Length, Eye; Biometry; Computer Simulation; Cross-Sectional Studies; Databases, Factual; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Nerve Fibers; Optic Disk; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Vision Disorders; Visual Field Tests; Visual Fields"

We conducted a post-hoc analysis of non-primary outcomes in a trial in Gambia, with the aim to test the associations of LNS with fetal growth and explore how efficacy varies depending on nutritional status. The sample comprised 620 pregnant women in an individually randomized, partially blinded trial with four arms: (a) iron and folic acid (FeFol) tablet (usual care, referent group), (b) MMN tablet, (c) PE LNS, and (d) PE + MMN LNS. Analysis of variance examined unadjusted differences in fetal biometry z-scores at 20 and 30 weeks and neonatal anthropometry z-scores, while regression tested for modification of intervention-outcome associations by season and maternal height, body mass index, and weight gain. Despite evidence of between-arm differences in some fetal biometry, z-scores at birth were not greater in the intervention arms than the FeFol arm (e.g., birth weight z-scores: FeFol −0.71, MMN −0.63, PE −0.64, PE + MMN −0.62; group-wise p =.796). In regression analyses, intervention associations with birth weight and head circumference were modified by maternal weight gain between booking and 30 weeks gestation (e.g., PE + MMN associations with birth weight were +0.462 z-scores (95% CI [0.097, 0.826]) in the highest quartile of weight gain but –0.099 z-scores (−0.459, 0.260) in the lowest).

complementary measures used to screen for fetal growth disturbances. Our aim was to provide international EFW standards to complement the INTERGROWTH-21st Fetal Growth Standards that are available for use worldwide. Methods: Women with an accurate gestational-age assessment, who were enrolled in the prospective, international, multicenter, population-based Fetal Growth Longitudinal Study (FGLS) and INTERBIO-21st Fetal Study (FS), two components of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project, had ultrasound scans every 5 weeks from 9–14 weeks' until 40 weeks' gestation. At each visit, measurements of fetal head circumference (HC), biparietal diameter, occipitofrontal diameter, abdominal circumference (AC) and femur length (FL) were obtained blindly by dedicated research sonographers using standardized methods and identical ultrasound machines. Birth weight was measured within 12 h of delivery by dedicated research anthropometrists using standardized methods and identical electronic scales. Live babies without any congenital abnormality, who were born within 14 days of the last ultrasound scan, were selected for inclusion. As most births occurred at around 40 weeks' gestation, we constructed a bootstrap model selection and estimation procedure based on resampling of the complete dataset under an approximately uniform distribution of birth weight, thus enriching the sample size at extremes of fetal sizes, to achieve consistent estimates across the full range of fetal weight. We constructed reference centiles using second-degree fractional polynomial models. Results: Of the overall population, 2404 babies were born within 14 days of the last ultrasound scan. Mean time between the last scan and birth was 7.7 (range, 0–14) days and was uniformly distributed. Birth weight was best estimated as a function of AC and HC (without FL) as log(EFW) = 5.084820 − 54.06633 × (AC/100)3 − 95.80076 × (AC/100)3 × log(AC/100) + 3.136370 × (HC/100), where EFW is in g and AC and HC are in cm. All other measures, gestational age, symphysis–fundus height, amniotic fluid indices and interactions between biometric measures and gestational age, were not retained in the selection process because they did not improve the prediction of EFW. Applying the formula to FGLS biometric data (n = 4231) enabled gestational age-specific EFW tables to be constructed. At term, the EFW centiles matched those of the INTERGROWTH-21st Newborn Size Standards but, at &lt; 37 weeks' gestation, the EFW centiles were, as expected, higher than those of babies born preterm. Comparing EFW cross-sectional values with the INTERGROWTH-21st Preterm Postnatal Growth Standards confirmed that preterm postnatal growth is a different biological process from intrauterine growth. Conclusions: We provide an assessment of EFW, as an adjunct to routine ultrasound biometry, from 22 to 40 weeks' gestation. However, we strongly encourage clinicians to evaluate fetal growth using separate biometric measures such as HC and AC, as well as EFW, to avoid the minimalist approach of focusing on a single value. © 2016 Authors.

Methods This school-based study included 382 grade-1 children at baseline in 2011 (age:6.3-0.4 years) with 305 (79.8%) returning for the follow-up examination in 2015. At baseline and in yearly follow-up examinations, the children underwent a comprehensive eye examination including auto-refractometry, ocular biometry with measurement of axial length, and fundus photography. The parents underwent a standardized interview. Results During the study period, the mean axial length elongated by 1.15±0.56mm in boys and 1.10 ±0.63mm in girls. At baseline and at the end of follow-up, axial length was significantly (P&lt;0.001) longer in boys, with no difference (P = 0.50) between genders in axial elongation. In multivariate analysis, greater axial elongation was associated (regression coefficient r2:0.15) with less time spent outdoors (P = 0.004; standardized coefficient beta: -0.22), more time spent indoors with studying (P = 0.02; beta: 0.18) and paternal myopia (P = 0.03; beta: 0.16). Larger increases in the axial length/anterior corneal curvature (AL/CC) ratio were associated (r2:0.09) with less time spent outdoors (PP = 0.003; beta: -0.22) and maternal myopia (PP = 0.02; beta: 0.18). Conclusions Myopic axial elongation during a 4-year follow-up was associated with shorter time spent outdoors and longer time spent indoors studying and with parental myopia. Other factors such as level of paternal education, family income, gender and region of habitation were significantly associated with axial elongation and with myopia progression only in univariate analysis. © 2017 Guo et al.

The purpose of this study was to determine the endogenous regulation pattern of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) in the tree shrew sclera during myopia development and investigate the capacity of exogenous TIMP-2 to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP-2) in vitro and both scleral collagen degradation and myopia development in vivo. METHODS. TIMP-2 expression in the sclera during myopia development was assessed using polymerase chain reaction. In vitro TIMP-2 inhibition of MMP-2 was investigated using a gelatinase activity plate assay and zymography. Tree shrews were injected with a collagen precursor before undergoing monocular form deprivation and concurrent daily subconjunctival injections of either TIMP-2 or vehicle to the form-deprived eye. In vivo ocular biometry changes were monitored, and scleral tissue was collected after 12 days and assayed for collagen degradation. RESULTS. The development of myopia was associated with a mean reduction in TIMP-2 mRNA expression after 5 days of form deprivation (P < 0.01). Both activation and activity of MMP-2 were inhibited by TIMP-2 with an IC50 of 10 to 20 and 2 nM, respectively. In vivo exogenous addition of TIMP-2 significantly reduced myopia development (P < 0.01), due to reduced vitreous chamber elongation (P < 0.01). In vivo TIMP-2 treatment also significantly inhibited posterior scleral collagen degradation relative to vehicle-treated eyes (P < 0.01), with levels similar to those in control eyes. CONCLUSIONS. Myopia development in mammals is associated with reduced expression of TIMP-2, which contributes to increased degradative activity in the sclera. It follows that replenishment of this TIMP-2 significantly reduced the rate of both scleral collagen degradation and myopia development. © 2017 The Authors.","Collagen; Gene expression; Myopia",

Material and methods: This was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of 1028 unselected twin pairs recruited over a two-year period. Dichorionic twins underwent two-weekly ultrasonographic surveillance from 24 weeks’ gestation, with surveillance of monochorionic twins two-weekly from 16 weeks. Ultrasonographic biometric data from 24 to 36 weeks were evaluated for the prediction of an intertwin birthweight discordance threshold ≥18%. Umbilical artery Doppler waveform data was also analyzed to evaluate whether it was predictive of birthweight discordance. Results: Of the 956 twin pairs analyzed for discordance, 208 pairs were found to have a clinically significant birthweight discordance ≥18%. All biometric parameters were predictive of significant inter-twin birthweight discordance at low cut-offs, with low discriminatory powers when ROC curves were analyzed. Discordance in estimated fetal weight was predictive of a significant birthweight discordance at all gestational categories with cut-offs between 8 and 11%. A low-discriminatory power and poor sensitivity and specificity were also observed. An abnormal umbilical artery Doppler was predictive of birthweight discordance ≥18% between 28 and 32 weeks’ gestation, although with poor sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: Calculation of estimated fetal weight and birthweight discordance between twins allows minimal margin for error. These margins make it difficult to accurately predict those who are at or above the discordance threshold of 18%. These findings highlight that small intertwin discrepancies in weight and biometry should not be overlooked and merit further investigation. © 2017 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology","birthweight; discordance; estimation; Twins; ultrasound","adult; area under the curve; birth weight; cohort analysis; diagnostic imaging; evaluation study; female; fetus echography; human; intrauterine growth retardation; newborn; predictive value; pregnancy; prospective study; second trimester pregnancy; Sweden; third trimester pregnancy; twins; umbilical artery; Adult; Area Under Curve; Birth Weight; Cohort Studies; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Predictive Value of Tests; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Prospective Studies; Sweden; Twins; Ultrasonography, Prenatal; Umbilical Arteries"

Methods: This was a prospective cohort study performed within a UK specialist fetal growth clinic. A total of 105 consecutive pregnant women referred for a suspected SGA fetus were included. All pregnancies were managed according to a standard protocol using estimated fetal weight (EFW) plotted on customized Gestation Related Optimal Weight (GROW) charts. The last antenatal estimates of EFW (according to charts of GROW, Hadlock et al. and Mikolajczyk et al.), abdominal circumference (AC) (according to charts of Hadlock et al., INTERGROWTH-21st Project and Chitty et al.) or change in AC over time (calculated according to Pregnancy Outcome Prediction (POP) study) were compared against four birth-weight charts (GROW, INTERGROWTH-21st, Mikolajczyk et al. and World Health Organization (WHO)). The ability of each antenatal test to predict adverse perinatal outcome (APO) was assessed. Results: Birth weight &lt; 10th centile was assigned in 62 (59%) neonates using the GROW chart, 57 (54%) using the Mikolajczyk et al. chart, 55 (52%) using the INTERGROWTH-21st chart and 51 (49%) using the WHO chart. AC-Hadlock had the best negative likelihood ratio (range, 0.3–0.4) and sensitivity (range, 74%–82%) for predicting SGA as defined by all four postnatal birth-weight charts. AC-INTERGROWTH-21st had the best positive likelihood ratio (range, 5.9–10.9) and specificity (94%–96%). For prediction of APO, AC-Hadlock and EFW-GROW had the best sensitivities (57% and 52%, respectively), whereas AC-POP had the best positive likelihood ratio (2.2) and specificity (88%). Antenatal prediction of APO increased to a sensitivity of 61% when AC-POP and EFW-GROW were combined; however, specificity was only 56%. Conclusions: We have identified wide variation in the diagnostic accuracy of various antenatal tools for the prediction of both SGA and APO, dependent on the choice of chart. Suboptimal diagnostic accuracy of commonly used antenatal tests may lead to increasing medicalization without prevention of APO. Researchers should focus their attention on a combination of fetal biometry and biomarkers for better prediction of SGA and prevention of APO. Copyright © 2016 ISUOG.

To overcome this, we developed a system of wireless health monitoring in cattle farm. Here, we measure biological parameters such as temperature, ph value, and wound indication. These parameters are measured using wireless sensors, which are attached on the cattle's body. All these sensors form Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN). The wireless sensors are coordinated by a microcontroller. The sensors sense the parameters and transmit them to a monitoring system. To reduce power consumption, whenever there is abnormal change in temperature, it enables the other two sensors, which means that the temperature sensor acts as a wake up devices. In the monitoring system, all three values are viewed, and if any value seems to exceed the default value, an alarm will be produced. Here, ph value of cattle's urine is noted, because when the acidity in the cattle's urine increases, liver may gets damaged. The RGB sensor is used to identify starting stage wound, by identifying the changes in colour. The RGB sensor with temperature sensor is used to identify foot mouth disease. The microcontroller that we used here is ARM7 Microcontroller. Thus, the parameters are sensed and transmitted to the monitoring system, from which health status is monitored. © 2016 IEEE.","ARM7 Micro controller; Biological parameter; Sensors; WBSN; Wireless health monitoring","Body fluids; Body sensor networks; Controllers; Health; Microcontrollers; pH; Sensors; Temperature sensors; Wireless sensor networks; Abnormal change; Biological parameter; Health monitoring; Monitoring system; WBSN; Wireless body sensor networks; Wireless Health Monitoring; Wireless sensor; Monitoring"

We contribute with a robust dynamic trust model algorithm that can be applied to any continuous authentication system, irrespective of the biometric modality. We also contribute a novel performance reporting technique for continuous authentication. Our proposed approach was validated with extensive experiments with a unique behavioural biometric dataset. This dataset was collected under complete uncontrolled condition from 53 users by using our data collection software. We considered both keystroke and mouse usage behaviour patterns to prevent a situation where an attacker avoids detection by restricting to one input device because the system only checks the other input device. During our research, we developed a feature selection technique that could be applied to other pattern recognition problems. The best result obtained in this research is that 50 out of 53 genuine users are never inadvertently locked out by the system, while the remaining 3 genuine users (i. e. 5.7%) are sometimes locked out, on average after 2265 actions. Furthermore, there are only 3 out of 2756 impostors not been detected, i.e. only 0.1% of the impostors go undetected.

Therefore, the objectives of this study were to estimate the genetic parameters of the traits: plant height at 12 and 40 months, canopy projection on the row at 12 and 40 months, canopy projection between the row at 12 and 40 months, number of branches at 40 months, grain yield, and oil yield; to verify the existence of phenotypic correlation between these traits; to verify the influence of the morphological traits on oil yield by means of path analysis; and to evaluate the relationship between the productive traits in Jatropha and the morphological traits measured at different ages. Sixty-seven half-sib families were evaluated using a completely randomized block design with two replications and five plants per plot. Analysis of variance was used to estimate the genetic value. Phenotypic correlations were given by the Pearson correlation between traits. For the canonical correlation analysis, two groups of traits were established: group I, consisting of traits of economic importance for the culture, and group II, consisting of morphological traits. Path analysis was carried out considering oil yield as the main dependent variable. Genetic variability was observed among Jatropha families. Productive traits can be indirectly selected via morphological traits due to the correlation between these two groups of traits. Therefore, canonical correlations and path analysis are two strategies that may be useful in Jatropha-breeding program when the objective is to select productive traits via morphological traits.",,"biofuel; vegetable oil; biometry; Brazil; genetic variation; genetics; Jatropha; metabolism; plant breeding; procedures; Biofuels; Biometry; Brazil; Genetic Variation; Jatropha; Plant Breeding; Plant Oils"

Methods: A retrospective cohort study of GR was carried out in 184 selected SGA singletons using a novel, composite measure of growth abnormalities termed the FGPS1. Serial fetal biometry was used to establish second trimester Rossavik size models and determine FGPS1 values prior to delivery. FGPS1 data were compared to neonatal growth outcomes assessed using growth potential realization index (GPRI) values (average negative pathological GPRI (av − pGPRI)). Growth at the end of pregnancy was evaluated from differences in negative, individual composite prenatal growth assessment scores (-icPGAS) measured at the last two ultrasound scans. The FGPS1 and av − pGPRI values were used to classify fetal growth and neonatal growth outcomes, respectively, as Normal (N) or Abnormal (A). Results: The risk of neonatal GR (based on birth weight (BW)) was moderate (MR: between 5th and10th percentiles (n = 113)) or significant (SR:<5th percentile) (n = 71)). Individual pregnancies were grouped into four categories, two representing agreement (N–N (29%), A–A (40%)) and two representing discordance (N–A (11%), A–N (20%)). In the largest and most variable subgroup (A–A,<5%tile, n = 49), there was a statistically significant correlation (0.63, p < .0001) between the FGPS1 and av − pGPRI. In N–A, all 20 cases (100%) had long last-scan-to-delivery intervals (1.9 weeks or greater), suggesting late development of the growth abnormality. For A–N, in approximately equal proportions, GR was improving, progressing or unclassifiable at the end of pregnancy. Conclusions: Significant agreement between prenatal and postnatal growth assessments was found using a novel approach for quantifying fetal growth pathology (FGPS1). Discordances appear to be due to lack of appropriate prenatal scans or an inadequate set of neonatal measurements. Evidence for a quantitative relationship between assessment methods was seen in the largest and most variable subgroup. The FGPS1 has the potential for characterizing GR in the third trimester and may provide a means for predicting the severity of corresponding abnormal neonatal growth outcomes. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","Individualized growth assessment; longitudinal growth study; SGA",

Whether myopia in Knobloch syndrome is axial or lenticular is unclear. Also not known are the optical coherence tomography (OCT) correlates to the distinct fundus appearance. In this study we assess cycloplegic refraction, biometry, and macular spectral domain (SD) OCT in children with Knobloch syndrome. Methods: A retrospective case series of seven children (12 eyes) with Knobloch syndrome. Results: Twelve eyes with attached retinas (seven patients, aged 6–17 years old, mean 11 years) were identified, seven of which had OCT. Best-corrected vision was typically 20/300 or worse. Axial length divided by corneal radius was >3 for all eyes (3.23–3.77, mean 3.52), consistent with axial myopia, and axial lengths (26.58–30.27 mm, mean 28.16) were consistent with spherical equivalent degree of myopia (−10.00 to −18.50, mean −12) when compared to historical controls. OCT revealed lack of choriocapillaries, outer retinal disorganization, and lack of or only rudimentary foveal pit. Conclusions: Refractions and biometry in Knobloch syndrome are consistent with the myopia being axial.

Results: Patients in the Tetraflex group showed better distance-corrected near visual acuity (logMAR 0.43±0.10 vs. logMAR 0.51±0.10, P<0.05) and greater AMP (1.99±0.58 diopters [D] vs. 1.59±0.45 D, P<0.05) compared with the control group. The measurement of the postoperative anterior chamber depth (ACD) during accommodation showed a forward movement of the AIOLs in 16 eyes (69.6%). Compared with the control group, a greater proportion of cases in the Tetraflex group experienced forward movement (χ 2 test, P<0.001). The AMP in the AIOL group negatively correlated with changes in postoperative ACD during accommodation (r=-0.47, P<0.05), whereas AMP in the control group negatively correlated with postoperative pupil diameter (r=-0.57, P<0.05). Conclusions: The Tetraflex AIOLs seemed to have a tendency for forward movement; however, the slight forward axial shifts of the Tetraflex AIOL during natural accommodation may not produce a clinically relevant change in optical power. © 2016 Contact Lens Association of Ophthalmologists.","Accommodation; Anterior segment biometry; Intraocular lens; Treatment outcome","accommodation; aged; anterior eye segment; biometry; case control study; female; human; lens implant; lens implantation; male; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; phacoemulsification; physiology; procedures; retrospective study; standards; visual acuity; Accommodation, Ocular; Aged; Anterior Eye Segment; Biometry; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Lens Implantation, Intraocular; Lenses, Intraocular; Male; Middle Aged; Phacoemulsification; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity"

Methods: Fetal biometry and Doppler hemodynamics (uterine artery (UtA), umbilical artery (UA) and fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA)) were measured serially in a cohort of consecutive fetuses diagnosed with CHD. Evaluations were made at various time points, from diagnosis (20–25 weeks) to delivery, with at least two measurements per fetus that were at least 2 weeks apart. Fetuses were classified into three groups according to the pattern of blood supply to the brain (placental vs systemic) that would be expected on the basis of the type of CHD. All parameters were transformed into Z-scores. A linear mixed model to analyze repeated measurements was constructed for each parameter to assess its behavior throughout gestation. Results: Four hundred and forty-four ultrasound examinations were performed in 119 CHD fetuses, with a median of two measurements per fetus. The fetuses presented a small head at diagnosis (biparietal diameter (BPD) Z-score, −1.32 ± 0.99; head circumference (HC) Z-score, −0.79 ± 1.02), which remained small throughout gestation. UtA and UA pulsatility indices (PI) showed a significant increase towards the end of pregnancy, whereas no significant changes were observed in MCA-PI or cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) with gestational age. Both MCA and CPR presented significant differences in longitudinal behavior between CHD groups, while BPD and HC did not. Conclusions: CHD fetuses have a relatively small head from the second trimester of pregnancy, regardless of the type of CHD anomaly, and increasing resistance in the UtA and UA as pregnancy progresses, suggestive of increasing degree of placental impairment. Our findings indicate the early onset of mechanisms that could lead to poorer neurodevelopment later in life. Copyright © 2016 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Copyright © 2016 ISUOG.

For this, two measurements were made regarding the scrotal circumference (SC), length (L) and testicular width (W) before treatments. The testicular volume (V) was calculated by the formula V=2 [(r2) x p x H]. The pouches were made with double-layer plastic, internally lined with cotton, and fixed around the spermatic funiculus and scrotum with adhesive tape and bandage remaining in this position for seven days. Measurements were made every seven days, totaling 15 measurements throughout the experiment. The data were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA) to a randomized block design with two blocks, 15 treatments and four replications. The variables analyzed were subjected to Dunnett test at 5% probability, to compare the values obtained before and after insulation. For comparison between the breeds, the variables were submitted to Tukey test at 5% probability. All animals studied suffered significant influence (P &lt; 0.05) after scrotal insulation, but Santa Ines returned to the values previously observed in a shorter period than the crossbred. In summary, sheep Santa Ines have a higher resistance than crossbred animals when subjected to thermal stress induced by scrotal insulation.","Circle; Racial crossing; Scrotal insulation; Scrotum-testicular biometry; Sheep; Testis; Thermoregulation",

Methods: In this prospective study, data were collected from a multicenter singleton cohort study investigating the links between various exposures during pregnancy with birth outcome and later health in children. We included women, recruited in the first trimester, who had complete outcome data and had undergone third-trimester ultrasound examination. Demographic, clinical and biological variables were also collected from both parents. We compared prediction of delivery of a SGA neonate (birth weight &lt; 10th percentile) by the following methods: abdominal circumference (AC) Z-score based on Hadlock curves (Hadlock AC), on INTERGROWTH-21st Project curves (Intergrowth AC) and on Salomon curves (Salomon AC); estimated fetal weight (EFW) Z-score based on Hadlock curves (Hadlock EFW) and on customized curves from Gardosi (Gardosi EFW); and fetal growth velocity based on change in AC between second and third trimesters (FGVAC). We also assessed the following ultrasound–delivery intervals: ≤ 4 weeks, ≤ 6 weeks and ≤ 10 weeks. Results: Third-trimester ultrasound was performed in 1805 patients with complete outcome data, of whom 158 (8.8%) delivered a SGA neonate. Ultrasound examination was at a median gestational age of 32 (interquartile range, 31–33) weeks. The ultrasound–delivery interval was ≤ 4 weeks in 17.2% of cases, ≤ 6 weeks in 48.1% of cases and ≤ 10 weeks in 97.3% of cases. Areas under the receiver–operating characteristics curve (AUC) were 0.772 for Salomon AC, 0.768 for Hadlock EFW, 0.766 for Hadlock AC, 0.765 for Intergrowth AC, 0.708 for Gardosi EFW and 0.674 for FGVAC (all P &lt; 0.0001). The screening method with the highest AUC for an ultrasound–delivery interval ≤ 4 weeks was Salomon AC (AUC, 0.856), ≤ 6 weeks was Hadlock AC (AUC, 0.824) and ≤ 10 weeks was Salomon AC (AUC, 0.780). At a fixed 10% false-positive rate, the best detection rates were 60.0%, 54.1% and 42.1% for intervals ≤ 4, ≤ 6 and ≤ 10 weeks, respectively. Conclusion: Third-trimester ultrasound measurements provide poor to moderate prediction of SGA. A shorter ultrasound–delivery interval provides better prediction than does a longer interval. Further studies are needed to test the effect of including maternal or biological characteristics in SGA screening. Copyright © 2016 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

Design Retrospective interventional case series. Methods Twenty-six eyes of 26 patients underwent phacoemulsification with implantation of a ZA9003 IOL (Abbott Medical Optics Inc, Santa Ana, California, USA) in the ciliary sulcus. We analyzed correlations among preoperative biometry data and ultrasound biomicroscopy measurements, ciliary sulcus diameter, posterior vault distance, and effective lens position. Regression analyses were performed to identify which combination of preoperative biometry data, average corneal power (keratometry [K]), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and axial length (AL) was best for predicting effective lens position. Results The sulcus diameter was shorter in eyes that had a steep cornea and shorter AL. The posterior vault distance was negatively correlated with sulcus diameter in subjects who had shorter postoperative time intervals (≤24 months) (R2 = 0.336 and P = .038). The posterior vault distance decreased with each passing postoperative month (R2 = 0.158 and P = .045). The R2 value for predicting the effective lens positions of sulcus-implanted IOLs based on the entire average K, ACD, and AL was higher than those based on parts of these values. Conclusions The effective lens position of sulcus-implanted IOLs can be affected by sulcus diameter, and lens position can change, especially in the early postoperative period. We recommend using the entire average K, ACD, and AL to predict the effective position of sulcus-implanted IOLs. © 2016",,"adult; aged; anterior eye chamber depth; Article; biometry; biomicroscopy; ciliary sulcus diameter; clinical article; cornea; eye axis length; female; human; keratometry; lens implant; lens implantation; male; outcome assessment; partial coherence interferometry biometer; phacoemulsification; posterior vault distance; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; retrospective study; slit lamp; visual system parameters; acoustic microscopy; anterior eye chamber; ciliary body; diagnostic imaging; follow up; lens implantation; middle aged; procedures; prosthesis design; surgery; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anterior Chamber; Biometry; Ciliary Body; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lens Implantation, Intraocular; Lenses, Intraocular; Male; Microscopy, Acoustic; Middle Aged; Prosthesis Design; Retrospective Studies"

This work aims at assessing the outcomes of cataract surgery at Kasr Al Ainy Hospital and identifying the reasons for borderline and poor outcome in the studied group. Methods: A total of 150 eyes of patients with cataract and no other ocular pathology were included in this study. Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and corrected visual acuity (CVA), complete ocular examination using slit-lamp, applanation tonometry, and ophthalmoscopy were performed for all patients. Biometry for intraocular lens power calculation and operative data were recorded. Patients were followed for 6 weeks; UCVA, CVA, and any complications were noted. Results: Mean preoperative CVA was 0.16 ± 0.16 (SD) and mean postoperative CVA was 0.66 ± 0.33 (p<0.001). Forty-two percent of surgeries were performed by junior staff under training. Thirty-five surgeries were complicated by posterior capsular rupture. Mean CVA at 6 weeks in the uncomplicated group was 0.77 ± 0.22; in the complicated group, 0.28 ± 0.34 (p<0.001). Biometry was accurate in 51.6% of cases. Most important causes for suboptimal outcome were aphakia, astigmatism, posterior capsular opacification, and corneal edema. Conclusions: Kasr Al Ainy Hospital achieved CVA 6/9 or more in 69.3% and CVA 6/18 or more in 81.3% of patients. The capsular complication rate was high at 23.3%.

Materials and Methods: This study comprised 45 eyes from 45 OAG subjects and 63 eyes from 63 non-glaucomatous cataract subjects (controls). We investigated differences in preoperative predicted refractive errors and postoperative refractive errors for each group. Preoperative predicted refractive errors were obtained by biometry (IOL-master) and compared to postoperative refractive errors measured by auto-refractometer 2 months postoperatively. Anterior angle parameters were determined using swept source optical coherence tomography. We investigated correlations between preoperative angle parameters [angle open distance (AOD); trabecular iris surface area (TISA); angle recess area (ARA); trabecular iris angle (TIA)] and postoperative unpredicted refractive errors. Results: In patients with OAG, significant differences were noted between preoperative predicted and postoperative real refractive errors, with more myopia than predicted. No significant differences were recorded in controls. Angle parameters (AOD, ARA, TISA, and TIA) at the superior and inferior quadrant were significantly correlated with differences between predicted and postoperative refractive errors in OAG patients (-0.321 to -0.408, p&lt;0.05).

Objective: This study was to compare the differences of IOL powers measured and calculated by different apparatus and different IOL power formulas before cataract extraction+ IOL implantation silicon oil tamponade combined with cataractous eyes. Methods: A prospective, consecutive, nonrandomized study was performed. Thirty-six silicon oil tamponade with cataract eyes of 36 patients were included in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from August 2011 to October 2013.Patients with silicone oil emulsification for 4 months to 2 years prepared to treat by cataract extraction+ IOL implantation+ silicon oil removal. Axial length (AL), corneal curvature (CC) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were measured with IOLMaster and A-scan with manual kerameter (MK) in the eyes for the prediction of IOL power by SRK-II, SRK/T, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1 and Haigis formulas under the oral informed consent. The mean predictive error (MPE) and mean absolute refractive error (MAE) between predictive IOL diopters before operation and actual IOL diopters after operation were evaluated. Results: The AL and ACD values measured by IOLMaster was (25.43±0.90)mm and (3.22±0.38)mm, which were significantly higher than (25.21±1.02)mm and (3.07±0.62)mm by A-scan+ MK respectively, the difference between the two measure methods was statistical significance(both at P=0.000). No significant difference was found in measured CC values between IOLMaster and A-scan+ MK ([44.58±1.57]D vs.[44.56±1.62]D) (P=0.568). When the parameters measured by IOLMaster were used, the MAE from SRK/T formula was smaller than that from SRK-II, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1 and Haigis formulas (P=0.017, 0.009, 0.012, 0.001), and the MAE from Haigis formula was significantly larger than that from SRK-II, Hoffer Q and Holladay 1 formulas (P=0.026, 0.035, 0.021). When measured by A-scan+ MK, the MAE from Haigis formula was significantly larger than that from SRK-II, SRK/T, Hoffer Q and Holladay 1 formulas (P=0.007, 0.004, 0.018, 0.006). There was no significant difference in the number of eyes with MAE≤1.0 D between IOLMaster and A-scan+ MK measurements under the calculation of SRK-I, SRK/T, Hoffer Q and Holladay 1 formulas (χ2=0.107, 2.250, 0.845, 0.084, all at P&gt;0.05). However, the number of eyes with MAE≤1.0 D was significantly increased in IOLMaster measurement compared with A-scan+ MK under the calculation of Haigis formula (χ2=4.431, P=0.035). Conclusions: In silicon oil-filled cataract eyes, SRK/T formula appears to have a more accurate predictive value of IOL power than that of other formulas when employ IOLMaster; when use A-scan+ MK measurement, the predictive value of IOL power seems to be better by using SRK-II, SRK/T, Holladay 1 or Hoffer Q formulas.

Methods: The rad-rd© was used (in conjunction with a PC and microphone) for the computer-based measurements. In rotation, each of four examiners took a turn reading the 12 sentences from one of the four RADNER Reading Charts to three other examiners, who served as stoppers. The stoppers simultaneously measured the reading time with a stopwatch while a fifth investigator used the rad-rd© to obtain computerized measurements. The stopwatch measurements were then statistically compared with the rad-rd© measurements. Results: The mean reading time obtained with the stopwatch measurements was 4.34 ± 0.57 seconds (196.21 ± 21.79 wpm), versus 4.44 ± 0.59 seconds (192.24 ± 22.20 wpm) by computer measurement (r = 0.84). Of the 144 stopwatch measurements, 97 (67.36%) were shorter, and 47 (32.64%) were equal to (n = 5) or longer than the computer measurements. The mean difference for the shorter measurements was −0.17 ± 0.1 seconds (3.91% of the mean reading time), and the mean difference for the longer measurements was 0.11 ± 0.1 seconds (2.53% of the mean reading time). Most differences ranged from −0.1 to 0.1 seconds (42.36%). The results did not differ significantly among the four stoppers. Conclusion: The rad-rd© is an accurate, automated computer program for measuring reading time. Stopwatch measurements, although subject to inaccuracy from several sources, remain a reliable and simple method for analysis of reading performance. © 2016 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

Camera trapping and biometric computer vision are recent technological advances. They have impacted on the methods applicable to field surveys and these methods have gained significant momentum over the last decade. Yet, most researchers inspect footage manually and few studies have used automated semantic processing of video trap data from the field. The particular aim of this study is to evaluate methods that incorporate automated face detection technology as an aid to estimate site use of two chimpanzee communities based on camera trapping. As a comparative baseline we employ traditional manual inspection of footage. Our analysis focuses specifically on the basic parameter of occurrence where we assess the performance and practical value of chimpanzee face detection software. We found that the semi-automated data processing required only 2–4% of the time compared to the purely manual analysis. This is a non-negligible increase in efficiency that is critical when assessing the feasibility of camera trap occupancy surveys. Our evaluations suggest that our methodology estimates the proportion of sites used relatively reliably. Chimpanzees are mostly detected when they are present and when videos are filmed in high-resolution: the highest recall rate was 77%, for a false alarm rate of 2.8% for videos containing only chimpanzee frontal face views. Certainly, our study is only a first step for transferring face detection software from the lab into field application. Our results are promising and indicate that the current limitation of detecting chimpanzees in camera trap footage due to lack of suitable face views can be easily overcome on the level of field data collection, that is, by the combined placement of multiple high-resolution cameras facing reverse directions. This will enable to routinely conduct chimpanzee occupancy surveys based on camera trapping and semi-automated processing of footage.

Methods Eighty eyes of 80 patients scheduled to undergo cataract surgery were examined with both biometers. The measurements made using each device were axial length (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT), aqueous depth (AQD), lens thickness (LT), mean keratometry (MK), white-to-white distance (WTW), and pupil diameter (PD). Holladay 2 and SRK/T formulas were used to calculate IOL power. Differences in measurement between the two biometers were determined using the paired t-test. Agreement was assessed through intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. Results Mean patient age was 76.3±6.8 years (range 59-89). Using the Lenstar, AL and PD could not be measured in 12.5 and 5.25% of eyes, respectively, while IOLMaster 700 took all measurements in all eyes. The variables CCT, AQD, LT, and MK varied significantly between the two biometers. According to ICCs, correlation between measurements made with both devices was excellent except for WTW and PD. Using the SRK/T formula, IOL power prediction based on the data from the two devices were statistically different, but differences were not clinically significant. Conclusions No clinically relevant differences were detected between the biometers in terms of their measurements and IOL power predictions. Using the IOLMaster 700, it was easier to obtain biometric measurements in eyes with less transparent ocular media or longer AL. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

It is known that hormonal imbalance may disrupt its development predisposing this gland to develop diseases during aging. Although the hypothesis regarding earlier origins of prostate diseases was proposed many years ago, the mechanisms underlying this complex phenomenon are poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prostates of old male gerbils exposed to testosterone during intrauterine and postnatal life using morphological, biometrical, stereological, Kariometric, immunohistochemical, and immunofluorescence analyses. Our findings demonstrate that prenatal and pubertal exposure to testosterone increases the susceptibility to the development of prostate diseases during aging. The presence of a more proliferative gland associated with foci of adenomatous hyperplasia in animals exposed to testosterone during the prenatal and pubertal phase show that the utero life and the pubertal period are important phases for prostatic morphophysiology establishment, which is a determinant for the health of the gland during aging. Therefore, these findings reinforce the idea that prostate disease may result from hormonal disruptions in early events during prostate development, which imprint permanently on the gland predisposing it to develop lesions in later stages of life. © 2017 AJA, SIMM & SJTU.

However, the medical records transmitted in TMIS are exposed to unsecured public networks, so TMIS are more vulnerable to various types of security threats and attacks. To provide privacy protection for TMIS, a secure and efficient authenticated key agreement scheme is urgently needed to protect the sensitive medical data. Recently, Mishra et al. proposed a biometrics-based authenticated key agreement scheme for TMIS by using hash function and nonce, they claimed that their scheme could eliminate the security weaknesses of Yan et al.'s scheme and provide dynamic identity protection and user anonymity. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that Mishra et al.'s scheme suffers from replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and fails to provide perfect forward secrecy. To overcome the weaknesses of Mishra et al.'s scheme, we then propose a three-factor authenticated key agreement scheme to enable the patient to enjoy the remote healthcare services via TMIS with privacy protection. The chaotic map-based cryptography is employed in the proposed scheme to achieve a delicate balance of security and performance.

As there is security need within wide array of applications including transactions security across computer networks, PIN (personal identification number) replacement in retail business and banking, high-security wireless access, televoting as well as restricted areas’ admission, biometric is more and more a subject of interest. The traditional mode of personal identification verification is grounded on possession (ID card) or knowledge (secret code) but ID cards could be stolen or lost while codes could be forgotten. These problems could allow opportunity to criminals to steal someone’s identity. As such, using features that are uniquely belonging to a person would decrease fraud possibility. Also, in many situations, the use of biometry is convenience. This is because biometry can take over the use of codes, keys and cards. Also, fingerprint is regarded as biometric that is most practical. With regard to performance, applications of pattern recognition mostly rely on extraction of feature and classification or learning scheme, the extraction and selection of meaningful features. This generates major problem in identification of fingerprint; how to attain features in numerous fingerprint styles so that the right individual could be reflected. Geometric Moments is proposed by this paper for feature extraction with identification of fingerprints and analyze its performance. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Biometric; Fingerprint; Geometric moment invariant; Global feature; Identification; Individuality; Uniqueness presentation",

This study aimed to identify variations in micromorphological characteristics of flower petals and their relationship to melittophily, ornithophily and chiropterophily pollination systems. The petals of 11 species were analysed using scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy and the micromorphological traits were described, measured and compared using Tukey's test, PCA and cluster analysis. Unlike chiropterophily, all melittophilous and some ornithophilous species possessed adaxial epidermal conical cells. Cluster grouping separated chiropterophilous flowers from melittophilous and ornithophilous. PCA analysis showed that the two morphometric profile of conical cells was the attribute that most strongly influenced the grouping of species. When considering the data set of the three pollination systems, melittophilous and ornithophilous plants were more similar to each other than they were to chriopterophilous species. The distance between conical cell apices is an important parameter in interactions with pollinators. This study facilitated recognition of smoothing pollinator resource access through petal micromorphological characteristics.

Setting Twenty-one Kaiser Permanente surgery centers, Northern California, USA. Design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Quality experts performed a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) that included an evaluation of sterile processing, pharmaceuticals, perioperative clinic and surgical center visits, and biometry. Potential failures in human factors and communication (modes) were identified. Rates of endophthalmitis, toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS), and unintended intraocular lens (IOL) implantation were assessed in eyes having bilateral same-day surgery from 2010 through 2014. Results The study comprised 4754 eyes. The analysis identified 15 significant potential failure modes. These included lapses in instrument processing and compounding errors of intracameral antibiotics that could lead to endophthalmitis or TASS, and ambiguous documentation of IOL selection by surgeons, which could lead to unintended IOL implantation. Of the study sample, 1 eye developed endophthalmitis, 1 eye had unintended IOL implantation (rates, 2 per 10 000; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1-12.0 per 10 000), and no eyes developed TASS (upper 95% CI, 8 per 10 000). Recommendations included improving oversight of cleaning and sterilization practices, separating lots of compounded drugs for each eye, and enhancing IOL verification procedures. Conclusions Potential failure modes and recommended actions in bilateral same-day cataract surgery were determined using an FMEA. These findings might help improve the reliability and safety of bilateral same-day cataract surgery based on current evidence and standards. © 2017 ASCRS and ESCRS",,

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 104 fetuses with CCD undergoing MRI between 2006 and 2016. Corpus callosum, cavum septi pellucidi, biometry, presence of ventriculomegaly, gyration anomalies, cranio-encephalic abnormalities and body malformations were evaluated. Results of genetic tests were also recorded. Results: At MRI, isolated CCD was 26.9%, the rest being associated to other abnormalities. In the isolated group, median gestational age at MRI was lower in complete agenesis than in hypoplasia (22 vs 28 weeks). In the group with additional findings, cortical dysplasia was the most frequently associated feature (P = 0.008), with a more frequent occurrence in complete agenesis (70%) versus other forms; mesial frontal lobes were more often involved than other cortical regions (P = 0.006), with polymicrogyria as the most frequent cortical malformation (40%). Multivariate analysis confirmed the association between complete agenesis and cortical dysplasia (odds ratio = 7.29, 95% confidence interval 1.51–35.21). Conclusions: CCD is often complicated by other intra-cranial and extra-cranial findings (cortical dysplasias as the most prevalent) that significantly affect the postnatal prognosis. The present study showed CCD with associated anomalies as more frequent than isolated (73.1%). In isolated forms, severe ventriculomegaly was a reliable herald of future appearance of associated features. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,

Methods: Systematic review of evidence followed by modified Delphi method to compile questions, elicit expert opinions and reach consensus. Results: Family planning should be discussed as early as possible after diagnosis. Most women can have successful pregnancies and measures can be taken to reduce the risks of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Risk stratification includes disease activity, autoantibody profile, previous vascular and pregnancy morbidity, hypertension and the use of drugs (emphasis on benefits from hydroxychloroquine and antiplatelets/anticoagulants). Hormonal contraception and menopause replacement therapy can be used in patients with stable/inactive disease and low risk of thrombosis. Fertility preservation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues should be considered prior to the use of alkylating agents. Assisted reproduction techniques can be safely used in patients with stable/inactive disease; patients with positive antiphospholipid antibodies/APS should receive anticoagulation and/or low-dose aspirin. Assessment of disease activity, renal function and serological markers is important for diagnosing disease flares and monitoring for obstetrical adverse outcomes. Fetal monitoring includes Doppler ultrasonography and fetal biometry, particularly in the third trimester, to screen for placental insufficiency and small for gestational age fetuses. Screening for gynaecological malignancies is similar to the general population, with increased vigilance for cervical premalignant lesions if exposed to immunosuppressive drugs. Human papillomavirus immunisation can be used in women with stable/inactive disease. Conclusions: Recommendations for women's health issues in SLE and/or APS were developed using an evidence-based approach followed by expert consensus. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.","Antiphospholipid Antibodies; Antiphospholipid Syndrome; Multidisciplinary team-care; Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; Ultrasonography","oral contraceptive agent; antiphospholipid syndrome; consensus development; Delphi study; early cancer diagnosis; estrogen therapy; family planning; female; fertility preservation; fetus monitoring; Genital Neoplasms, Female; human; infertility therapy; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; menopause; practice guideline; pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; prepregnancy care; risk assessment; Antiphospholipid Syndrome; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal; Delphi Technique; Early Detection of Cancer; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Family Planning Services; Female; Fertility Preservation; Fetal Monitoring; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Menopause; Preconception Care; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted; Risk Assessment"

Design: Cross-sectional school-based study. Participants: Six thousand twenty-six children aged 4–18 years were included in the Shandong Children Eye Study. Methods: Horizontal corneal diameter was measured by laser interferometry-based ocular biometry. Main Outcome Measures: Horizontal corneal diameter. Results: Corneal diameter measurements were available for 5970 (99.1%) children. In multivariate analysis, larger horizontal corneal diameter (mean: 12.02 ± 0.38 mm; range: 10.1–15.0 mm) was associated with longer corneal curvature radius longer axial length, male gender, younger maternal age, rural region of habitation and lower intraocular pressure measurements. Higher prevalence of abnormally large corneas (macrocorneas; horizontal diameter ≥ 12.76 mm; mean value +2 × standard deviations; mean: 2.6%; 95% CI: 2.2, 3.0) was associated with longer corneal curvature radius, longer axial length, younger maternal age and male gender. Higher prevalence of abnormally small corneas (horizontal diameter ≤ 11.24mm; mean value −2 × standard deviations; mean: 2.4%; 95% CI: 2.0, 2.8) was correlated with shorter corneal curvature radius, shorter axial length and urban region of habitation. Neither abnormally large nor small corneas were correlated with time spent indoors/outdoors. Conclusions: In 4 to 18-year-old children, larger corneal diameter was associated most strongly with flatter corneal curvature, followed by longer axial length and male gender.

Design Cross-sectional, population-based study. Participants Patients with T2DM from the Beixinjing community, Changning district, Shanghai. Methods Random clustering sampling was used to identify adults with T2DM in the Beixinjing community. Spherical equivalent (SE) was determined by subjective refraction that achieved the best corrected vision. Axial length (AL), corneal power (CP), and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were measured using the IOLMaster. Diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema (DME) were assessed according to the international DR classification. Main Outcome Measures The crystalline lens power was calculated using the Bennett–Rabbetts formula. The AL–to–corneal radius ratio (AL/CR ratio) was defined as the axial length divided by the mean corneal radius of curvature. Results A total of 4011 eyes of 2057 subjects with T2DM were included in the analysis. In multivariate logistic models adjusting for age, sex, duration of diabetes, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, serum creatinine, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and cataract, after categorizing values into quartiles, there were trend associations between lens power and any DR (P = 0.01), between AL/CR ratio and any DR (P = 0.02), and between AL and any DR (P = 0.03), between lens power and moderate DR (P = 0.02), and between AL and moderate DR (P = 0.02); eyes with higher AL/CR ratio were less likely to have any DR (odds ratio [OR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24–0.78; P = 0.01 per 1 increase) and moderate DR (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21–0.93; P = 0.03 per 1 increase), eyes with longer AL were less likely to have any DR (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81–0.95; P = 0.002 per millimeter increase) or moderate DR (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80–0.98; P = 0.02 per millimeter increase), and eyes with higher SE were more likely to have any DR (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03–1.13; P = 0.003 per diopter increase). Conclusions In persons with T2DM, lens power, AL/CR ratio, and AL were associated with the presence of any DR and moderate DR.

Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of low-risk singleton pregnancies undergoing ultrasound assessment at 37 weeks. At study inclusion, biometry for estimated fetal weight (EFW), and fetoplacental Doppler variables (uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI), cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) and umbilical vein blood flow (UVBF) normalized by EFW) were measured. SGA was defined as a customized birth weight between the 3rd and 10th centiles, and FGR was defined as a birth weight &lt; 3rd centile, according to local standards. Adverse perinatal outcomes included emergency Cesarean section for non-reassuring fetal status, 5-min Apgar score &lt; 7 and neonatal acidosis at birth. Results: A total of 946 pregnancies were included in the study. Of these, 89 (9.4%) were classified as SGA and 40 (4.2%) as FGR, with an overall rate of adverse perinatal outcome of 4.9%. At a fixed 10% false-positive rate (FPR), the detection rate of SGA by EFW, UtA-PI, CPR, UVBF and by a combination of Doppler variables (UtA-PI and CPR) and EFW was 59.2%, 10.5%, 13.7%, 3.2% and 61.0%, respectively. At a fixed 10% FPR, the detection rate of FGR by EFW, UtA-PI, CPR, UVBF and a combination of CPR and EFW centile was 83.3%, 13.9%, 27.8%, 13.9% and 88.6%, respectively. At a fixed 10% FPR, the detection rate of adverse perinatal outcome by EFW, UtA-PI, CPR and UVBF was 19.2%, 9.2%, 23.1% and 16.9%, respectively, while combining EFW with Doppler variables (including CPR and UVBF normalized by EFW) improved the detection rate to nearly 30%. Conclusion: In low-risk pregnancies, Doppler evaluation at 37 weeks' gestation did not improve the prediction of SGA and FGR compared with that given by EFW alone, however, combining Doppler variables with EFW improved the prediction of adverse perinatal outcomes given by these parameters alone, although not markedly.

There is no evidence that this epigenetic programming is occurring on systemic fetal arteries. In IUGR guinea pigs we studied the functional and epigenetic programming of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (Nos3 gene) in umbilical and systemic fetal arteries, addressing the role of oxidative stress in this process by maternal treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) during the second half of gestation. The present study suggests that IUGR endothelial cells have common molecular markers of programming in umbilical and systemic arteries. Notably, maternal treatment with NAC restores fetal growth by increasing placental efficiency and reverting the functional and epigenetic programming of eNOS in arterial endothelium in IUGR guinea pigs. Abstract: In humans, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with vascular dysfunction, oxidative stress and signs of endothelial programming in umbilical vessels. We aimed to determine the effects of maternal antioxidant treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on fetal endothelial function and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) programming in IUGR guinea pigs. IUGR was induced by implanting ameroid constrictors on uterine arteries of pregnant guinea pigs at mid gestation, half of the sows receiving NAC in the drinking water (from day 34 until term). Fetal biometry and placental vascular resistance were followed by ultrasound throughout gestation. At term, umbilical arteries and fetal aortae were isolated to assess endothelial function by wire-myography. Primary cultures of endothelial cells (ECs) from fetal aorta, femoral and umbilical arteries were used to determine eNOS mRNA levels by quantitative PCR and analyse DNA methylation in the Nos3 promoter by pyrosequencing. Doppler ultrasound measurements showed that NAC reduced placental vascular resistance in IUGR (P < 0.05) and recovered fetal weight (P < 0.05), increasing fetal-to-placental ratio at term (∼40%) (P < 0.001). In IUGR, NAC treatment restored eNOS-dependent relaxation in aorta and umbilical arteries (P < 0.05), normalizing eNOS mRNA levels in EC fetal and umbilical arteries (P < 0.05). IUGR-derived ECs had a decreased DNA methylation (∼30%) at CpG −170 (from the transcription start site) and this epigenetic signature was absent in NAC-treated fetuses (P < 0.001). These data show that IUGR-ECs have common molecular markers of eNOS programming in umbilical and systemic arteries and this effect is prevented by maternal treatment with antioxidants. © 2016 The Authors.

Corneal volume (CV) is a representative parameter of corneal morphology, and it can fully reflect corneal thickness and tissue distribution. Objective: This study was to investigate the correlation between volumetric corneal changes and corneal biomechanical properties after small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE). Methods: A prospective series cases-observational study was carried out. This study protocol was approved by Ethic Committee of Tianjin Eye Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to entering the cohort. Sixty-seven right eyes of 67 myopia or myopic astigmatism patients who received SMILE in Tianjin Eye Hospital from June 2014 to July 2015 were included in this study. Before and 3 months after surgery, the CV at 3, 3-5, 5-7 and 7-10 mm (CV3, CV3-5, CV5-7, CV7-10) was measured by Pentacam anterior segment analysis system, and corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) were obtained by ocular response analyzer (ORA). The changes of CV (ΔCV), CH (ΔCH) and CRF (ΔCRF) were calculated, and the correlations between ΔCV and ΔCH or ΔCRF were analyzed. Results: CV3, CV3-5 and CV5-7 values after SMILE were significantly lower than those before SMILE (t=36.24, 20.38, 16.17, all at P< 0.001). The CH values before and after SMILE were (10.06±1.11)mmHg and (8.10±1.05)mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa), and the CRF values before and after SMILE were (10.40±1.38)mmHg and (6.91±1.19)mmHg, respectively, showing significant reduces after SMILE than before SMILE (t=16.71, 27.41, both at P<0.001). Positive correlations were seen between the CV values at different corneal areas and CH value or CRF value. Moderate positive correlations were found between CV3 and CH or CRF (r=0.571, 0.569; both at P<0.001) before surgery, and 3 months after surgery, a weak positive correlation was seen between ΔCV3 and ΔCH (r=0.394, P<0.001) or a moderate positive correlation between ΔCV3 and ΔCRF (r=0.501, P<0.001). Conclusions: The CV value is gradually increased from the central cornea to periphery cornea. The CV change is associated with CH and CRF changes after SMILE, and CV3 probably is a useful parameter for the evaluation of corneal biomechanics after refractive surgery.

METHODS: Fifty-two patients(take right eye as study one) with hemodialysis that were diagnosed with chronic renal failure by nephrology in our hospital from January 2015 to December 2015 were collected. Fifty-two eyes were divided into four groups based on Shaffer classification combined with ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and gonioscopy manifestations: wide angle group, narrow angle group, extremely narrow group and close angle group. Venous blood was collected to get plasma colloid osmotic pressure before HD and within 60s after HD. IOP was measured with rebound intraocular pressure gauge in a supine positon approximately 30min before starting HD, 2h after HD begin and approximately 30min after HD ending. Approximately 30min before and after HD, central corneal thickness was measured with corneal endothelial cell counter, central anterior chamber depth and lens thickness were taken by A scan, angle opening distance, trabecular iris angle, iris thickness and ciliary body thickness were measured by UBM. RESULTS: Plasma osmotic pressure reduced after HD, the difference was statistically significant(t=3.04, P<0.05). The means of IOPs among three measurement points were not all the same(F=41.69, P<0.01). The IOP in 2h after HD had significant difference compared with before HD(P<0.01).The IOP in 30min after HD ending had significant difference compared with 2h after HD(P<0.01). The means of IOPs among three groups were not all the same (F=6.44, P<0.01). The IOP in extremely narrow angle group had significant difference compared with that in wide angle group and narrow angle group (P<0.05). Ciliary body thickness decreased after HD in every group, while only in wide angle group showed significant change after ending HD(t=2.61, P<0.05). Central corneal thickness, central anterior chamber depth, angle opening distance, trabecular iris angle and iris thickness decreased, while lens thickness increased after HD. But all these changes between before HD and after HD in every group had no significant difference. CONCLUSION: The influence of hemodialysis on IOP is related to the biometric structure of the anterior chamber. And extremely narrow angle is risk factor of elevated IOP during hemodialysis, narrow angle may be a risk factor. While patients with wide angle is relatively safe. We suggest to take ocular examination as early as possible for patients with hemodialysis, and focus on patients with narrow angle.

At the high end of the range, the Merz et al. formula is more accurate, but becomes less so in smaller fetuses. This study was designed to improve fetal weight estimation in fetuses >3500g by identifying the fetal biometric parameter providing the most reliable guidance to optimal formula selection. Materials and Methods,Regression analysis of 12032 pregnancies showed that multiplication of abdominal circumference by femur length (AC×FL) gave the best choice of appropriate formula: Hadlock for AC×FL <24600, Merz for those ≥24600. We then tested this rule, ('Zurich method'), prospectively in 4073 pregnancies, comparing it with the Hadlock, Merz and the Kehl formulas. Birth weights were merged into 7 categories (<1500 to ≥4000g, interval of 500g). The percentage error (PE) and absolute percentage error (APE) were calculated. Results,The PE using the Zurich method was lower in both >3500g groups than with the Hadlock formula alone (3500-3999g: 0.9% vs. -5.3%, >4000g: -3.2% vs. -8.6%), similar to that with the Merz formula alone, and lower than with the Kehl formulas (3500-3999g: -9.0% vs. -3.2%, >4000g: -5.1% vs. 0.9%). The Zurich method and Hadlock formula also shared the lowest PE in the <1500g group: 0.2% vs. 6.8% (Kehl) vs. 9.6% (Merz). In terms of APE the Zurich method performed almost as well as the Merz formula in the >4000g group, while sharing the lowest value with the Hadlock formula in the <1500g group (8.2% vs. 10.5% [Kehl], 23.6% [Merz]). Conclusion,The Zurich method uses a pivotal value of the biometry parameter AC×FL to switch between formulas and corrects for the errors of the Hadlock formula in fetuses ≥3500g and those of the Merz formula in fetuses <3500g. © 2017 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.","fetus; obstetrics; pregnancy","abdominal circumference; biometry; birth weight; error; femur; fetus; fetus weight; obstetrics; pregnancy; regression analysis"

Recent clinical use has indicated that the predictive quality might be suboptimal. This study compares the accuracy of three equations applied during the first (crown–rump length or bi-parietal diameter) and second trimesters (bi-parietal diameter or bi-parietal diameter combined with femur length). Material and methods: The accuracy of estimated delivery date was compared in 14 239 ultrasound exams using median deviations from actual birth date, proportion of postterms, births within ±seven days of estimated delivery date, accuracy variations depending on fetal size, alternative fetal measurements obtained on the same occasion, and menstrual age. Results: The bi-parietal diameter and crown–rump length formulae overestimated pregnancy length by two and three days respectively, causing 7–8% of pregnancies to be labelled postterm. A combined bi-parietal diameter+femur length formula overestimated by one day, with 5.1% postterms. No significant difference was found in the proportion of births within ±seven days. Second trimester estimated delivery date assessment had larger median variations than did first trimester assessment and suffered from shifting deviations across fetal size. The comparison of different biometry formulae in the same individual demonstrated one day extra deviation for bi-parietal diameter and three days extra deviation for crown–rump length compared with the combined bi-parietal diameter+femur length formula. Conclusions: The algorithms and dating occasions tested seem inappropriate for the present 280-day term definition. Alternative formulae ought to be sought, and the assumed duration of pregnancy reconsidered; 283 days corresponds to the observed pregnancy length calculated from last menstrual period, and would better fit the observed results for first trimester ultrasound scans. © 2016 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology","bi-parietal diameter; crown–rump length; estimated date of delivery; femur length; fetal biometry; Gestational age; postterm pregnancy; quality assessment","adult; algorithm; biometry; cephalometry; comparative study; crown rump length; diagnostic imaging; female; femur; fetus echography; first trimester pregnancy; gestational age; human; obstetric delivery; practice guideline; pregnancy; procedures; second trimester pregnancy; Adult; Algorithms; Biometry; Cephalometry; Crown-Rump Length; Delivery, Obstetric; Female; Femur; Gestational Age; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Ultrasonography, Prenatal"

Methods In 74 patients undergoing cataract surgery, three repeated measurements of aphakic spherical equivalent (SE) were taken. All measurements were objectively graded for their quality and evaluated with the â € limits of agreement' approach. ORs were calculated and analysis of variance was applied. The intraocular lens (IOL) power that would have given the target refraction was back-calculated from manifest refraction at 3 months postoperatively. Regression analysis was performed to generate two aphakic SE-based formulae for predicting this IOL. The accuracy of the formulae was determined by comparing them to conventional biometry and published aphakia formulae. Results In 32 eyes, three consecutive aphakic measurements were successful. Objective parameters of IWA map quality significantly impacted measurement variability (p<0.05). The limits of agreement of repeated aphakic SE readings were +0.66 dioptre (D) and-0.69 D. Intraoperative biometry by our formula resulted in 25% and 53% of all cases ±0.50D and ±1.00 D within SE target, respectively. A second formula that took axial length (AL) into account resulted in improved ratios of 41% and 70%, respectively. Conclusions A reliable application of IWA to calculate IOL power during routine cataract surgery may not be feasible given the high rate of measurement failures and the large variations of the readings. To enable reliable IOL calculation from IWA, measurement precision must be improved and aphakic IOL formulae need to be fine-tuned.","Clinical Trial; Optics and Refraction","aberrometry; adult; aged; aphakia; biometry; eye refraction; female; human; intraoperative period; lens implant; lens implantation; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; phacoemulsification; physiology; procedures; prospective study; regression analysis; Aberrometry; Adult; Aged; Aphakia; Biometry; Female; Humans; Intraoperative Period; Lens Implantation, Intraocular; Lenses, Intraocular; Male; Middle Aged; Phacoemulsification; Prospective Studies; Refraction, Ocular; Regression Analysis"

To evaluate the features of extrafoveal retinoschisis (EFRS) in highly myopic eyes detected by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). METHODS. In this retrospective case series, 89 eyes of 65 patients with high myopia and coexisting EFRS were included. The participants underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination, including visual acuity, ocular biometry, refraction, and perimetry. Three-dimensional wide-field scans were obtained with SS-OCT, and en face images were reconstructed with custom software. En face OCT features of EFRS were determined by two ophthalmologists masked to clinical characteristics. The associations of EFRS subtypes with ocular biometry and other OCT changes were evaluated as well. RESULTS. In wide-field SS-OCT scans, EFRS was classified into three different types, the inner limiting membrane (ILM) detachment and inner and outer EFRS, according to the specific layer of the splitting. All these three types were most frequently distributed in the inferotemporal quadrant (71.2% for ILM detachment, 59.5% for inner EFRS, and 75.0% for outer EFRS). Inner limiting membrane detachment and inner EFRS were often adjacent to peripapillary atrophy. Outer EFRS tends to coexist with inner EFRS, as we did not observe any case with standalone outer EFRS or with coexisting with ILM detachment. Eyes with all three types combined had the longest axial length (29.1 6 1.26 mm, P = 0.003) and the greatest refractive error (13.0 6 2.86 diopters [D], P = 0.014). The incidence of retinal microfolds and breaks among subgroups was significantly different (P = 0.012 and 0.003, respectively). Staphyloma was associated with outer EFRS (30.6% with versus 7.6% without outer EFRS). CONCLUSIONS. Wide-field SS-OCT reveals the spatial distribution of retinoschisis outside the fovea, and associations with retinal vessels and other retinal landmark structures. Further observations on the longitudinal changes and functional damage would help lead to a better understanding of its mechanism and prognosis. © 2017 The Authors.","En face; Extrafoveal retinoschisis; High myopia; Optical coherence tomography","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; atrophy; biometry; Bruch membrane; child; controlled study; epiretinal membrane; eye axis length; female; human; incidence; inferior temporal cortex; major clinical study; male; middle aged; myopia; ophthalmologist; optic nerve; optical coherence tomography; perimetry; priority journal; refraction error; retina fovea; retinal inner plexiform layer; retinal nerve fiber layer thickness; retinoschisis; retrospective study; school child; visual acuity; young adult; complication; eye refraction; follow up; myopia; optical coherence tomography; pathology; pathophysiology; procedures; prospective study; reproducibility; retina blood vessel; retina fovea; retinoschisis; severity of illness index; three dimensional imaging; time factor; Adolescent; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Fovea Centralis; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Myopia; Prospective Studies; Refraction, Ocular; Reproducibility of Results; Retinal Vessels; Retinoschisis; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity; Visual Field Tests"

Study Design and Setting We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception until April 14, 2015, for NMAs of randomized controlled trials including at least four different interventions. Two reviewers independently screened potential studies, whereas data abstraction was performed by a single reviewer and verified by a second. Results A total of 456 NMAs, which included a median (interquartile range) of 21 (13–40) studies and 7 (5–9) treatment nodes, were assessed. A total of 125 NMAs (27%) were star networks; this proportion declined from 100% in 2005 to 19% in 2015 (P = 0.01 by test of trend). An increasing number of NMAs discussed transitivity or inconsistency (0% in 2005, 86% in 2015, P < 0.01) and 150 (45%) used appropriate methods to test for inconsistency (14% in 2006, 74% in 2015, P < 0.01). Heterogeneity was explored in 256 NMAs (56%), with no change over time (P = 0.10). All pairwise effects were reported in 234 NMAs (51%), with some increase over time (P = 0.02). The hierarchy of treatments was presented in 195 NMAs (43%), the probability of being best was most commonly reported (137 NMAs, 70%), but use of surface under the cumulative ranking curves increased steeply (0% in 2005, 33% in 2015, P < 0.01). Conclusion Many NMAs published in the medical literature have significant limitations in both the conduct and reporting of the statistical analysis and numerical results. The situation has, however, improved in recent years, in particular with respect to the evaluation of the underlying assumptions, but considerable room for further improvements remains. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Inconsistency; Indirect evidence; Meta-epidemiology; Mixed-treatment comparisons; Multiple interventions; Reporting","bibliographic database; clinical research; drug therapy; medical literature; medical research; network meta-analysis; priority journal; publication; publishing; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review (topic); bibliographic database; biometry; human; procedures; statistics and numerical data; Biometry; Databases, Bibliographic; Humans; Network Meta-Analysis"

In each data set, repeated random sampling of various sample sizes, from n = 100 up to n = 2,000, was performed 100 times at each sample size and the variability in estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, posttest probabilities, odds ratios, and risk/prevalence ratios for each sample size was calculated. Results There were very wide, and statistically significant, differences in estimates derived from contingency tables from the same data set when calculated in sample sizes below 400 people, and typically, this variability stabilized in samples of 400–600 people. Although estimates of prevalence also varied significantly in samples below 600 people, that relationship only explains a small component of the variability in these statistical parameters.

Study Design and Settings Different methods for determining minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) are reviewed, applied to practical examples (pain score differences in knee osteoarthritis), and further developed. Their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages are illustrated and discussed. Results Empirical score differences between verum and placebo become statistically significant if sample sizes are sufficiently large. MCIDs, by contrast, are defined by patients’ perceptions. MCIDs obtained by the most common “mean change method” can be expressed as absolute or relative scores, as different ES parameters, and as the optimal cutoff point on the receiver operating characteristic curve. They can further be modeled by linear and logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusion Absolute and relative MCIDs are easy to interpret and apply to data of investigative studies. MCIDs expressed as effect sizes reduce bias, which mainly results from dependency on the baseline score. Multivariate linear and logistic regression modeling further reduces bias. Anchor-based methods use clinical/subjective perception to define MCIDs and should be clearly differentiated from distribution-based methods that provide statistical significance only. © 2016 The Authors","Confounding; Effect size; Minimal clinically important difference; Osteoarthritis; Outcome measurement; Receiver operating characteristics curve; Regression; Significance; Standardized mean difference; Statistics; WOMAC","Article; effect size; evaluation study; human; knee osteoarthritis; logistic regression analysis; minimal clinically important difference; nomenclature; outcome assessment; pain assessment; priority journal; probability; randomized controlled trial (topic); receiver operating characteristic; smallest detectable difference; standardized mean difference; statistical analysis; statistical parameters; Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index; biometry; epidemiology; questionnaire; sample size; Biometry; Epidemiologic Studies; Humans; Minimal Clinically Important Difference; ROC Curve; Sample Size; Surveys and Questionnaires"

Accumulating evidence suggests that HIV-infected patients exhibit marked changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, adenosine triphosphate generation, mitochondrial mass (MM), mitochondrial DNA, etc. However, mitochondrial toxicity in CD4+T and CD8+T cells caused by different levels of HIV progression and ART is poorly understood. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 97 ART-naïve HIVinfected patients with different CD4+T cell counts, 97 nucleosidereverse transcriptase inhibitors-exposed HIV-infected patients, and 25 HIV-negative subjects. MMP, ROS, and MM in CD4+T and CD8+T cells were assessed by flow cytometry. Results: In healthy subjects, the levels of MMP and MM in CD4+T cells were higher than those in CD8+T cells. HIV infection led to an increase in MM in CD4+T and CD8+T cells, but mainly influenced MMP in CD8+T cells and ROS accumulation in CD4+T cells. MM in CD4+T and CD8+T cells gradually increased after the loss of CD4+T cells. Although the dynamic changes in MMP in CD4+T cells were different from those in CD8+T cells during highly active ART, MM in both CD4+T and CD8+T cells was significantly decreased after 2 years of therapy, but increased again after 3 years. Conclusions: HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy both led to mitochondrial disturbances in CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells; however, the abnormal changes in mitochondrial parameters in CD4+T cells were different from those in CD8+T cells caused by HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","CD4+T cells; CD8+T cells; HAART; HIV; Mitochondrial disturbances","antiretrovirus agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; adult; biometry; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; female; flow cytometry; HIV Infections; human; male; middle aged; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrion; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; ultrastructure; volunteer; young adult; Adult; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Biometry; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Female; Flow Cytometry; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Middle Aged; Mitochondria; Reactive Oxygen Species; Volunteers; Young Adult"

Outdoor activity is one of the most important environmental factors for myopia control. Here we show that violet light (VL, 360–400 nm wavelength) suppresses myopia progression. First, we confirmed that VL suppressed the axial length (AL) elongation in the chick myopia model. Expression microarray analyses revealed that myopia suppressive gene EGR1 was upregulated by VL exposure. VL exposure induced significantly higher upregulation of EGR1 in chick chorioretinal tissues than blue light under the same conditions. Next, we conducted clinical research retrospectively to compare the AL elongation among myopic children who wore eyeglasses (VL blocked) and two types of contact lenses (partially VL blocked and VL transmitting). The data showed the VL transmitting contact lenses suppressed myopia progression most. These results suggest that VL is one of the important outdoor environmental factors for myopia control. Since VL is apt to be excluded from our modern society due to the excessive UV protection, VL exposure can be a preventive strategy against myopia progression. © 2016 The Authors","Axial length; Myopia; Outdoors; Refraction; Ultraviolet light; Violet light","calcifediol; early growth response factor 1; absorption spectroscopy; adolescent; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; biometry; blue light; child; contact lens; controlled study; disease course; EGR1 gene; eye axis length; eye refraction; eyeball; fluorescent lighting; gene expression; human; irradiation; Leghorn chicken; major clinical study; male; microarray analysis; myopia; nonhuman; photoreceptor cell; priority journal; radiation exposure; retina tissue; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; spectacles; TUNEL assay; ultraviolet radiation; upregulation; animal; cell line; chicken; disease model; gene expression profiling; light; myopia; phototherapy; sunlight; treatment outcome; ultraviolet radiation; Adolescent; Animals; Cell Line; Chickens; Child; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Progression; Eyeglasses; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Light; Male; Myopia; Phototherapy; Refraction, Ocular; Sunlight; Treatment Outcome; Ultraviolet Rays"

We tested if wolves select linear features and whether movement rates increased while travelling on linear features in north-eastern Alberta and north-western Saskatchewan using 5-min GPS (Global Positioning System) locations from twenty-two wolves in six packs. Wolves selected all but two linear feature classes, with the magnitude of selection depending on feature class and season. Wolves travelled two to three times faster on linear features compared to the natural forest. Increased average daily travelling speed while on linear features and increased proportion of steps spent travelling on linear features increased net daily movement rates, suggesting that wolf use of linear features can increase their search rate. Synthesis and applications. Our findings that wolves move faster and farther on human-created linear features can inform mitigation strategies intended to decrease predation on woodland caribou, a threatened species. Of the features that can realistically be restored, mitigation strategies such as silviculture and linear deactivation (i.e. tree-felling and fencing) should prioritize conventional seismic lines (i.e. cleared lines used for traditional oil and gas exploration) and pipelines, as they were selected by wolves and increased travelling speed, before low-impact seismic lines. © 2016 The Authors.

It is muscle of the anterior abdominal wall. It is thought to tense the linea alba. It has been used as a surgical landmark, source of muscle stem cells and in various surgical procedures. Aim: The aim of this study was to describe the morphometry and morphology of pyramidalis muscle in an adult Indian population and its correlation with the clinical significance. Materials and Methods: A cadaveric study on 25 formalin fixed cadavers (males-17, females-8) was conducted in context with prevalence, morphology and morphometry of pyramidalis muscle. Statistical analysis was done using the Chi-Square test and student’s t-test using SPSS version 23. Results: The pyramidalis muscle was present in 92% cases, usually bilaterally (72%) than unilaterally (20%) and more frequently in males (94.11%) than in females (87.5%). This study was conducted in Department of Anatomy, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India from August 2014 to August 2016. Bilateral asymmetry was reported. The mean length of the muscle in males and females was 52.21±14.32 and 50.13±13.62mm on the right and 53.97±15.11 and 51.22±13.78mm on the left side. No significant gender predominance existed on the right and left-sided pyramidalis lengths. The mean width of the right-sided pyramidalis in males and females was 18.35±5.15 and 17.05±4.99mm and the left-sided was 17.8±4.80 and 16.21±4.23mm without gender dimorphism. The mean thickness of the right-sided pyramidalis in males and females was 4.91±1.33 and 4.53±1.29mm and the left-sided 4.33±1.28 and 4.38±1.27mm without gender differences. The mean pyramidalis-puboumbilical index was 35.15±4.38%, 36.01±4.97% in males and females respectively. No anatomical variations with regard to origin and insertion were seen.

However, data validating this indexation of GEDV are scarce. Furthermore, it has been suggested to index GEDV to “predicted BSA” based on predicted body weight. Therefore, we aimed to identify biometric parameters independently associated with GEDV. We analyzed a database including 3812 TPTD measurements in 234 patients treated in the ICU of a German university hospital. GEDVI indexed to actual BSA was significantly lower than GEDVI indexed to predicted BSA (748 ± 179 vs. 804 ± 190 mL/m2; p &lt; 0.001). GEDV was independently associated with older age, male sex, height, and actual body weight. In a regression model for the estimation of GEDV, age and height were the most important parameters: Each year in age and each cm in height increased GEDV by 9 and 15 mL, respectively.

Usually, some sequence sites are ambiguously reconstructed, with two or more statistically plausible states. The extent to which the inferred functions and mutational effects are robust to uncertainty about the ancestral sequence has not been studied systematically. To address this issue, we reconstructed ancestral proteins in three domain families that have different functions, architectures, and degrees of uncertainty; we then experimentally characterized the functional robustness of these proteins when uncertainty was incorporated using several approaches, including sampling amino acid states from the posterior distribution at each site and incorporating the alternative amino acid state at every ambiguous site in the sequence into a single ""worst plausible case"" protein. In every case, qualitative conclusions about the ancestral proteins' functions and the effects of key historical mutations were robust to sequence uncertainty, with similar functions observed even when scores of alternate amino acids were incorporated. There was some variation in quantitative descriptors of function among plausible sequences, suggesting that experimentally characterizing robustness is particularly important when quantitative estimates of ancient biochemical parameters are desired. The worst plausible case method appears to provide an efficient strategy for characterizing the functional robustness of ancestral proteins to large amounts of sequence uncertainty. Sampling from the posterior distribution sometimes produced artifactually nonfunctional proteins for sequences reconstructed with substantial ambiguity. © The Author 2016.

However, the long-term refractive status of these children is largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to analyze the long-term refractive status of these children. Design Retrospective observational study. Methods We analyzed records of children (<7 years of age) who underwent cataract surgery with a primary IOL implantation and had completed follow-up to ≥7 years of age. Data were collected regarding demographics, etiology of cataract, method of undercorrection, and serial follow-up refractions. Prediction error was defined as refractive error minus emmetropia. The main outcome measure was prediction error at 7 years of age. Results Eighty-four eyes of 56 children (28 unilateral and 28 bilateral cases) met the study criteria. The median age at surgery was 3.3 years (interquartile range 2.7–5 years), and the median follow-up period was 3.75 years. At 7 years of age, the median absolute prediction was 1.5 diopters (interquartile range 0.75–2 diopters). Seven of 84 (8.3%) children achieved emmetropia while an equal proportion were myopic (45%) or hypermetropic (46%). Prediction error (adjusted for using both eyes) at 7 years of age was not significantly different in any group (P > .05). Maximum myopic shift was observed in children <2 years of age. Age at surgery was the only significant factor that influenced prediction error (â = −0.32; P = .001). Conclusion This study suggests that children undercorrected using guidelines suggested by Enyedi and associates may achieve an acceptable refractive error at 7 years of age. However, in children <2 years of age, more hypermetropia may be observed. More studies are needed to validate various methods of undercorrection and compare with other guidelines. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,"applanation tonometer; Article; biometry; cataract; cataract extraction; child; controlled study; demography; emmetropia; female; follow up; human; hypermetropia; keratometer; keratometry; lens implant; lens implantation; major clinical study; male; medical record review; myopia; observational study; ophthalmic ultrasound scanner; outcome assessment; partial coherence interferometry biometer; practice guideline; prediction; priority journal; validation study; adolescent; cataract; cataract extraction; complication; eye refraction; lens implant; myopia; pathophysiology; physiology; postoperative period; preschool child; pseudophakia; retrospective study; standards; visual acuity; Adolescent; Cataract; Cataract Extraction; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lenses, Intraocular; Male; Myopia; Postoperative Period; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Pseudophakia; Refraction, Ocular; Retrospective Studies; Visual Acuity"

Thus, numerous methods are available for legal authorities, although their efficiency can be discussed. For those reasons, we aimed to propose a new method, based on the biometric analysis of hand bones. 451 hand radiographs of French individuals under the age of 21 were retrospectively analyzed. This total sample was divided into three subgroups bounded by the relevant legal ages previously mentioned: 0–13, 13–18 and 18–21 years. On these radiographs, we numerically applied the osteometric board method used in anthropology, by including each metacarpal and proximal phalange of the five hand rays in the smallest rectangle possible. In that we can access their length and width information thanks to a measurement protocol developed precisely for our treatment with the ORS Visual® software. Then, a statistical analysis was performed from these biometric data: a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) evaluated the probability for an individual to belong to one of the age group (0–13, 13–18 or 18–21); and several multivariate regression models were tested for the establishment of age estimation formulas for each of these age groups. The mean Correlation Coefficient between chronological age and both lengths and widths of hand bones is equal to 0.90 for the total sample. Repeatability and reproducibility were assessed. The LDA could more easily predict the belonging to the 0–13 age group. Age can be estimated with a mean standard error which never exceeds 1 year for the 95% confidence interval. Finally, compared to the literature, we can conclude that estimating an age from the biometric information of metacarpals and proximal phalanges is promising. © 2016","Age estimation; Biometry; Forensic anthropology; Hand bones; Radiographs; Skeletal age",

Methods: Thirty subjects with healthy and phakic eyes were included in this study, and only one eye per participant was analysed. Each eye was measured five times with the IOLMaster 700 swept-source optical biometer (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany). Axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), central corneal thickness (CCT), lens thickness (LT), white-to-white (WTW), and K1 and K2 keratometric readings were evaluated. The repeatability of swept-source biometry was evaluated on the basis of five measurements captured for each patient. Results: The repeatability limits for the axial measurements AL, ACD, CCT, and LT were 0.03, 0.07, 0.004, and 0.11 mm, respectively. For the WTW distance and both keratometry readings, the repeatability limits were 0.20, 0.06, and 0.05 mm, respectively. The AL resulted in the lowest coefficient of variation, and the LT had the highest one. The spherical equivalent showed statistically significant negative correlations with the AL and ACD. Conclusion: Swept-source optical biometry showed high repeatability performance for all biometric parameters in healthy eyes, where the correlation between the spherical equivalent and AL showed the strongest value. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Anterior chamber depth repeatability; Anterior segment repeatability; Axial length repeatability; Corneal thickness repeatability; IOLMaster 700; Lens repeatability",

Methods The data collected included clinical factors (age, sex, history of vitrectomy) and biometry factors (axial length [AL], anterior chamber depth [ACD], lens thickness, white-to-white [WTW] distance) that might affect actual lens position. Each patient had optical low-coherence reflectometry biometry (Lenstar) preoperatively and 1 month postoperatively. The actual lens position was measured as the postoperative position of the center of the intraocular lens (IOL). Patients were stratified into 3 groups by type of IOL: Acrysof SN60WF or SN6AT (Group 1), Tecnis ZCB00 or ZCT (Group 2), and Asphina 409 MV (Group 3). Results The study comprised 168 eyes (mean age 73.3 years ± 9.8 [SD]). The mean actual lens position was 4.88 ± 0.29 mm, 5.01 ± 0.29 mm, and 5.05 ± 0.32 mm in Group 1 (n = 67 eyes), Group 2 (n = 52 eyes), and Group 3 (n = 49 eyes), respectively.

A statistically significant correlation between axial length and scleral radius (R2 = 0.957, p &lt; 0.001) was observed. Moreover, corneal radius (R2 = 0.420, p &lt; 0.001), anterior chamber depth (R2 = 0.141, p = 0.039) and white-to-white corneal diameter (R2 = 0.146, p = 0.036) have also shown statistically significant correlations with the scleral radius. Lastly, no correlation was observed comparing scleral radius to the central corneal thickness (R2 = 0.047, p = 0.161). Conclusions Three-dimensional topography of anterior eye acquired with Eye Surface Profiler together with a given estimate of the axial length, can be used to calculate the scleral radius with high precision. © 2016 British Contact Lens Association","Anterior eye topography; Fourier domain profilometer; Scleral contact lenses; Scleral curvature","adult; anatomy and histology; anterior eye segment; computer assisted diagnosis; female; human; keratometry; male; procedures; reproducibility; sclera; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; Adult; Anterior Eye Segment; Corneal Topography; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Reproducibility of Results; Sclera; Sensitivity and Specificity"

Methods Three consecutive measurements of the right eye of 102 subjects were acquired by the Aladdin (V.1.1.3) and the Lenstar (V.1.0.3), respectively, with a random order of which biometer to use first. Parameters compared included axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), flat keratometry (Kf), steep keratometry (Ks), mean keratometry (Km), J0, J45 and white-to-white (WTW) distance. Intraocular lens (IOL) power formulas included SRK/T (Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff/Theoretical), Holladay 1, Hoffer Q and Haigis. Repeatability (Sr), repeatability limit (r) and Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LoA) were calculated. Results Sr was marginally better with the Lenstar for AL (0.02 mm), ACD (0.02 mm) and WTW distance (0.07 mm), but Sr was marginally better with the Aladdin for Kf (0.10 dioptre (D)), J0 (0.07 D) and J45 (0.06 D). In terms of agreement, the mean difference was small and non-statistically significant between the two devices for ACD, Ks and J45. The mean difference for Kf, Km, J0 and WTW distance were all statistically significantly lower with the Aladdin than the Lenstar for the exception of WTW distance. The Bland-Altman LoA displayed narrow ranges implying good agreement with the exception for WTW distance. For IOL formulas, the mean difference was very small and not statistically significantly different. The LoA were narrow (within 0.50 D), implying acceptable use of each device interchangeably. Conclusions High levels of repeatability and agreement were found between the Aladdin and Lenstar suggesting that the devices may be used interchangeably in normal eyes with refractive error. © 2017 by the BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.",,

Design: Cohort study. Participants: Twenty eight young healthy volunteers with a mean age of 27.75 years. Methods: Volunteers underwent water drinking test with drinking water 20 ml/kg in 5 minutes after 2 hours fasting. Measurements of choroidal thickness, IOP, and ocular biometry were taken before and after water drinking 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min. Enhanced Depth Imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) was used to measure choroidal thickness at the fovea. IOP was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. Ocular biometric measures were collected using A scan ultrasound. The data of one eye of each volunteer were analyzed. Main Outcome Measures: IOP, chroid thickness, axial length, anterior chamber depth, vitreous thickness, lens thickness. Results: After water drinking 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, the IOP was 14.51±2.60, 17.59±2.44, 17.19±2.78, 15.46±2.45 mmHg, respectively (P<0.001). After water drinking 30 min anterior chamber depth shallowed (P=0.04), after water drinking 60 min axial length shortened (P=0.02) and vitreous length thickness shortened (P=0.04). There was statistically significant difference. However, there was no significant difference in the mean choroidal thickness (P=0.935). Before water dringking and after water drinking 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, the choroid thickness was 330.79±84.81, 340.00±91.97, 336.57±92.93, 334.86±85.63, 338.43±96.86 μm, respectively (P=0.935). Conclusion: There is a significant increase in IOP from water drinking test. The axial length become shorter, the anterior chamber depth become shallow and the vitreous thickness become shorter, and the lens thickness and the choroid thickness have no significant changes.

The EVERREST Prospective Study has been designed to characterise the natural history of pregnancies affected by severe early onset FGR and establish a well phenotyped bio-bank. The findings will provide up-to-date information for clinicians and patients and inform the design and conduct of the EVERREST Clinical Trial: a phase I/IIa trial to assess the safety and efficacy of maternal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene therapy in severe early onset FGR. Data and samples from the EVERREST Prospective Study will be used to identify ultrasound and/or biochemical markers of prognosis in pregnancies with an estimated fetal weight (EFW) &lt;3rd centile between 20+0 and 26+6 weeks of gestation. Methods: This is a 6 year European multicentre prospective cohort study, recruiting women with a singleton pregnancy where the EFW is &lt;3rd centile for gestational age and &lt;600 g at 20+0 to 26+6 weeks of gestation. Detailed data are collected on: maternal history; antenatal, peripartum, and postnatal maternal complications; health economic impact; psychological impact; neonatal condition, progress and complications; and infant growth and neurodevelopment to 2 years of corrected age in surviving infants. Standardised longitudinal ultrasound measurements are performed, including: fetal biometry; uterine artery, umbilical artery, middle cerebral artery, and ductus venosus Doppler velocimetry; and uterine artery and umbilical vein volume blood flow. Samples of maternal blood and urine, amniotic fluid (if amniocentesis performed), placenta, umbilical cord blood, and placental bed (if caesarean delivery performed) are collected for bio-banking. An initial analysis of maternal blood samples at enrolment is planned to identify biochemical markers that are predictors for fetal or neonatal death. Discussion: The findings of the EVERREST Prospective Study will support the development of a novel therapy for severe early onset FGR by describing in detail the natural history of the disease and by identifying women whose pregnancies have the poorest outcomes, in whom a therapy might be most advantageous. The findings will also enable better counselling of couples with affected pregnancies, and provide a valuable resource for future research into the causes of FGR.

Methods: Patients with ocular hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma who had been treated with PGA were included in the study. Anterior segment measurements including central corneal thickness (CCT), keratometry, anterior chamber depth (ACD) and white-to-white (WTW) corneal diameter obtained with the optic low-coherent reflectometer (LenStar LS-900, Haag-Streit AG, Switzerland) and with the Scheimpflug system (Pentacam; Oculus, HR) were compared. In order to compare LenStar and Pentacam measurements, paired sample t test and ‘Bland–Altman’ plot were used in the statistical analysis. Results: Twenty-two female (59.5%) and 15 male (40.5%) totally 37 cases with newly diagnosed glaucoma were included in the study. Anterior segment parameter measurements obtained with both the LenStar and the Pentacam were significantly correlated for right and left eyes, so the right eye values were used in statistical analysis. WTW and ACD values measured with LenStar were statistically significantly higher than those measured with Pentacam (p: 0.0001, p: 0.0001, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between the CCT values measured by the two devices (p: 0.217). Conclusion: There was a statistically significant difference between the mean values of ACD and WTW measured with the LenStar and Pentacam. These biometric devices should not be used interchangeably. It should be appropriate to use the same device on follow-up of glaucoma patients. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Anterior segment; Biometry; Glaucoma; LenStar; Pentacam; Scheimpflug",

This has a significant impact on short and long term maternal and infant health outcomes, and the intergenerational effects of obesity are now a major public health problem globally. Areas covered: There are two major pathways contributing to fetal growth. Glucose and insulin directly affect growth, while other substrates such as leptin, adiponectin and insulin-like growth factors indirectly influence growth through structural and morphological effects on the placenta, uteroplacental blood flow, and regulation of placental transporters. Advances in ultrasonography over the past decade have led to interest in the prediction of the fetus at risk of overgrowth and adiposity utilizing both standard ultrasound biometry and fetal body composition measurements. However, to date there is no consensus regarding the definition of fetal overgrowth, its reporting, and clinical management. Expert commentary: Maternal dietary intervention targeting the antenatal period appear to be too late to sufficiently affect fetal growth. The peri-conceptual period and early pregnancy are being evaluated to determine if the intergenerational effects of maternal obesity can be altered to improve newborn, infant and child health. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adiposity; fetal body composition; fetal growth; Obesity; pregnancy","adiponectin; glucose; insulin; leptin; somatomedin; adipose tissue; body composition; female; fetus; fetus echography; fetus growth; first trimester pregnancy; human; inflammation; large for gestational age; macrosomia; maternal obesity; meta analysis (topic); multicenter study (topic); placenta; placenta circulation; pregnant woman; prenatal care; prenatal period; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review (topic)"

Results before injection and 1 month after the first and third injections were compared. Results: The groups were matched for age (p = 0.11) and gender (p = 0.32). There was no significant difference in endothelial cell count (IVB group, p = 0.66; IVR group, p = 0.74), pleomorphism (IVB group, p = 0.44; IVR group, p = 0.88) and polymegathism (IVB group, p = 0.21; IVR group, p = 0.24) before injection or 1 month after the first and third injections. There was also no difference in central corneal thickness (IVB group, p = 0.15; IVR group, p = 0.58) before injection or 1 month after the first and third injections. Conclusion: Monthly 1.25 mg/0.05 ml IVIs of bevacizumab or 0.5 mg/0.05 ml of ranibizumab for three consecutive months in the treatment of diabetic macular edema does not affect corneal morphology and has no harmful effects on the endothelium. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bevacizumab; corneal endothelial count; diabetic macular edema; ranibizumab; specular microscopy; vascular endothelial growth factor","angiogenesis inhibitor; bevacizumab; ranibizumab; aged; anatomy and histology; controlled study; cornea endothelium; cytology; diabetic retinopathy; drug effects; female; human; intravitreal drug administration; macular edema; male; middle aged; randomized controlled trial; Aged; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Bevacizumab; Diabetic Retinopathy; Endothelium, Corneal; Female; Humans; Intravitreal Injections; Macular Edema; Male; Middle Aged; Ranibizumab"

The scale and complexity of zebrafish assays are limited by the need to manually treat and serially screen animals, and recent technological advances have focused on automation and improving throughput. Here, we use optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCT-A) to perform noninvasive, in vivo imaging of retinal vasculature in zebrafish. OCT-A summed voxel projections were low pass filtered and skeletonized to create an en face vascular map prior to connectivity analysis. Vascular segmentation was referenced to the optic nerve head (ONH), which was identified by automatically segmenting the retinal pigment epithelium boundary on the OCT structural volume. The first vessel branch generation was identified as skeleton segments with branch points closest to the ONH, and subsequent generations were found iteratively by expanding the search space outwards from the ONH. Biometric parameters, including length, curvature, and branch angle of each vessel segment were calculated and grouped by branch generation. Despite manual handling and alignment of each animal over multiple time points, we observe distinct qualitative patterns that enable unique identification of each eye from individual animals. We believe this OCT-based retinal biometry method can be applied for automated animal identification and handling in high-throughput organism-level pharmacological assays and genetic screens. In addition, these extracted features may enable high-resolution quantification of longitudinal vascular changes as a method for studying zebrafish models of retinal neovascularization and vascular remodeling. © 2017 SPIE.","Angiography; Biometry; Optical coherence tomography; Retinal vascular imaging; Zebrafish","Aldehydes; Angiography; Animals; Automation; Biomedical signal processing; Eye protection; Feature extraction; Iterative methods; Low pass filters; Ophthalmology; Tomography; Automated feature extraction; Biometry; Retinal neovascularization; Retinal pigment epithelium; Unique identifications; Vascular imaging; Vascular segmentations; Zebrafish; Optical tomography"

Setting Private practice, Recife, Brazil. Design Retrospective comparative study. Methods Cataract patients who had biometric measurements with the new biometer and the reference biometer were included in the study. Comparisons were performed for axial length (AL), keratometry (K), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and IOL power calculation to reach emmetropia with an Acrysof SN60WF IOL using the Haigis formula. The Pearson correlation coefficient and the 95% limits of agreement (LoA) were calculated. The paired Student t test and the Wilcoxon test were used to assess differences between devices. Results Eighty-eight eyes (88 patients) were studied. Both biometers provided statistically similar mean IOL power to reach emmetropia, AL, keratometry, and ACD measurements (P > .05). The differences in these variables did not vary as their mean values increased, and there was a strong positive correlation between the values obtained by both devices for each variable. The 95% LoA values for AL, mean keratometry, ACD, and IOL power were 0.27 mm, 1.08 diopters (D), 0.66 mm, and 1.56 D, respectively. Conclusions The 2 devices were comparable with regard to mean IOL power, mean AL, K, and ACD measurements.

The red blood cell count (RBC) and GLC wasconducted in a Neubauer chamber, the hemoglobin level (HGB) was supplied by the cyanmethemoglobin method and the hematocrit (HCT) was obtained by the microhematocrit technique. Based on the RBC, the hematimetric were mathematically established. Body biometrywere also evaluated: a) body mass (BM, g); b) maximum dimensions of the carapace [length(MLC, cm) and width (MWC, cm)]; c) maximum dimensions of plastron [length (MLP, cm)and width (MWP, cm)]; d) total length of tail (TLT, cm); e) linear length from the base of thetail to the cloacal orifice (LPrC, cm); f) linear length from the cloacal orifice to the extremityof the tail (LPoC, cm). T. scripta elegans showed higher values (P<0.05) for biometrics, while TLT and LPrC were higher (P<0.05) in T. dorbignyi. The hematological values did not differ(P>0.05) among species. The results show that most of the variation found between T. scripta elegans and T. dorbignyi is explained by the biometric variables and that some hematologic correlations characterize interspecies differences. It was conclude that the results shedlight on benchmarks for these species kept in captivity in the northeastern semi-arid regionand serve as a model for intra and interspecies comparative physiology.","Body biometry; Emydidae; Hematology; Red cell indices; Reptiles; Testudines; Trachemys dorbignyi; Trachemys scripta elegans",

Fifty-four healthy Santa Ines sheep were classified into three age groups: group 1 - 3 to 5 months (pre-pubertal); group 2 - 7 to 11 months (pubertal); and group 3 - 13 to 28 months (sexually mature). The averages of testicular biometry and bulbourethral gland biometry were different among age groups. The testicular parenchyma was homogeneous with low echogenicity (pre-pubertal group) and medium echogenicity (pubertal and sexually mature groups), suggesting that testicular echogenicity can be a helpful tool to identify the start of puberty. The accessory glands were heterogeneous with low echogenicity in all age groups. Correlations were high between weight, biometry of testis and of bulbourethral gland and echogenicity of the accessory glands, indicating that sexually mature rams with higher body development have larger testicles and larger glands. We recommend the use of testicular biometry as a complementary evaluation of the reproductive efficiency of Santa Ines rams.

Distinguishing these cryptospecies is essential for obtaining accurate population estimates for each, which is especially important in the case of the Iberian Chiffchaff due to its restricted distribution. We re-assessed the discriminant methods available in the literature and propose some alternative traits to distinguish both species. We used information from 24 morphological traits measured in c. 6,700 individuals of the two species trapped during the autumn migration period in Doñana National Park, Spain, between 2004 and 2015. Discriminatory methods available in the literature were unable to distinguish the two species efficiently. Despite some biometric differences, morphological measurements showed a high degree of overlap and so could not distinguish between Iberian and Common Chiffchaffs. The best discriminatory factor at our study site was the passage date, since 90% of Iberian Chiffchaffs have already departed when the first Common Chiffchaffs arrive. Those traits associated with migration, such as wing size and shape and fat deposits, were also able to discriminate the species, albeit weakly. This result fully concurs with the trans-Saharan migration of the Iberian Chiffchaff in contrast to the Common Chiffchaff, which chiefly winters in Mediterranean latitudes. In conclusion, biometric traits are useless for discriminating the two species and we do not recommend their use. A comprehensive examination of colouration and plumage seems to be the only reliable way of guaranteeing the correct identification of these species in the hand.","autumn migration; cryptic species; discriminant analysis; identification; morphology; Phylloscopus",

Malays are the major ethnicity in South East Asia. Data on the retinal microvasculature in Malays is limited, especially among children. We aim to evaluate the influence of ocular biometry on retinal vessel parameters in young Malay girls. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, hospital-based study involving 86 Malay girls aged 6 to 12 years old in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia from 2015-2016. Ocular examination, refraction, biometry, retinal photography, and anthropometric measurements were performed. The central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE), central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE) and overall fractal dimension (Df) were measured using validated computer-based methods (Singapore I vessel analyzer, SIVA version 3.0, Singapore). The associations of ocular biometry and CRAE, CRVE and Df were analyzed using multivariable analysis. Results: The mean CRAE, CRVE and Df in Malay girls were 171.40 (14.40) um, 248.02 (16.95) um and 1.42 (0.05) respectively. Each 1 mm increase in axial length was associated with a reduction of 4.25 um in the CRAE (p = 0.03) and a reduction of 0.02 in the Df (p = 0.02), after adjustment for age, blood pressure and body mass index. No association was observed between axial length and CRVE. Anterior chamber depth and corneal curvature had no association with CRAE, CRVE or Df. Conclusion: Axial length affects retinal vessel measurements. Narrower retinal arterioles and reduced retinal fractal dimension were observed in Malay girls with longer axial lengths. © 2017 Tai et al.

Methods: Random clustering sampling was used to identify adults aged 50 years and above in Xuhui and Baoshan districts of Shanghai. Refraction was determined by subjective refraction that achieved the best corrected vision based on monocular measurement. Ocular biometry was measured by IOL Master. The crystalline lens power of right eyes was calculated using modified Bennett-Rabbetts formula. Results: We analyzed 6099 normal phakic right eyes. The mean crystalline lens power was 20.34 ± 2.24D (range: 13.40-36.08). Lens power, spherical equivalent, and anterior chamber depth changed linearly with age; however, axial length, corneal power and AL/CR ratio did not vary with age. The overall prevalence of hyperopia, myopia, and high myopia was 48.48% (95% CI: 47.23%-49.74%), 22.82% (95% CI: 21.77%-23.88%), and 4.57% (95% CI: 4.05-5.10), respectively. The prevalence of hyperopia increased linearly with age while lens power decreased with age. In multivariate models, refractive error was strongly correlated with axial length, lens power, corneal power, and anterior chamber depth; refractive error was slightly correlated with best corrected visual acuity, age and sex. Conclusion: Lens power, hyperopia, and spherical equivalent changed linearly with age; Moreover, the continuous loss of lens power produced hyperopic shifts in refraction in subjects aged more than 50 years. © 2017 He et al.",,"adult; age; aged; anterior eye chamber depth; Article; axial length corneal radius ratio; best corrected visual acuity; biometry; Chinese; controlled study; corneal power; cross-sectional study; crystalline lens power; eye axis length; eye examination; female; human; hypermetropia; major clinical study; male; myopia; prevalence; refraction error; sex difference; suburban area; urban area; visual system parameters"

Our objective was to develop multivariable prediction models for small for gestational age combining clinical risk factors and biomarkers at 15±1 weeks' with ultrasound parameters at 20±1 weeks' gestation. Methods: Data from 5606 participants in the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) cohort study were divided into Training (n = 3735) and Validation datasets (n = 1871). The primary outcomes were All-SGA (small for gestational age with birthweight <10th customised centile), Normotensive-SGA (small for gestational age with a normotensive mother) and Hypertensive- SGA (small for gestational age with an hypertensive mother). The comparison group comprised women without the respective small for gestational age phenotype. Multivariable analysis was performed using stepwise logistic regression beginning with clinical variables, and subsequent additions of biomarker and then ultrasound (biometry and Doppler) variables. Model performance was assessed in Training and Validation datasets by calculating area under the curve. Results: 633 (11.2%) infants were All-SGA, 465(8.2%) Normotensive-SGA and 168 (3%) Hypertensive- SGA. Area under the curve (95% Confidence Intervals) for All-SGA using 15±1 weeks' clinical variables, 15±1 weeks' clinical+ biomarker variables and clinical + biomarkers + biometry/Doppler at 20±1 weeks' were: 0.63 (0.59-0.67), 0.64 (0.60-0.68) and 0.69 (0.66-0.73) respectively in the Validation dataset; Normotensive-SGA results were similar: 0.61 (0.57-0.66), 0.61 (0.56-0.66) and 0.68 (0.64-0.73) with small increases in performance in the Training datasets. Area under the curve (95% Confidence Intervals) for Hypertensive- SGA were: 0.76 (0.70-0.82), 0.80 (0.75-0.86) and 0.84 (0.78-0.89) with minimal change in the Training datasets. Conclusion: Models for prediction of small for gestational age, which combine biomarkers, clinical and ultrasound data from a cohort of low-risk nulliparous women achieved modest performance. Incorporation of biomarkers into the models resulted in no improvement in performance of prediction of All-SGA and Normotensive-SGA but a small improvement in prediction of Hypertensive-SGA. Our models currently have insufficient reliability for application in clinical practice however, they have potential utility in two-staged screening tests which include third trimester biomarkers and or fetal biometry. © 2017 McCowan et al.

Design: Retrospective observational case-control study Methods: Comparison of eyes of glaucoma patients undergoing cataract surgery after trabeculectomy (study group) with a matched group with medically controlled glaucoma (control group). Laser interferometry was used to obtain ocular biometry. We measured the difference between the expected and actual postoperative refraction using third-generation and fourth-generation intraocular lens (IOL) prediction formulae (Haigis, Holladay 2, Hoffer Q, and SRK-T). A residual difference of >1.0D of hyperopia or myopia was considered a ""refractive surprise."" Results: In total, 86 eyes (85 patients) were included, including 23 eyes (22 patients) in the study group and 63 eyes (63 patients) in the control group. The mean follow-up was 12.2 ±4.1 months. Eyes (n =13) with trabeculectomy and a preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP)r9mm Hg had significantly more large myopic surprises than the control group for all IOL formulae (P= 0.015 Haigis, P=0.003 Holladay 2, P=0.004 Hoffer Q, P=0.003 SRK-T). Eyes (n =10) with trabeculectomy and preoperative IOP>9mm Hg, however, did not have significantly more myopic errors than the control (P>0.05, all formulae). An ""IOP spike"" defined as a >50% rise in IOP from baseline within 1 month of cataract surgery in the subgroup with preoperative IOPr9 mm Hg (n =8) was associated with increased risk of large myopic surprise (3/8 subset vs. 1/63 control eyes for all formulae; P=0.004 Haigis, P=0.004 Holladay 2, P=0.001 Hoffer Q, P=0.004 SRK-T) as well as for large myopic and hyperopic surprises overall (4/8 subset vs. r2/63 depending upon formulae; all Pr0.001). Conclusions: Low posttrabeculectomy IOP (r9mm Hg) is a risk factor for significant myopic surprise when undergoing subsequent cataract surgery despite using laser interferometry to measure ocular biometry and later generation formulae to determine IOL power. In addition, an IOP spike was associated with a 50% risk for large refractive surprise in this low IOP group. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Materials and Methods: Patients with myopic (25 patients: 17 female, 8 male; median age 27 years, range 16-40 years) and hyperopic (31 patients: 19 female, 12 male; median age 20 years, range 13-41 years) anisometropic amblyopia were included. Eye examination included determination of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) with a Snellen chart, measurement of manifest and cycloplegic refraction after pupillary dilation, alternate cover testing, globe movement evaluation, A-scan biometry for axial length, biomicroscopy, fundus examination, and OCT scanning. Main outcome measures were spherical equivalence, BCVA, axial length, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, macular thickness, macular volume, and optic disc area. Results: In both myopic and hyperopic patients, the absolute value of the mean spherical equivalence was significantly greater in the amblyopic than non-amblyopic eyes, and the mean BCVA was significantly less in the amblyopic than the non-amblyopic eyes. In both myopic and hyperopic patients, there were no significant differences in mean RNFL thickness, macular thickness, macular volume, axial length, or optic disc area between amblyopic and non-amblyopic eyes.

Methods: Ocular biometry was measured by the LenStar biometer (Haag-Streit, Switzerland) in response to zero, 3.00 and 4.50 D accommodative stimuli in 35 emmetropes and 37 myopes, aged 18 to 60 years. All results were corrected to reduce errors arising from the increase in crystalline lens thickness with accommodation. Accommodative responses were measured sequentially by the WAM 5500 Auto Ref/Keratometer (Grand Seiko, Hiroshima, Japan). Results: Axial length increased significantly with accommodation (p<0.001), with a mean corrected increase in axial length of 2±18μm and 8±16μm observed at 3.00 and 4.50 D, respectively. The magnitude of accommodative change in axial length was not dependent on refractive error classification (p=0.959); however, a significant reduction in the magnitude and variance of axial length change was evident after 43 to 44 years of age (p<0.002). Conclusion: The negative association between transient increase in axial length and age, in combination with reduced variance of data after age 43 to 44 years, is consistent with a significant increase in posterior ocular rigidity, which may be influential in the development of presbyopia. © 2017 Optometry Australia.","Accommodation; Axial length; Biometry; Crystalline lens; Presbyopia",

In response, using swept-source optical biometry in prepresbyopic and presbyopic eyes, we investigated changes in ocular parameters and IOL power calculations attributable to cycloplegia. Design Cross-sectional study. Methods In 38 prepresbyopic and 42 presbyopic eyes, we measured pupil diameter, radius of corneal curvature values, central corneal thickness, WtW, ACD, LT, and axial length both before and after cycloplegia. We determined IOL power calculations with the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff/theoretical, Holladay 2, and Haigis formulas. To pinpoint the effect of cycloplegia, we recorded refractive predictions in pre- and postdilation conditions according to the same IOL power calculations, even if postdilation IOL power calculations had changed. Results With cycloplegia, pupil diameter changed significantly more in presbyopic eyes (P < .001). Central corneal thickness decreased in prepresbyopic eyes (P = .048), whereas WtW increased in presbyopic eyes (P = .02). In both groups, ACD and LT changed significantly (P < .001). IOL power calculations according to the Holladay 2 formula differed in prepresbyopic eyes (P = .042), and refractive predictions with the Holladay 2 and Haigis formulas differed significantly in prepresbyopic eyes (P = .043 and P = .022, respectively).

The final multivariate model found that fetal aIMT as well as fetal umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI), maternal age, maternal prepregnacy BMI, parity, and mean PI of maternal UtAs, assessed at ultrasound examination of 29 to 32 weeks' gestation, were significant and independent predictors for the development of gestational hypertension after 34 weeks' gestation. The area under the curve of the model was 81.07% (95% confidence interval, 75.83%-86.32%). A nomogram was developed starting from multivariate logistic regression coefficients. Late-gestational hypertension could be independently predicted by fetal aIMT assessment at 29 to 32 weeks' gestation, ultrasound Doppler waveforms, and maternal clinical parameters.

The study was conducted on major salivary glands of twenty-four buffalo foetuses as well as six neonatal buffalo calves. Three pairs of major salivary glands viz., parotid, mandibular and sublingual were distinguished during prenatal and neonatal life in the buffalo. The mandibular gland was the largest among the three major salivary glands in prenatal buffalo, which may be attributed to its early development among all the salivary glands. The sublingual gland was the smallest among the three major salivary glands in prenatal buffalo and measured about half the size of the mandibular gland. At 5.8 cm CVRL (54th day), the mandibular gland began to form an epithelial outgrowth into the mesenchyme, forming the floor of the mouth in the linguo-gingival groove. At 6 cm CVRL (55th day), the sublingual gland arose as a number of small epithelial thickenings in the linguogingival groove and each thickening formed its own canal. Grossly, the superior (polystomatic) and inferior (monostomatic) parts of the sublingual gland were distinguishable at 16.5 cm CVRL (102nd day). At 6.9 cm CVRL (60th day), the parotid gland was seen in the form of a small rod, extending dorsally from the lateral part of the oral cavity, just below and infront of the external ear and behind the facial nerve. Significant differences in the biometrical parameters of all major salivary glands between foetuses of Group I, II, III as well as neonatal buffalo were observed at P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.01 level. © 2017, Kasetsart University.

The materials for the analysis included the fingerprint cards obtained from 3570 Russians, 118 Kyrghyz, and 73 Uzbeks (men at the age from 14 to 25 years). We compared the data on the occurrence of different types of the papillary patterns. The significance of the differences was estimated with the use of the Student t-test. The comparative analysis of the papillary patterns showed that the Russians had the largest number of the arch patterns (8.2%) in their fingerprint cards whereas the Uzbeks had the lowest number (3.7%) of such patterns. The whorl patterns most frequently occurred in the fingerprint cards of the Kyrgyz (36.9%) whereas relatively few Russians exhibited this pattern (22.3%). Statistically significant differences were documented between the samples from the Russian and the Kyrgyz as well as from the Russians and the Uzbeks (p<0.01) whereas the difference between the Kyrgyz and the Uzbeks was insignificant (p>0.05). The list of 20 informative signs of the greatest diagnostic value is compiled taking into consideration the hand (right or left) and the sequential position of each finger. It is shown that the use of these signs makes it possible to distinguish between the «Russian» and «Kyrgyz» («Uzbek») papillary patterns on several fingers. Because the diagnostically significant combinations of the signs are known to occur but rarely, it is necessary to continue the search for the additional diagnostic traits in order to extend the sphere of practical applicability of the proposed method.Изучили папиллярные узоры пальцев рук русских, киргизов и узбеков с целью поиска дифференциально-диагностических критериев этнотерриториальной принадлежности.

Recent findings Corneal measurements and IOL calculations cannot be obtained accurately with the standard measuring technologies and formulas in patients with history of laser corneal refractive surgery; therefore a variety of methods and formulas, some of which required prerefractive surgery data, have been proposed to improve the accuracy of measurements and calculations. Formulas that do not rely on prerefractive data seem to be as accurate as those that do; therefore the lack of prerefractive data no longer presents an obstacle for accurate IOL selection in these patients. Summary Postrefractive patients undergoing cataract extraction and IOL implantation should have corneal measurements and IOL calculations that take into account and compensate for the limitations in accurate measurements and calculations. IOL selection should also aim to compensate for induced spherical aberration according to the ablation pattern. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The new species Heterostegina matteuccii sp. nov., characterized by the combination of an advanced nepionic stage (i.e. very few operculine chambers) and a relatively small proloculus, is here described from the lower Oligocene Caltavuturo Formation of Portella Colla (Madonie Mts, Sicily, Italy). The same species is recorded also in the ‘Calcaire à astéries’ Formation of Illats (Northern Aquitaine, near Bordeaux, France). Biometrically, H. matteuccii sp. nov. does not fit within any known Neo-Tethyan lineage of Heterostegina from the Eocene to the Miocene, and hence is considered to be a member of a distinct phyletic lineage. The advanced nepionic stage of H. matteuccii sp. nov., however, calls for the existence of predecessors. The Priabonian (and possibly also earliest Oligocene) H. ocalana Cushman, 1921 from the American-Caribbean realm is here interpreted as the most probable ancestral form for the H. matteuccii lineage. Thus, an early Oligocene eastward transatlantic migration of this lineage may be inferred. New results of strontium isotope stratigraphy from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean are consistent with this hypothesis. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:CC54DB64-091D-4CDE-A6AB-6DC620F0FC23 © The Trustees of the Natural History Museum, London 2017.

Different atrazine application histories of soils impacted the kinetics of biomineralization but not the presence of catabolic genes of two atrazine degradative pathways (Trz and Atz). Biomineralization was based on the measurement of 14CO2 from [U-ring-14C]-atrazine in surface soil (0–7 cm) samples incubated in biometers. Aerobic atrazine biomineralization rate constants (k) varied in the range of 0.004–0.508 d−1 depending on the specific soil sample and glucose amendment. The corresponding k-values for anaerobic biometers ± nitrate, ferrihydrite or sulfate were 0.002–0.360 d−1. Glucose enhancement of atrazine biomineralization was not consistent. Aerobic enrichments from soil samples and in-situ incubated BioSep beads yielded mixed cultures, four of which were characterized by 16S rRNA gene amplification, cloning and sequencing. Twelve pure cultures were isolated from enrichments and they were primarily Arthrobacter spp. (10/12). The presence of eight atrazine catabolic genes representing two degradative pathways was investigated in seven bacterial isolates by PCR amplification and sequencing. Several combinations of atrazine catabolic genes were detected; each contained at least atzBC. A complete set of genes for the Atz pathway was not found among the isolates.

The subsequent lowering of the saturation state of CaCO3 may make the secretion of skeletons more problematic for marine calcifiers. As organisms that precipitate thin aragonite shells, thecosome pteropods have been identified as being particularly vulnerable to climate change effects. Coupled with their global distribution, this makes them ideal for use as sentinel organisms. Recent studies have highlighted shell dissolution as a potential indicator of ocean acidification; however, this metric is not applicable for monitoring pH changes in supersaturated basins. In this study, the novel approach of high resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning was used to produce quantitative 3-dimensional renderings pteropod shells to assess the potential of using this method to monitor small changes in shell biometrics that may be driven by climate change drivers. An ontogenetic analysis of the shells of Cavolinia inflexa and Styliola subula collected from the Mediterranean was used to identify suitable monitoring metrics. Modern samples were then compared to historical samples of the same species, collected during the Mediterranean leg of the Thor (1910) and Dana (1921) cruises to assess whether any empirical differences could be detected. Shell densities were calculated and scanning electron microscopy was used to compare the aragonite crystal morphology. pH for the collection years was hind-cast using temperature and salinity time series with atmospheric CO2 concentrations from ice core data. Historical samples of S. subula were thicker than S. subula shells of the same size from 2012 and C. inflexa shells collected in 1910 were significantly denser than those from 2012. These results provide a baseline for future work to develop monitoring techniques for climate change in the oceans using the novel approach of high-resolution CT scanning. © 2017 Howes et al.

Study subjects: Forty-one canine cadaver heads and one macerated dog skull. Procedures: Inion and nasion points were recognized in the macerated skull and used as landmarks for cranial length measure. Thirty cadavers classified as dolichocephalic, mesaticephalic and brachycephalic were distributed in three study groups. Anatomic references of the skull shapes were recognized and parameters measured: body weight (BW), cranial length (Lcr) and length of the periorbita (Lpo). Results were compared and statistical analyses were performed to find correlations between BW and the skull parameters. Contrast medium was injected in another 11 cadavers with a total volume calculated based on Lcr (10 cadavers) or BW (one cadaver) and then submitted to computerized tomography examination to compare techniques, estimate the capacity of the intraconal space of the periorbita and to illustrate practical implications. Results: There is a positive correlation between BW and Lpo (P &lt; 0.001) as well as between Lcr and Lpo (P &lt; 0.0001). Linear regression of the variable BW predicts only 71% of the variable Lpo (r2 = 0.71), whereas the variable Lcr predicts 88% (r2 = 0.88) of Lpo. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a mathematical relation between Lcr and Lpo. A method for calculating anesthetic solution volumes based on canine morphometric features is presented.

Design Reliability study. Methods A total of 377 eyes of 210 patients were scanned with the 3 biometers in a random order. For each biometer, the number of unobtainable axial length measurements was recorded and grouped as per the type and severity of cataract based on the Lens Opacities Classification System III by the same experienced ophthalmologist. The Bland-Altman limits-of-agreement (LoA) method was used to assess the agreement in axial length measurements between the 3 biometers. Results The failure rate was 0 eyes (0%) with the OA-2000, 136 eyes (36.07%) with the IOLMaster, and 51 eyes (13.53%) with the Aladdin. χ2 analyses indicated a significant difference in failure rate between all 3 devices (P &lt; .001). Logistic regression analysis highlighted a statistically significant trend of higher failure rates with increasing severity of nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular cataracts. Bland-Altman statistics indicated small mean differences and narrow LoA (OA-2000 vs IOLMaster −0.09 to 0.08 mm; OA-2000 vs Aladdin −0.10 to 0.07 mm; IOLMaster vs Aladdin −0.05 to 0.04 mm). Conclusions The OA-2000, a new SSOCT-based biometer, outperformed both the IOLMaster and Aladdin biometers in very advanced cataracts of various morphologies. The use of SSOCT technology may be the reason for the improved performance of the OA-2000 and may lead to this technology becoming the gold standard for the measurement of axial length. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,"adult; aged; Article; biometry; cataract; controlled study; disease classification; eye axis length; female; human; interferometry; major clinical study; male; ophthalmologist; optical coherence tomography; optical low coherence interferometry; partial coherence interferometry; partial coherence interferometry biometer; priority journal; subcapsular cataract; swept source optical coherence tomography; anatomy and histology; biometry; cataract; comparative study; diagnostic error; eye axis length; follow up; interferometry; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; procedures; prospective study; reproducibility; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Axial Length, Eye; Biometry; Cataract; Diagnostic Errors; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Interferometry; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Tomography, Optical Coherence"

The infective juveniles of S. pwaniensis n. sp. are characterized by a body length of 978 μm (808-1131), distance from anterior end to excretory pore of 86 μm (80-95) and a tail length of 87 μm (75-95). The ratios a, c and E% of S. pwaniensis n. sp. are substantially lower than those of all other African 'glaseri' group members. The first-generation males of S. pwaniensis n. sp. can be distinguished by a large spicule length of 92 μm (80-97) and by the absence of the caudal mucron, while second-generation males possess a short spine-like mucron. First-generation females have a peg-like tail tip bearing three spine-like projections. Second-generation females can be recognized by a slightly protruding vulva and well-developed post-anal swelling. The new species is further characterized by sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and partial 28S regions of the ribosomal DNA.

This study aims to characterize the compositional and functional effects of several nutritional, neutraceutical, and pharmaceutical cardiovascular disease interventions on the gut microbiome, through metagenomic and metabolomic approaches. Apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice were fed for 24 weeks either high-fat/cholesterol diet alone (control, HFC) or high-fat/cholesterol in conjunction with one of three dietary interventions, as follows: plant sterol ester (PSE), oat β-glucan (OBG) and bile salt hydrolase-active Lactobacillus reuteri APC 2587 (BSH), or the drug atorvastatin (STAT). The gut microbiome composition was then investigated, in addition to the host fecal and serum metabolome. Results: We observed major shifts in the composition of the gut microbiome of PSE mice, while OBG and BSH mice displayed more modest fluctuations, and STAT showed relatively few alterations. Interestingly, these compositional effects imparted by PSE were coupled with an increase in acetate and reduction in isovalerate (p < 0. 05), while OBG promoted n-butyrate synthesis (p < 0.01). In addition, PSE significantly dampened the microbial production of the proatherogenic precursor compound, trimethylamine (p < 0.05), attenuated cholesterol accumulation, and nearly abolished atherogenesis in the model (p < 0.05). However, PSE supplementation produced the heaviest mice with the greatest degree of adiposity (p < 0.05). Finally, PSE, OBG, and STAT all appeared to have considerable impact on the host serum metabolome, including alterations in several acylcarnitines previously associated with a state of metabolic dysfunction (p < 0.05). Conclusions: We observed functional alterations in microbial and host-derived metabolites, which may have important implications for systemic metabolic health, suggesting that cardiovascular disease interventions may have a significant impact on the microbiome composition and functionality. This study indicates that the gut microbiome-modifying effects of novel therapeutics should be considered, in addition to the direct host effects. © The Author(s) 2017.","Apo-E-deficient; Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular disease; Metabolome; Microbiome","acylcarnitine; alkaline phosphatase; apolipoprotein E; atorvastatin; beta glucan; bile salt; butyric acid; cholesterol; cholesterol esterase; hydrolase; isovaleric acid; phytosterol; rifampicin; short chain fatty acid; STAT protein; trimethylamine; acetic acid derivative; acylcarnitine; atorvastatin; beta glucan; beta-glucan, (1-3)(1-4)-; butyric acid derivative; carnitine; cholesterol; cholesterol intake; probiotic agent; valeric acid derivative; animal experiment; animal model; Article; atherogenesis; atherosclerotic plaque scoring; biochemical analysis; biometry; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular disease assessment; cholesterol diet; controlled study; feces analysis; intestine flora; Lactobacillus reuteri; lipid diet; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; mass fragmentography; metabolic disorder; metabolome; metagenomics; microbiome; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; obesity; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; administration and dosage; analogs and derivatives; animal; atherosclerosis; blood; Cardiovascular Diseases; cholesterol intake; deficiency; dietary supplement; feces; metabolism; microbiology; Acetates; Animals; Apolipoproteins E; Atherosclerosis; Atorvastatin Calcium; beta-Glucans; Butyrates; Cardiovascular Diseases; Carnitine; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, Dietary; Diet, High-Fat; Dietary Supplements; Feces; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Lactobacillus reuteri; Male; Metabolome; Mice; Obesity; Pentanoic Acids; Probiotics"

We knocked down BI-1 in the sensitive dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) expressing neurons of Drosophila melanogaster to investigate its neuroprotective functions. We additionally sought to rescue the BI-1-induced phenotypes by co-expression with the pro-survival Buffy and determined the effect of BI-1 knockdown on the neurodegenerative a-synucleininduced Parkinson disease (PD) model. Methods:We used organismal assays to assess longevity of the flies to determine the effect of the altered expression of BI-1 in the Ddc-Gal4-expressing neurons by employing two RNAi transgenic fly lines. We measured the locomotor ability of these RNAi lines by computing the climbing indices of the climbing ability and compared them to a control line that expresses the lacZ transgene. Finally, we performed biometric analysis of the developing eye, where we counted the number of ommatidia and calculated the area of ommatidial disruption. Results: The knockdown of BI-1 in these neurons was achieved under the direction of the Ddc-Gal4 transgene and resulted in shortened lifespan and precocious loss of locomotor ability. The co-expression of Buffy, the Drosophila anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologue, with BI-1-RNAi resulted in suppression of the reduced lifespan and impaired climbing ability. Expression of human a-synuclein in Drosophila dopaminergic neurons results in neuronal degeneration, accompanied by the agedependent loss in climbing ability.We exploited this neurotoxic system to investigate possible BI-1 neuroprotective function. The co-expression of a-synuclein with BI-1-RNAi results in a slight decrease in lifespan coupled with an impairment in climbing ability. In supportive experiments, we employed the neuron-rich Drosophila compound eye to investigate subtle phenotypes that result from altered gene expression. The knockdown of BI-1 in the Drosophila developing eye under the direction of the GMR-Gal4 transgene results in reduced ommatidia number and increased disruption of the ommatidial array. Similarly, the co-expression of BI-1-RNAi with Buffy results in the suppression of the eye phenotypes. The expression of a-synuclein along with the knockdown of BI-1 resulted in reduction of ommatidia number and more disruption of the ommatidial array. Conclusion: Knockdown of BI-1 in the dopaminergic neurons of Drosophila results in a shortened lifespan and premature loss in climbing ability, phenotypes that appear to be strongly associated with models of PD in Drosophila, and which are suppressed upon overexpression of Buffy and worsened by co-expression with a-synuclein. This suggests that BI-1 is neuroprotective and its knockdown can be counteracted by the overexpression of the pro-survival Bcl-2 homologue. © 2017 M'Angale & Staveley.","A-synuclein; Bax inhibitor-1; Buffy; Drosophila melanogaster; Model of Parkinson disease","alpha synuclein; Bax inhibitor 1; peptides and proteins; protein bcl 2; protein Buffy; unclassified drug; adult; aging; amino acid sequence; animal experiment; Article; bioinformatics; biometry; climbing; controlled study; Drosophila; field emission scanning electron microscopy; gel electrophoresis; genotype; lifespan; locomotion; longevity; male; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; phenotype; protein expression"

In this work, an experiment in a greenhouse was conducted over a 6-week period to investigate the effect of soil enrichment with ladle furnace slag on morpho-physiological parameters of Amaranthus paniculatus L. plants. Results showed that the addition of 5% (w/w) slag to soil did not alter the plant growth, highlighting a high tolerance to this slag concentration. Contrarily, plants cultivated in a soil with 10% (w/w) slag showed a marked reduction both in growth and biometric parameters. Moreover, plants grown on a slag-rich soil (20% w/w) highlighted a very low survival rate. This behaviour was confirmed by the biochemical and physiological investigations on chlorophyll a and b content, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence analyses. Metal(loid)s determination showed the accumulation of Ni, Se, Sn, As, Sb and Cd in 10% slag-treated plants, while revealed an increase in Ni, Cd, As and Pb in 5% slag-treated plants.

It was demonstrated that the natural conditions of Olsztyn permit cultivation of the examined cherry silverberry biotypes, although the yield was not high. The 01-1999 biotype from the Polish selection was characterized by a higher yield and weight of fruit, as well as by a higher fruit weight-to-stone weight ratio in comparison to biotypes selected in Belarus. The fruit of the examined biotypes also significantly differed in their chemical composition. Fruits of the 9-19-1996 biotype were characterized by high dry matter content, low acidity and a high sugar-to-acid ratio. The 9-24-1996 biotype fruits were characterized by the highest content of vitamin C. Both fruits and stones of cherry silverberry contained fat rich in n-3 and n-6 fatty acids. In cherry silverberry fruits, this ratio ranged from 1.2:1 to 1.4:1 in the pulp and from 1.4:1 to 1.8:1 in the stone.","Chemical composition; Cherry silverberry; Fatty acids; Fruit biometry; Yield",

It is well documented that LW piglets have lower growth performance, muscle accretion and poor carcass quality. However, little is known about the relations of birthweight with subsequent reproductive performance in gilts. This study investigated the effects of birthweight on reproductive tract and ovarian follicle development in 150-day-old gilts. Twenty eight female pigs of different birthweight ranges (high-HW: 1.8-2.2 kg; low-LW: 0.8-1.2 kg) from higher parity commercial sows were reared until 150 days of age, and their body weights were recorded at weaning, end of nursery and end of the grower-finisher phase. The animals were killed and their reproductive tracts collected for biometrical and histomorphometrical analysis. LW gilts showed significantly lower body weights and growth rates during all phases of production compared to their HW counterparts (p < .01). Most biometrical measurements of the reproductive tract were similar between the experimental groups, except vaginal length and the gonadossomatic index (relative ovarian weight), which were affected by birthweight class (p < .05). LW females also showed fewer medium size (3-5 mm; p < .01) ovarian follicles, pre-antral follicles (p < .07) and more atretic follicles per ovarian cortex area (p < .05). Therefore, besides the effects on post-natal growth performance, birthweight affects vaginal length and the follicular dynamics process, which may impair the reproductive performance of replacement gilts. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Birthweight; Follicular development; Gilts; Reproductive tract biometry",

Objective: We phenotyped daughters (n = 76) of mothers with PCOS and daughters (n = 80) from control mothers for reproductive and metabolic parameters characteristic of PCOS. Design, Setting, and Participants: We performed a matched case/control study at Penn State Hershey Medical Center that included non-Hispanic, white girls 4 to 17 years old. Intervention: We obtained birth history, biometric, ovarian ultrasounds, whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan for body composition, 2-hour glucose challenged salivary insulin levels, and two timed urinary collections (12 hours overnight and 3 hours in the morning) for gonadotropins and sex steroids. Main Outcome Measures: We measured integrated urinary levels of adrenal (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) and ovarian [testosterone (TT)] steroids. Other endpoints included integrated salivary insulin levels and urinary luteinizing hormone levels. Results: There were no differences in detection rates or mean levels for gonadotropins and sex steroids in timed urinary collections between PCOS daughters and control daughters, nor were there differences in integrated salivary insulin levels. Results showed that 69% of Tanner 4/5 PCOS daughters vs 31% of control daughters had hirsutism defined as a Ferriman-Gallwey score >8 (P = 0.04). There were no differences in body composition as determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry between groups in the three major body contents (i.e., bone, lean body mass, and fat) or in ovarian volume between groups.

In such cases failure to eliminate the effect of this theme can result in the generation of a variety of unusual, unexpected, and seemingly counterintuitive multivariate data-analysis results. This effect was first identified by Felix Klein who described certain aspects of this issue in a 1926 article with specific focus on the analysis of the logarithmic spirals of ammonite shells. However, this problem is much more general than Klein (1926) alluded to and can potentially affect, to a greater or lesser extent depending on the range of shape variation included in the sample, any dataset collected from any sample and represented by any set of metric variables. Fortunately, it is a simple matter to correct morphometric data for the effect of dominant geometric themes. This normalization has long been a part of the geometric approach to morphometric analysis. But it can and should be used in a wider variety of data-analysis contexts. The significance of, and discussion of solutions for, the dominant geometric theme effect are presented here primarily in the context of differential geometries of ammonite microconch and macroconch dimorphs. © 2017.","Ammonites; Biometry; Eigenanalysis; Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Systematics",

But this focus often frustrates the organismal biologist, mainly because principal component analysis (PCA) is not aimed at scientific interpretability of the loading patterns actually uncovered. The difficulty of making biological sense of a PCA is heightened by aspects of the shape coordinate setting that further diverge from our intuitive expectations of how morphometric measurements ought to combine. More than 50 years ago one of our sister disciplines, psychometrics, managed to build an algorithmic route from principal component analysis to scientific understanding via the toolkit generally known as factor analysis. This article introduces a modification of one standard factor-analysis approach, Henry Kaiser's varimax rotation of 1958, that accommodates two of the major differences between the GMM context and the psychometric context for these approaches: the coexistence of ""general"" and ""special"" factors of form as adumbrated by Sewall Wright, and the typical loglinearity of partial warp variance as a function of bending energy. I briefly explain the history of principal components in biometrics and the contrast with factor analysis, introduce the modified varimax algorithm I am recommending, and work three examples that are reanalyses of previously published cranial data sets. A closing discussion emphasizes the desirability of superseding PCA by algorithms aimed at anthropological understanding rather than classification or ordination. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","BE-PwV plot; Geometric morphometrics; Principal components; Shape coordinates; Varimax factor rotation","biometry; classification; expectation; factor analysis; human; morphometry; principal component analysis; psychometry; sister; varimax rotation"

Organism biomass is one of the most important variables in ecological studies, making biomass estimations one of the most common laboratory tasks. Biomass of small macroinvertebrates is usually estimated as dry mass or ash-free dry mass (hereafter `DM' vs. `AFDM') per sample; a laborious and time consuming process, that often can be speeded up using easily measured and reliable proxy variables like body size or wet (fresh) mass. Another common way of estimating AFDM (one of the most accurate but also time-consuming estimates of biologically active tissue mass) is the use of AFDM/DM ratios as conversion factors. So far, however, these ratios typically ignore the possibility that the relative mass of biologically active vs. non-active support tissue (e.g., protective exoskeleton or shell)-and therefore, also AFDM/DM ratios-may change with body size, as previously shown for taxa like spiders, vertebrates and trees. Methods. We collected aquatic, epibenthic macroinvertebrates (&gt;1 mm) in 32 shallow bays along a 360 km stretch of the Swedish coast along the Baltic Sea; one of the largest brackish water bodies on Earth. We then estimated statistical relationships between the body size (length or height in mm), body dry mass and ash-free dry mass for 14 of the most common taxa; five gastropods, three bivalves, three crustaceans and three insect larvae. Finally, we statistically estimated the potential influence of body size on the AFDM/DM ratio per taxon. Results. For most taxa, non-linear regression models describing the power relationship between body size and (i)DMand (ii)AFDMfit the data well (as indicated by low SE and high R2). Moreover, for more than half of the taxa studied (including the vast majority of the shelled molluscs), body size had a negative influence on organism AFDM/DM ratios. Discussion. The good fit of the modelled power relationships suggests that the constants reported here can be used to quickly estimate organism dry- and ash-free dry mass based on body size, thereby freeing up considerable work resources. However, the considerable differences in constants between taxa emphasize the need for taxonspecific relationships, and the potential dangers associated with ignoring body size. The negative influence of body size on the AFDM/DM ratio found in a majority of the molluscs could be caused by increasingly thicker shells with organism age, and/or spawning-induced loss of biologically active tissue in adults. Consequently, future studies utilizing AFDM/DM (and presumably also AFDM/wet mass) ratios should carefully assess the potential influence of body size to ensure more reliable estimates of organism body mass. © 2017 Eklöf et al.","Biometry; Epifauna, Allometry; Estuary; Infauna; Isometric scaling; Length:weight relationship; Seagrass; Submerged aquatic vegetation; Weight","aquatic environment; Article; Baltic Sea; biomass; bivalve; body mass; body size; Crustacea; dry mass; gastropod; invertebrate; nonhuman; salinity"

Instead of a direct regression between the feature space and the shape space, the concept of shape increment reconstruction is introduced. Moreover, a set of coupled overcomplete dictionaries termed the shape increment dictionary and the local appearance dictionary are learned in a regressive manner to select robust features and fit shape increments. Additionally, to make the learned model more generalized, we select the best matched parameter set through extensive validation tests.

Methods: Women with singleton pregnancies were recruited at their second-trimester scan. Images of the umbilical cord were used to calculate the aUCI. Pregnancy and birth outcomes were recorded and statistical associations between aUCI and small for gestational age (SGA) using international standard birth weight centiles and preterm birth were investigated (n = 430). Results: aUCI results were consistent with the literature and showed good reproducibility between observers. Abnormal aUCI was not associated with SGA, but there was a statistical association with preterm birth (odds ratio 3.3 (95% confidence interval 1.4-7.7,P = 0.003). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for preterm birth were 47.6%, 76.9%, 9.6%, and 96.6%, respectively. Conclusions: The coiling index is unlikely to be useful in clinical practice as a screening tool for preterm birth owing to limited predictive value.

After the stressed period that spanned across western Tethys epicontinental seas during the early Toarcian, the following rebuilding of a restored water column ecosystem is coeval with the size increase of the Lotharingius genus coccoliths, one of the main pelagic producers at that time. In order to quantitatively assess the coccolith size evolution during a time span of ~ 10 myr, measurements of seven morphospecies of Lotharingius across the Toarcian and early Aalenian were performed. This study was carried out on a total of 5500 specimens from samples retrieved from two distinctive palaeoenvironmental settings in the western Mediterranean Tethys: three sections from the Lusitanian Basin in Portugal and one section from the Causses Basin in southern France. For each specimen, coccolith length, width and central area length and width were measured using specific measurement software. Statistical and data analysis tools were used in order to evaluate significant resemblances and/or differences between different size groups and samples. Two main clusters are acknowledged from this study. Small-sized Lotharingius is < 4 μm and large-sized Lotharingius is > 4 μm. In addition to common evolutionary processes, changes in palaeoenvironmental conditions were taken into account to explain such a size distribution. Although background evolution pushed the Lotharingius genus toward larger sizes, palaeoenvironmental conditions seemed to play an important role in the Toarcian-early Aalenian morphological evolution of this taxon. The production of larger coccoliths profited from stable environmental conditions, whereas smaller morphotypes dominated during periods marked by stress. The transition from small to large Lotharingius was synchronous in the two investigated western Tethys basins at the Bifrons-Gradata (or Variabilis) ammonite zone boundary (middle Toarcian), thus representing an important event for the Lower Jurassic calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biometry; Calcareous nannofossils; Lotharingius; Toarcian-Aalenian; Western Tethys","Ammonoidea; Haptophyceae; Lotharingius"

Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) and Hevin are structurally related matricellular proteins involved in extracellular matrix assembly. In this study, we compared the anterior chamber biometric parameters and iris collagen properties in SPARC-, Hevin- and SPARC-/Hevin-null with wild-type (WT) mice. METHODS. The right eyes of 53 WT, 35 SPARC-, 56 Hevin-, and 63 SPARC-/Hevin-null mice were imaged using the RTVue-100 Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography system. The parameters measured were anterior chamber depth (ACD), trabecular-iris space area (TISA), angle opening distance (AOD), and pupil diameter. Biometric data were analyzed using analysis of covariance and adjusted for age, sex, and pupil diameter. Expression of Col1a1, Col8a1, and Col8a2 transcripts in the irises was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Collagen fibril thickness was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS. Mice that were SPARC- and SPARC-/Hevin-null had 1.28- and 1.25-fold deeper ACD, 1.45- and 1.53-fold larger TISA, as well as 1.42- and 1.51-fold wider AOD than WT, respectively. These measurements were not significantly different between SPARC- and SPARC-/Hevin-null mice. The SPARC-null iris expressed lower Col1a1, but higher Col8a1 and Col8a2 transcripts compared with WT. Collagen fibrils in the SPARC- and SPARC-/Hevin-null irises were 1.5- and 1.7-fold thinner than WT, respectively. The Hevin-null iris did not differ from WT in these collagen properties. CONCLUSIONS. SPARC-null mice have deeper anterior chamber as well as wider drainage angles compared with WT. Therefore, SPARC plays a key role in influencing the spatial organization of the anterior segment, potentially via modulation of collagen properties, while Hevin is not likely to be involved. © 2017, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

Single or longitudinal measures of 3-dimensional fractional thigh volume may address this problem. Objective: We sought to derive normal values for 3-dimensional fractional thigh volume in the third trimester, determine if fractional thigh volume is superior to 2-dimensional ultrasound biometry alone for detecting fetal growth restriction, and determine whether individualized growth assessment parameters have the potential to identify fetal growth restriction remote from term delivery. Study Design: This was a longitudinal prospective cohort study of 115 unselected pregnancies in a tertiary referral unit (St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom). Standard 2-dimensional ultrasound biometry measurements were obtained, along with fractional thigh volume measurements (based on 50% of the femoral diaphysis length). Measurements were used to calculate estimated fetal weight (Hadlock). Individualized growth assessment parameters and percentage deviations in longitudinally measured biometrics were determined using a Web-based system (iGAP; http://iGAP.research.bcm.edu). Small for gestational age was defined <10th and fetal growth restriction <3rd customized birthweight centile. Logistic regression was used to compare estimated fetal weight (Hadlock), estimated fetal weight (biparietal diameter-abdominal circumference-fractional thigh volume), fractional thigh volume, and abdominal circumference for the prediction of small for gestational age or fetal growth restriction at birth. Screening performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: There was a better correlation between fractional thigh volume and estimated fetal weight ((biparietal diameter-abdominal circumference-fractional thigh volume) obtained at 34-36 weeks with birthweight than between 2-dimensional biometry measures such as abdominal circumference and estimated fetal weight (Hadlock). There was also a modest improvement in the detection of both small for gestational age and fetal growth restriction using fractional thigh volume-derived measures compared to standard 2-dimensional measurements (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.79-0.94, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.85-0.99, respectively). Conclusion: Fractional thigh volume measurements offer some improvement over 2-dimensional biometry for the detection of late-onset fetal growth restriction at 34-36 weeks. © 2017 The Authors.","3-dimensional ultrasound; Estimated fetal weight; Fetal growth restriction; Fractional thigh volume; Small for gestational age",

Methods: In 2835 singleton pregnancies maternal characteristics and medical history were recorded and maternal cardiovascular parameters were measured. The observed measurements of cardiovascular parameters were expressed as multiples of the normal median (MoM) values after adjustment for those characteristics found to provide a substantial contribution to their measurement. Regression analysis was used to determine the significance of association between the normalized values of the cardiovascular parameters with birth-weight Z-score. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was then used to determine if the maternal factors, fetal biometry and maternal cardiovascular parameters had a significant contribution to predicting SGA and LGA neonates. The performance of screening was determined by the area under receiver–operating characteristics curves (AUC). Results: In the study population there were significant positive associations between maternal cardiac output and heart rate with neonatal birth-weight Z-score, and significant negative associations between total peripheral resistance and mean arterial pressure (MAP) with neonatal birth-weight Z-score. In pregnancies delivering SGA neonates (n = 249 (8.8%)), cardiac output and heart rate were lower and total peripheral resistance and MAP were higher, whereas in pregnancies delivering LGA neonates (n = 292 (10.3%)) cardiac output and heart rate were higher and total peripheral resistance and MAP were lower. The performance of screening for delivery of SGA neonates achieved by maternal characteristics and fetal biometry was not improved by the measurement of maternal cardiovascular parameters. There was a small but significant improvement in the performance of screening for delivery of LGA neonates by maternal factors and fetal biometry with the addition of maternal heart rate (comparison of AUC, P = 0.0095). Conclusions: There are significant associations between maternal cardiac output, heart rate, total peripheral resistance and MAP and neonatal birth-weight Z-score; such findings reflect the close relationship between maternal cardiac function and fetal demands. However, assessment of these parameters at 35–37 weeks' gestation is unlikely to improve substantially the performance of screening for SGA or LGA neonates provided by a combination of maternal factors and fetal biometry.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the biometric testicular traits, calculate the volume testicular and analyze the serum testosterone concentration of the stallion. During six months were measured the tests of adults Brazilian Ponies stallions from northern of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The length, the width and the height of the testicles (TL, TW and TH) were measured. From these measurements, the total testicular volume (TTV) was calculated. The serum testosterone concentration was also evaluated. The data were studied by analysis of variance and were calculated the correlations among the traits. The average of the testis biometry were TL 5.8 ± 0.6 cm; TW 3.8 ± 0.5 cm; TH 4.7 ± 0.4 cm and 111.2 ± 27.7 for TTV. Mean of serum testosterone concentration was 0.89 ± 0.52 ng/dl. High correlations between biometry testicular traits with testicular volume were observed and low to moderate correlations were observed for testicular traits, testosterone and sperm output. The testis size could be an important trait that assists to the prediction of stallion's reproductive potential of the Brazilian ponies stallions. It is suggested that there would be no fluctuation in serum testosterone concentration in Brazilian ponies stallions that coult afect on its fertility.","Andrology; Horse; Reproduction",

Each application utilizing WSN for accomplishing its goals sets trust and reliability requirements that a WSN must provide according to its limited resources. A new paradigm for designing trusted and reliable WSNs is to utilize reusable communication protocols to construct generic flexible communication infrastructure. In this paper, we highlight the main QoS requirements and network supports that are determined by several WSN applications. These QoS requirements vary according to the application type and specifications. For this purpose, we consider an innovative and effective generic WSN infrastructure to insure QoS requirements according to the application parameters, and maintaining trust and reliability.

Design: Population-based cross-sectional study. Participants: A total of 1133 preschoolers 3 to 6 years of age from 8 representative kindergartens. Methods: Biometric measurements including axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and corneal radius of curvature (CR) were obtained from partial-coherence laser interferometry (IOL Master; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Oberkochen, Germany) before cycloplegia. Lens power (LP) and AL-to-CR ratio were calculated. Cycloplegic refraction (3 drops of 1% cyclopentolate) was measured using an autorefractor (KR8800; Topcon Corp., Tokyo, Japan), and spherical equivalent refraction (SER) was calculated. Biometric and refractive parameters were assessed as a function of age and gender. Multiple regression analysis was performed to explore the associations between refraction and ocular biometry. Main Outcome Measures: Ocular biometric distributions and their relationships to refraction. Results: Among the 1127 children (99.5%) with successful cycloplegic refraction, mean SER was 1.37±0.63 diopters (D). Prevalence of myopia increased from 0% at 3 years of age to 3.7% (95% confidence interval, 1.0%-6.5%) at 6 years of age. Biometric parameters followed Gaussian distributions with means of 22.39±0.68 mm for AL, 7.79±0.25 mm for CR, and 24.61±1.42 D for calculated LP; and non-Gaussian distributions with means of 3.34±0.24 mm for ACD and 2.88±0.06 for AL-to-CR ratio. Axial length, ACD, and AL-to-CR ratio increased from 3 to 6 years of age, CR remained stable, whereas LP declined. Overall, SER declined slightly. For the SER variance, AL explained 18.6% and AL-to-CR ratio explained 39.8%, whereas AL, CR, and LP accounted for 80.0% after adjusting for age and gender. Conclusions: Young Chinese children are predominantly mildly hyperopic, with a low prevalence of myopia by the age of 6 years. An increase of 1 mm in AL was associated with only 0.45 D of myopic change. Decreases in LP reduce the myopic shifts that normally would be associated with increases in AL, and thus play a key role in refractive development in this age group. © 2017 American Academy of Ophthalmology.",,

These traits revealed that Kajali sheep were large in size and suitable for mutton production. The positive and highly significant phenotypic correlations among most of the traits indicates high predictability among these traits. PCA extracted major three components which explained 68.66% of total variation of body biometry. First component described the body size and explained about 36% of total variation. It was represented by high component loadings for chest girth, paunch girth and body weight. The second component described the tail length, height and ear length and explained about 21% variation. The communalities ranges between 0.33 (face length) to 0.87 (chest girth). The lower communality of face length and ear length indicates that these traits are less effective to explain the body conformation. The study suggested that PCA could be used in breeding programme for phenotypic selection of Kajali ewes and PCA is more appropriate compared to multiple regression analysis in predicting adult body weight. In predicting body weight using multiple regression analysis, chest girth alone accounted for 55% of total variation in body weight whereas, use of first principal component as a single predictor explained 79% of total variance and the best prediction equation (R2 = 0.83) was obtained after inclusion of second and third component in the model.","Kajali sheep; Morphometry; Multivariate analysis; PCA",

The optimization of a projection index should provide a set of multiple optima that is expected to correspond to interesting graphical representations in low dimensional space. The implementation of the bio-inspired algorithms along with the projection pursuit develops a new software called EPP-Lab. Projection pursuit is widely used in different scientific domains (biology, pharmacy, bioinformatics, biometry, etc) but not widely present in the well-known softwares. EPP-Lab is dedicated to recognize and visualize clusters and outlying observations on one dimension from high dimensional and multivariate data sets. It includes different statistical techniques for results analysis. It provides several features and gives the user the option to adjust the parameters of the selected bio-inspired methods or to use defaults values. EPP-Lab is a unique software for detection, visualization and analysis of non-linear structures. The performance of this tool has been validated by testing different real and simulated data sets. © 2016 The Author","Clustering; Exploratory Projection Pursuit; Genetic Algorithm; Outliers; Particle Swarm Optimization; Tribes",

Compare the result of visual acuity in aphakic microphthalmus eyes, with the visual acuity result obtained in non microphthalmus eyes. Methods: Retrospective study of 76 patients with microphthalmia and congenital cataract, selected after analysis of 1050 medical records of patients seen in congenital cataract clinic of UNIFESP. All patients underwent complete ophthalmologic examination and microphthalmia determined by ultrasound biometry. Investigations were made to clarify the etiological cause. The postoperative visual outcome of Group I (with microphthalmia) was faced with the visual results obtained in Group II (control group without microphthalmia). Results: The anteroposterior diameter of microphthalmus eyes ranged from 13 to 21 mm. The etiological frequency of microphthalmia and congenital cataract was distributed as follows: infectious diseases (55.3%), idiopathic (26.3%), colobomas (7.9%), hereditary (6.6%), persistent hyperplastic vitreous (2.6%) and linked to the Lenz's syndrome (1.3%). The visual acuity in aphakic eyes that reached better view and or equal to 20/200 was 68.3%. Conclusion: The frequency of microphthalmia associated with congenital cataract was 7.23%. The etiological occurred more frequently in infectious disease (55.3%). The aphakics eyes with microphthalmia tend to have worse visual acuity results than the eyes without microphthalmia. If we consider the visual results same and above 20/200 as successful in this search, aphakic eyes with microphthalmia that hit these indices are 68.3%.","Aphakics; Cataract/congenital; Congenital abnormalities; Microphthalmus; Postcataract",

Four hundred and eighty (480) one day old male broiler Cobb chicks were used. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial 2 x 4, with and without supplemental taurine and glycine and 4 diets (control, fish, soy and sunflower oil), totaling six treatments with six repetitions of 10 birds each. The experimental diets were supplied from 0 to 4 days old. The performance was evaluated in housing and 4, 7 and 21 days of age. On these same dates, 2 birds per experimental unit were sacrificed for gut biometrics and histomorphometry of intestinal mucosa. The addition of different sources of fat, glycine and taurine supplementation on transition diets did not influence productive performance from 1 to 21 days. Supplementation of diets with glycine and taurine altered the morphology of the intestinal mucosa, mainly of the duodenum, resulting in greater length of villi and villi: crypt ratio.

From these data, topographic maps can be derived to assist the ophthalmologist in the diagnosis of disorders. In this paper, we compare three different mathematical parametric representations of the corneal surfaces leastsquares fitted to the data provided by corneal topography. The parameters obtained from these models reduce the dimensionality of the data from several thousand 3D points to only a few parameters and could eventually be useful for diagnosis, biometry, implant design etc. The first representation is based on Zernike polynomials that are commonly used in optics. A variant of these polynomials, named Bhatia-Wolf will also be investigated. These two sets of polynomials are defined over a circular domain which is convenient to model the elevation (height) of the corneal surface. The third representation uses Spherical Harmonics that are particularly well suited for nearly-spherical object modeling, which is the case for cornea. We compared the three methods using the following three criteria: the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the number of parameters and the visual accuracy of the reconstructed topographic maps. A large dataset of more than 2000 corneal topographies was used. Our results showed that Spherical Harmonics were superior with a RMSE mean lower than 2.5 microns with 36 coefficients (order 5) for normal corneas and lower than 5 microns for two diseases affecting the corneal shapes: keratoconus and Fuchs' dystrophy. © 2017 SPIE.","3D shape; Bhatia-Wolf polynomials; Corneal topography; Parametric model; Spherical harmonics; Zernike polynomials","Diagnosis; Harmonic analysis; Imaging techniques; Maps; Mean square error; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Optical data processing; Polynomials; Spheres; Topography; 3-D shape; Corneal topography; Parametric modeling; Spherical harmonics; Zernike polynomials; Image processing"

Patients: A total of 157 white pregnant women (median age, 32 years; range, 14 to 47 years) undergoing routine ultrasound exams. Main Outcome Measure(s): Description of the fetal tooth germs, as visualized by twodimensional ultrasonography, including results from prior fetal biometry and detailed screening for malformations. Results: In the first trimester group, ultrasonography identified 10 tooth germs in the maxilla and 10 tooth germs in the mandible in all fetuses except for one who presented eight maxillary tooth germs. This case was associated with a chromosomal abnormality (trisomy 13) with a bilateral cleft palate. In the second and third trimesters group, ultrasonography identified a larger range of tooth germs: 81.2% of fetuses showed 10 tooth germs in the maxilla and 85.0% of fetuses had 10 tooth germs in the mandible. Hypodontia was more prevalent in the maxilla than in the mandible, which led us to use qualitative two-dimensional ultrasonography to analyze the possible association between hypodontia and other variables such as fetal pathology, markers, head, nuchal, face, and spine. Conclusions: We recommend using this method as the first exam to evaluate fetal morphology and also to help establish accurate diagnosis of abnormalities in pregnancy. © 2017 American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association.","Diagnosis; Prenatal; Tooth buds; Tooth germ; Ultrasound",

In other pregnant animals, glucocorticoids are given to stimulate fetal maturation with long-term metabolic consequences for the offspring if given preterm. However, their metabolic effects during equine pregnancy remain unknown. Objective: Thus, this study investigated the metabolic effects of dexamethasone administration on pregnant pony mares and their foals after birth. Study design: Experimental study. Methods: A total of 3 doses of dexamethasone (200 μg/kg bwt i.m.) were given to 6 pony mares at 48 h intervals beginning at ≈270 days of pregnancy. Control saline injections were given to 5 mares using the same protocol. After fasting overnight, pancreatic β cell responses to exogenous glucose were measured in the mares before, during and after treatment. After birth, pancreatic β cell responses to exogenous glucose and arginine were measured in the foals at 2 and 12 weeks. Results: In mares during treatment, dexamethasone but not saline increased basal insulin concentrations and prolonged the insulin response to exogenous glucose. Basal insulin and glucose concentrations still differed significantly between the 2 groups 72 h post treatment. Dexamethasone treatment significantly reduced placental area but had little effect on foal biometry at birth or subsequently. Foal β cell function at 2 weeks was unaffected by maternal treatment. However, by 12 weeks, pancreatic β cell sensitivity to arginine, but not glucose, was less in foals delivered by dexamethasone- than saline-treated mares. Conclusions: Dexamethasone administration induced changes in maternal insulin-glucose dynamics, indicative of insulin resistance and had subtle longer term effects on post natal β cell function of the foals. The programming effects of dexamethasone in horses may be mediated partially by altered maternal metabolism and placental growth. © 2016 EVJ Ltd","dexamethasone; glucocorticoids; glucose tolerance; horse; insulin","dexamethasone; dexamethasone 21-phosphate; insulin; analogs and derivatives; animal; chemically induced; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug effects; female; horse; hyperinsulinism; metabolism; newborn; pancreas islet beta cell; physiology; pregnancy; veterinary; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Dexamethasone; Female; Horses; Hyperinsulinism; Insulin; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Pregnancy"

Maternal cardiovascular changes contribute to uteroplacental perfusion; however, they have not yet been investigated in relation to fetal growth or BW. Our aim was to explore the relationship between maternal cardiovascular adaptation, fetal growth and BW in healthy pregnancies. Methods: This was a longitudinal prospective study of women planning to conceive a pregnancy. Maternal cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), pulse-wave velocity, aortic augmentation index, central blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance were assessed prior to pregnancy and at 6, 23 and 33 weeks' gestation. Fetal growth was assessed using serial ultrasound measurements of biometry. Results: In total, 143 women volunteered to participate and were eligible for study inclusion. A total of 101 women conceived within 18 months and there were 64 live births with normal pregnancy outcome. There were positive correlations between BW and the pregnancy-induced changes in CO (ρ = 0.4, P = 0.004), CI (ρ = 0.3, P = 0.02) and peripheral vascular resistance (ρ = 0.3, P = 0.02). There were significant associations between second-to-third-trimester fetal weight gain and the prepregnancy-to-second-trimester increase in CO (Δ, 0.8 ± 1.2 L/min; ρ = 0.3, P = 0.02) and CI (Δ, 0.4 ± 0.6 L/min/m2; ρ = 0.3, P = 0.04) and reduction in aortic augmentation index (Δ, −10 ± 9%; ρ = −0.3, P = 0.04). Conclusions: In healthy pregnancy, incremental changes in maternal CO in early pregnancy are associated with third-trimester fetal growth and BW. It is plausible that this association is causative as the changes predate third-trimester fetal growth and eventual BW. Copyright © 2016 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

The objective of this study was to estimate the coefficient of repeatability of biometric and yield traits, related to fruits and seeds of sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis), and to define the number of evaluations required for an efficient selection and evaluation of genotypes of the species. A total of 37 non-domesticated accessions were evaluated for 19 months in a randomized block design with 5 replications and 2 plants per plot. The total number of fruits, total number of seeds, total fruit weight, mean fruit weight, and number of seeds per fruit of the accessions were evaluated by monthly sampling. Additionally, seed biometry was assessed in a sample of 30 seeds per accession. Repeatability coefficients were estimated by analysis of variance, principal components and structural analysis. The principal component method based on the covariance matrix was the most appropriate for establishing repeatability estimates of sacha inchi, due to the cyclical nature of the crop. Superior genotypes of the species can be selected for yield-related traits with about 90% accuracy, from 5 harvests (months) onwards. To ensure this accuracy level, it would be necessary to evaluate a minimum of 5 and 25 fruits to determine mean fruit weight and number of seeds per fruit, respectively, and 39 seeds would be required to evaluate the biometric traits. © 2017 Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia.

However, pregnancy and related issues remain a challenge in these patients. In routine clinical practice, health professionals dealing with SLE and APS need to consider the numerous aspects of the reproductive life of their patients, such as pregnancy, family planning, fertility, contraception, cancer surveillance, and menopause. The new European League Against Rheumatism recommendations for women's health and family planning reflect the need for a novel approach to communication in the patient-physician relationship. Preconception counseling is essential to ensure optimal pregnancy outcomes through a careful risk stratification involving disease activity, organ involvement, autoantibody profile, use of drugs, and previous pregnancy outcomes, as well as to ensure better preventive and therapeutic strategies to limit complications. In patients with stable/inactive disease and low risk of thrombosis, adequate hormonal contraception and menopausal replacement therapy should be recommended. Assisted reproductive techniques can be safely used in these patients, but anticoagulation or low-dose aspirin (or both) should be added in those with positive antiphospholipid antibody titers. All menstruating women should be counseled on the possibility to preserve fertility with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues if receiving alkylating agents. Strict clinical, serological, laboratory, and multidisciplinary monitoring during pregnancy is mandatory to early recognize and effectively treat disease flares or obstetric complications. Doppler ultrasonography and fetal biometry should be regularly performed, especially in the second and third trimesters. Physicians should recommend screening for cervical dysplasia related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, especially during immunosuppressive therapy, and HPV immunization can be used in women with stable/inactive disease.","Family planning; Fertility; Menopause; Pregnancy; Systemic lupus erythematosus",

Methods: Study uses secondary data from the PRECONCEPT randomized controlled trial in Thai Nguyen province, Vietnam (n = 1436). Prospective data were collected on women starting pre-pregnancy through delivery. Maternal conditional weight gain (CWG) was defined as window-specific weight gains, uncorrelated with pre-pregnancy body mass index and all prior body weights. Fetal biometry, was assessed by ultrasound measurements of head and abdomen circumferences, biparietal diameter, and femoral length throughout pregnancy. Birth size outcomes included weight and length, and head, abdomen and mid upper arm circumferences as well as small for gestational age (SGA). Adjusted generalized linear and logistic models were used to examine associations. Results: Overall, three-quarters of women gained below the Institute of Medicine guidelines, and these women were 2.5 times more likely to give birth to a SGA infant. Maternal CWG in the first window (≤ 20 weeks), followed by 21-29 weeks, had the greatest association on all parameters of fetal growth (except abdomen circumference) and infant size at birth. For birth weight, a 1 SD increase CWG in the first 20 weeks had 3 times the influence compared to later CWG (≥ 30 weeks) (111 g vs. 39 g) and was associated with a 43% reduction in SGA risk (OR (95% CI): 0.57 (0.46-0.70).

The history of American psychiatry is instructive in this respect. From an early date, the United States embraced psychoanalysis, invented behaviorism, promoted biological psychiatry, used biometry and produced a highly successful classification of mental disorders. The objective of this paper is the study of this history. Method The paper proposes a detailed study of the theories, practices and ideological debates in the field of American psychiatry since the 18th century, and of federal mental health policies. Results Psychiatry in the United States has distinctive features linked to the concept of manifest destiny, Protestantism and pragmatism, to the manner in which the nation was constructed (slavery, conquest of the West, economic liberalism) and to the ceaseless wars, from the War of Independence to the Middle Eastern wars, not forgetting the Civil War and two World Wars. As the nation succeeded in integrating its immigrants, it also assimilated their different cultures and their discoveries in the field psychiatry. Many theories and practices that later diffused by globalization were instigated by the nation, among others the DSMs, part of the cultural, scientific, economic and political development of the nation. Lay people were early protagonists in the constructive shifts, conflicts and anti-psychiatry tendencies. Discussion This paper examines the growing success of psychoanalysis in the 1950s and the causes behind its loss of influence in the 1970s. It does not attribute this loss to the DSM-III, but to the psychoanalysts themselves. It sets out to demonstrate that the DSM-III and later DSMs did not result in a paradigm shift in the meaning of Thomas Kuhn. Conclusion The history of American psychiatry proves that there is little chance of seeing an end to the conflicts between advocates of the brain, still poorly understood, and upholders of the mind, often poorly defined, as long as our knowledge in the field of mental disorders remains as slim as it is today. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS","Behaviorism; Brain; Classification; DSMs; History; Mind; Psychoanalysis; Psychology; Science; United States",

Methods: A total of 50 eyes from 50 adult subjects had biometry measurements in one session three times using the Pentacam AXL and the IOLMaster 700. Keratometry, anterior chamber depth (ACD) and axial length (AL) values were obtained by both devices. Mean keratometry (K mean) was calculated and the corneal spherocylinder was converted into power vectors (J0, J45). Repeatability was assessed based on intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Agreement was evaluated by linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman analysis by calculating the mean difference and 95% limits of agreement (LoA). Results: Assessment of intraoperator repeatability by means of ICC showed excellent reproducibility of measurements for both devices and all parameters examined ranging from 0.994 to 1.0. IOLMaster 700 exhibited significantly higher K mean (p &lt;0.001) and AL (p &lt;0.001) values than the Pentacam AXL.

Methods: A retrospective case series review of 103 consecutive eyes that underwent phaco-ECP and 62 eyes that underwent phacoemulsification between January 2006 and August 2012 was conducted. Post-operative refractive outcomes were obtained by subjective refraction or autorefraction. Demographic data, best corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, number of glaucoma agents and mean deviation of the Humphrey visual field test (MD) were also analysed. Results: The total number of eyes included in the study was 62 eyes for the phaco-ECP group and 62 eyes for the control group who underwent phacoemulsification alone. More than 90% of eyes (n = 56) in phaco-ECP group achieved post-operative refraction within ±1 dioptre (D) of the target refraction. In the control group, 100% of eyes achieved post-operative refraction within ±1D of the target refraction. When comparing the difference between the target and the actual refractive outcome between the phaco-ECP and the control group, there was no statistically significant difference. Conclusions: Refractive outcome after phaco-ECP is comparable to phacoemulsification alone. This study suggests that the intraocular lens power can be selected for cataract surgery alone and that ECP does not change the effective lens position significantly; therefore, no modification of biometry formulae is required. Phaco-ECP should be considered as an effective, safe and predictable surgical treatment option for glaucoma patients with co-existing cataract. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Cataract; Endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation; Glaucoma; Phaco-ECP; Phacoemulsification; Refractive outcome",

Methods: This retrospective analysis was carried out in 45 selected pregnancies at risk for fetal growth restriction. Serial fetal biometry was carried out in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. First and second trimester placental biomarkers, 2nd trimester uterine artery (Ut A) velocimetry and postnatal placental pathology were evaluated as indicators of placental insufficiency. At delivery, weight (WT), head circumference (HC) and crown–heel length (CHL) were measured. BWs were categorized as large-for-gestational-age (LGA), appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) and small-for-gestational age (SGA) (<10th, 10th–90th and >90th percentiles). In these categories, neonatal growth outcomes were classified as growth restricted (GR), normal (NORMAL) or macrosomic (MACRO) based on BW plus Plac Assess (Ut A velocimetry, biomarkers, pathology) or IGA [growth potential realization index profile (WT, HC and CHL)]. Results: There were 6 LGA, 14 AGA and 25 SGA neonates in this sample. All 14 AGA neonates were considered NORMAL by both IGA and BW + Plac Assess. All six LGA neonates were classified as MACRO by BW + Plac Assess but only four by IGA (the remaining two were NORMAL and high NORMAL). The 25 SGA cases could be divided into five subgroups based on IGA and BW + Plac Assess. The largest subgroup (56%) was GR and the next largest (24%) was NORMAL by both classification methods. In the remaining 20%, there was some evidence of GR but IGA and BW + Plac Assess were not in complete agreement. Conclusions: Agreement was good for all three methods in the LGA and AGA groups. The SGA group was heterogeneous but agreement between IGA and BW + Plac Assess was 89%. These results, using more sophisticated growth assessment methods, confirm placental insufficiency as a primary cause of growth restriction.

Towards this aim, juvenile whitefish individuals received an intraperitoneal injection with pure MC-LR, and the injection was repeated every week to maintain continuous exposure for 28 days. During the exposure period, growth and condition of the fish were assessed based on biometric measurements. Additionally, selected biochemical markers were analysed in the fishes’ blood, and their livers were carefully examined for morphological, ultrastructural, and molecular changes. The higher dose of MC-LR (100 μg·kg− 1) caused severe liver injury at the beginning of the exposure period, whereas the lower dose (10 μg·kg− 1) caused less, probably reversible injury, and its effects began to be observed later in the exposure period. These marked changes were accompanied by substantial MC-LR uptake by the liver. However, starting on the 7th day of exposure, cell debris began to be removed by phagocytes, then by 14th day, proliferation of liver cells had markedly increased, which led to reconstruction of the liver parenchyma at the end of the treatment. Surprisingly, despite weekly-repeated intraperitoneal injections, MC-LR did not accumulate over time of exposure which suggests its limited uptake in the later phase of exposure. In support, mRNA expression of the membrane transport protein oatp1d was decreased at the same time as the regenerative processes were observed. Our study shows that closing of active membrane transport may serve as one defence mechanism against further MC-LR intoxication. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Apoptosis; Cyanobacteria; Fishes; Histopathology; Regeneration; Tissue distribution","alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; biochemical marker; carrier protein; glucose; messenger RNA; microcystin LR; oatp1d protein; protein; unclassified drug; chromatin; microcystin; microcystin LR; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bilirubin blood level; biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism; biometry; cell nucleus membrane; cell vacuole; controlled study; endoplasmic reticulum; fish; glucose blood level; histopathology; juvenile animal; liver cell; liver injury; liver parenchyma; liver regeneration; long term exposure; membrane transport; nonhuman; phagocyte; protein blood level; protein expression; white fish; animal; chromatin; cytoskeleton; drug effects; liver; liver regeneration; salmonid; Animals; Chromatin; Cytoskeleton; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Liver; Liver Regeneration; Microcystins; Salmonidae"

Objective: This study was to analyze the difference of lens thickness (LT) measured by immersion A-scan ultrasound versus optical biometry and consistency of these two methods in measuring the LT for different types of cataract eyes, and to investigate whether A-scan ultrasound for the LT measurement needs to correct the ultrasound speed parameter. Methods: A reliability evaluation of diagnosis test was designed. The LT was measured on 143 cataract eyes using immersion A-scan ultrasound and Lenstar optical biometry in Tianjin Eye Hospital from September 2013 to May 2014. The eyes were assigned to nuclear cataract group (60 eyes of 50 patients), posterior subcapsular cataract group (40 eyes of 40 patients) and cortical cataract group (43 eyes of 43 patients) based on the types of cataract, and the hardness of nucleus was grade II in 20 eyes of 14 patients, grade IE in 20 eyes of 17 patients and grade IV in 20 eyes of 19 patients. The outcomes measured by immersion A-scan ultrasound versus Lenstar optical biometry were compared with paired t test, and the consistency between the two devices was analyzed by Bland-Altman agreement plot. This study complied with Helsinki declaration, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to any examination. Results: The mean LT value was (4.85 ± 0.39) mm from the immersion A-scan ultrasound and (4.74 ± 0.37) mm from the Lenstar optical biometry, with a significant difference between the two devices (t=3.020, P=0.004). No significant differences were found in the LT values of the posterior subcapsular cataractous eyes and cortical cataractous eyes between the two devices (t=1.015, P=0.316; t=1.275, P=0.209). The LT values by immersion A-scan ultrasound were significantly higher in grade II, III and IV nuclear cataractous eyes than those by Lenstar optical biometry (t=2.175, 2.378, 2.383, all at P<0.05). The outcome showed a good consistency in the posterior subcapsular cataractous eyes between the two measuring methods, with the 95% limitation of agreement (LoA) from -0.21 to 0.18 mm. However, there were poor consistencies between the two measuring methods in the nuclear and cortical cataractous eyes, with the 95% LoA from -0.64 to 0.43 mm and from -0.50 to 0.41 mm, respectively. Poor consistencies also were seen in grade II, III, IV nuclear cataractous eyes between the two measuring methods, and the 95% LoA were -0.31 to 0.22 mm, -0.32 to 0.24 mm and -1.09 to 0.62 mm, respectively. Conclusions: There are differences in measuring LT of different types of cataractous eyes between immersion A-scan ultrasound and Lenstar optical biometry. The measuring values are higher by immersion A-scan ultrasound than those by Lenstar optical biometry, suggesting that the measurement of immersion A-scan ultrasound for LT of different types and nuclear hardness of cataractous eyes should correct the ultrasound speed parameters.

Ophtha TOP is a new IOL calculator, so it is necessary to evaluate the repeatability and accuracy of Ophtha TOP in measuring corneal refractive parameters. Objective: This study was to evaluate the repeatability of Ophtha TOP in measuring corneal refractive status in normal eyes and determine the agreement of the measuring outcomes between Ophtha TOP and Pentacam in pre-surgery cataract eyes. Methods: A reliability evaluation method of diagnosis test was performed from September 2013 to October 2014. Sixty eyes of healthy volunteers aged (30.83 ± 8.66) years old were examined in Tianjin Eye Hospital with Ophtha TOP for more than 5 times to evaluate the stability in measuring corneal refractive parameters. Corneal refractive parameters were measured by both Ophtha TOP and Pentacam for more than twice in 30 pre-surgery cataract eyes to assess the agreement with Pentacam. Keratometry and astigmatism parameters were recorded, including the flattest meridian (Kf), steepest meridian (Ks), mean keratometry (Km) and the astigmatism at JO and J45. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), repeatability (2.77Sw) and coefficient of variation (CoVs) were used to assess the stability of Ophtha TOP, and Bland-Altman graphs were adopted to value the consistency of measuring outcomes between Ophtha TOP and Pentacam. This study complied with Helsinki declaration, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to any medical examination. Results: The ICC of Ks, Kf, Km, J0 and J45 by Ophtha TOP were all ≥0.90, and 2.77Sw were all ≤0.36, The CoVs of Kf, Ks, Km by Ophtha TOP were all ≤0.30. The measuring values of Kf, Ks and Km were significantly higher in the Ophtha TOP than those in the Pentacam, with the mean differences (0.18 ± 0.28) D, (0.24 ± 0.29) D and (0.21 ± 0.26)D, respectively(i=3.48, 4.50, 4.49, all at P=0.00). The mean difference of the JO was (0.07 ± 0.21) D and that of the J45 was (-0.02 ± 0.18)D between Ophtha TOP and Pentacam, showing insignificant differences between them (both at P>0.05). Bland-Altman graphs revealed that the 95% limit of agreement (LoA) of Kf, Ks and Km between the two methods was -0.37 D to 0.73 D, -0.33 D to 0.81 D and -0.30 D to 0.72 D, respectively, and that of JO and J45 was -0.34 D to 0.48 D and -0.37 D to 0.33 D, respectively. Conclusions: Ophtha TOP shows an excellent repeatability. Compared with Pentacam, Ophtha TOP presents a good consistence for measurement of the corneal astigmatism and moderate consistence for corneal curvature.

As this pearl aquaculture is carried out at numerous grow-out sites, this study analyzes the environmental influence on pearl size parameters (nacre weight and thickness) in relation to the recipient oyster biometric parameters (shell thickness, height, width, and oyster weight) at harvest time. Toward this end, an experimental graft was designed by using a homogeneous donor oyster phenotype. The recipient oysters were randomly and equally transferred and reared in five commercial and contrasting grow-out locations. Overall inter-site comparisons revealed that the cultured pearl size (N = 2168) and the biometric parameters of the recipient oysters were highest for sites with warmer temperatures with low seasonal variation in comparison to the southern latitude sites. These results were supported by positive correlations between pearl nacre thickness and recipient oyster shell thickness, height, and width. In parallel, the biomineralization potential of the mantle graft was screened through four genes encoding aragonite (Pif 177, MSI60) and calcite (shematrin 9, aspein). As the gene expression levels were the same among all the donor oysters, this finding demonstrates that: 1) the pearl sac that originated from the mantle graft was not isolated from environmental variations during the culture period and 2) the phenotypic expressions of the two biomineralizing tissues in the recipient oyster were consistent (shell and pearl). In the near future, this knowledge will be helpful at the production sites of genetically selected donor oyster lines for growth produced in hatchery systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cultured pearl size; Donor oysters; Environmental influences; Gene expression; Pinctada margaritifera; Recipient oysters","aragonite; biometry; biomineralization; bivalve; calcite; environmental factor; gene expression; growth; growth rate; phenotype; seasonal variation; shellfish culture; Ostreidae; Pinctada margaritifera"

Methods: We performed a prospective cross-sectional study with 53 pregnant women between 24 and 36 weeks of gestation. An ultrasound exam was performed for each participant to obtain the CL measurement (transvaginal route) and fetal adrenal gland biometry on day 1 of their hospital admission because of symptoms of spontaneous PB. The main outcome measure was the time between the ultrasound exam and delivery, which was classified into two groups: delivery ≤7 days and delivery >7 days. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was performed to define the cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity. Results: The prevalence of delivery within 7 days was 35.8%, which showed a statistically significant difference from the depth of the central zone of the fetal adrenal gland (p = 0.036). The cutoff for the depth of the central zone of the fetal adrenal gland was 7.2 mm (sensitivity 66.7%, specificity 61.8% and accuracy 63.5%). These values were not significantly different than the cutoffs for cervical length measurement: 20 mm (p = 0.267) and 9 mm (p = 0.118).

The course topics ideally should be selected for their relevance but also for the target audience and their previous knowledge. The overall objective is to improve the long-term availability of what has been learned. For this reason, an evaluation among lecturers of German-speaking veterinary schools was carried out in 2012 to consider which topics in biometry and epidemiology they found relevant to other subject areas. Based on this survey, two veterinary schools (Berlin and Hannover) developed a structured approach for the introductory course in biometry and epidemiology. By means of an appropriate choice of topics and the use of adequate teaching methods, the quality of the lecture course could be significantly increased. Appropriately communicated learning objectives as well as a high rate of student activity resulted in increased student satisfaction. A certain degree of standardization of teaching approaches and material resulted in a comparison between the study sites and reduced variability in the content delivered at different schools. Part of this was confirmed by the high consistency in the multiple-choice examination results between the study sites. The results highlight the extent to which didactic and methodical restructuring of teaching affects the learning success and satisfaction of students.

Acute viral and bacterial inflammatory diseases are the most common causes of submandibular gland enlargement. Reduction in their size is observed in chronic inflammation and after radiation therapy. Various benign and malignant neoplasms also affect them. Therefore it is important to know the normal range of measurements as a reference. High frequency ultrasound is an easily available and reliable radiological investigation used for primary evaluation of the submandibular glands. The study was conducted to determine biometry of submandibular gland in healthy adults by high frequency ultrasound. Methods Total 100 subjects from third to seventh decade underwent high frequency ultrasound of submandibular gland. There were equal numbers of both genders in each decade. Length, depth, width and volume of both glands were recorded. Result The mean antero-posterior length was 3.26 ± 0.34 cm, paramandibular depth was 1.74 ± 0.27 cm and lateral-medial width (transverse) was 2.23 ± 0.37 cm. Volume measurement by ultrasound was 7.06 ± 2.51 ml. Discussion Measurement of size and volume of submandibular gland is now easily possible with the help of high frequency ultrasound. These can be used as reference value in determining increase or reduction in size of the gland in various disorders. © 2017 Anatomical Society of India","Biometry; High frequency ultrasound; Salivary gland; Submandibular gland",

Methods A retrospective observational study of eyes undergoing cataract surgery. Data were retrieved on AL, ACD, and K measurements obtained by the Aladdin and the IOLMaster. Furthermore, the postoperative refractive prediction errors were compared between the devices. Results The study included 127 consecutive eyes of 127 patients undergoing cataract surgery. Mean measurements of AL were not significantly different between the Aladdin (24.18 ± 1.89 mm) and IOLMaster (24.18 ± 1.89 mm) (p = 0.792). Mean K measurements were different between Aladdin (43.84 ± 1.56 D) and IOLMaster (43.97 ± 1.61 D) (p < 0.001). For AL, Aladdin measurements correlated strongly with IOLMaster measurements (r = 0.9997). For K, Aladdin measurements correlated strongly with IOLMaster measurements (r = 0.9912). Fifty-eight of the 127 eyes underwent cataract surgery with a monofocal intraocular lens. For these, mean absolute error (MAE) in predicting refraction relative to the measured postoperative refraction differed between Aladdin (MAE = 0.54 ± 0.40D) and IOLMaster (MAE = 0.49 ± 0.41D) (p = 0.001). After adjustment for the systematic difference in K measurements, the difference in MAE was no longer significant (p = 0.601). The ACD measurements did not differ significantly (p = 0.873) and were well correlated (r = 0.8327). Conclusions A very good correlation was found in AL, K, and ACD measurements between the Aladdin biometer and the IOLMaster. Minimal adjustment for the constant difference in keratometry measurements matched the refractive predictability of both devices. © 2016 American Academy of Optometry.","Aladdin; biometry; cataract; comparison; IOLMaster; surgery","Aluminum; Intraocular lenses; Refraction; Surgery; Aladdin; biometry; cataract; comparison; IOLMaster; Optical variables measurement"

Statistical treatments of these data have been variable, according to the evaluation of the normality and hence the use of parametric or nonparametric tests. The normality of cnidocyst size data was assumed or proved by some authors who used parametric tests to make comparisons. Other authors carried out nonparametric tests, or even proposed alternative analytical methods, such as the use of generalized linear models. Despite controversy about the statistical distribution of cnidae sizes, there has never been an attempt to study the normality of cnidocyst size data involving a significant volume of samples, using several specimens from various different species and using the same statistical approach. The objective of this paper is to evaluate statistical adjustment to a normal distribution of cnidocyst length from four sea anemone and one corallimorpharian species. The cnidoms of all species are detailed and the hypothesis of no intraspecific variation of cnidae sizes tested as a study case. Normality was accepted in 36.42 % (SD = 17.91) of all data sets of all cnidocyst types analyzed from all studied species, while for the rest it was rejected. The evidence suggests that both normal and non-normal data sets are possible, although non-normality is slightly more frequent. Intraspecific variation of cnidocyst sizes is shown in 96.82 % of the analyzed data sets. This paper provides a simple and detailed methodology to perform comparisons of cnidae size data. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Actiniaria; Cnidom; Corallimorpharia; Generalized linear models; Normal distribution",

The fetal measurements obtained were biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), and femur length (FL). Quantile regression was used to examine the impact of fetal sex across the biometric percentiles of the fetal measurements considered together with parents’ height, weight, parity, and race. Results: Fetal gender resulted to be a significant covariate for BDP, HC, and AC with higher values for male fetuses (p ≤ 0.0009). Minimal differences were found among sexes for FL. Parity, maternal race, paternal height and maternal height, and weight resulted significantly related to the fetal biometric parameters considered independently from fetal gender. Conclusion: In this study, we constructed customized biometric growth charts for fetal sex, parental, and obstetrical characteristics using quantile regression. The use of gender-specific charts offers the advantage to define individualized normal ranges of fetal biometric parameters at each specific centile. This approach may improve the antenatal identification of abnormal fetal growth. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Customized growth chart; fetal biometry; gender difference; quantile regression","abdominal circumference; adult; Article; biparietal distance; body height; body weight; cross-sectional study; echography; female; femur; fetal well being; fetus; fetus growth; fetus monitoring; gestational age; growth curve; head circumference; human; low risk population; male; multicenter study; parity; prenatal diagnosis; priority journal; race; sex difference; biometry; clinical trial; comparative study; fetus development; fetus echography; Italy; physiology; pregnancy; reference value; regression analysis; Biometry; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fetal Development; Gestational Age; Growth Charts; Humans; Italy; Male; Pregnancy; Reference Values; Regression Analysis; Sex Factors; Ultrasonography, Prenatal"

The usage of three main types of acoustic pauses (silent, filled and breath pauses) and syntactic pauses (punctuation marks in speech transcripts) was investigated quantitatively in three types of spontaneous speech (presentations, simultaneous interpretation and radio interviews) and read speech (audio books). Selected parameters of pauses extracted for each speaker separately or for speaker groups were examined statistically to verify usefulness of information on pauses for speaker recognition and speaker profile estimation. Quantity and duration of filled pauses, audible breaths, and correlation between the temporal structure of speech and the syntax structure of the spoken language were the features which characterize speakers most. The experiment of using pauses in speaker biometry system (using Universal Background Model and i-vectors) resulted in 30 % equal error rate. Including pause-related features to the baseline Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient system has not significantly improved its performance. In the experiment with automatic recognition of three types of spontaneous speech, we achieved 78 % accuracy, using GMM classifier. Silent pause-related features allowed distinguishing between read and spontaneous speech by extreme gradient boosting with 75 % accuracy. © 2016, The Author(s).","Biometry; Fillers; Pauses; Polish; Punctuation; Speech classification; Spontaneous speech","Audio acoustics; Fillers; Polishing; Speech; Syntactics; Biometry; Pauses; Punctuation; Speech classification; Spontaneous speech; Speech recognition"

Methods: This was a prospective, cross-sectional study. Complete ophthalmological examination, biometry, and enhanced depth imaging spectral domain optical coherence tomography were performed. Choroidal and individual retinal layer thickness measurements were obtained. Thickness maps for all layers were evaluated using the 1 mm, 3 mm, and 6 mm early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) macular grid areas. Results: One hundred and twenty eyes were included. Choroidal thickness correlated negatively with age in all ETDRS areas. The ganglion cell layer (GCL) in the 1 mm; the GCL and inner plexiform layer (IPL) in the 3 mm and 6 mm; and the GCL, IPL, and inner nuclear layer in the 6 mm areas correlated negatively with age and positively with CT. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in the 6 mm area correlated negatively with age. The retinal pigment epithelium-photoreceptor layer in all areas correlated negatively with age and positively with CT. Conclusion: In normal subjects, vascularized retinal layer thicknesses and outer retinal layer thickness correlate positively with CT and negatively with age. The role of neuronal versus vascular components should be considered when evaluating individual retinal layer thicknesses.","age; choroidal thickness; enhanced depth imaging; ganglion cell layer; glaucoma; myopia; neuro-ophthalmological diseases; outer retinal layers; spectral domain optical coherence tomography; vascularized retinal layers","visual pigment; adult; age distribution; aged; anterior eye segment; Article; best corrected visual acuity; biometry; choroidal thickness; cross-sectional study; diabetic retinopathy; eye fundus; female; human; major clinical study; male; nerve cell; optical coherence tomography device; prospective study; retina macula lutea; retinal inner nuclear layer; retinal inner plexiform layer; retinal nerve fiber layer thickness; retinal outer plexiform layer; retinal pigment epithelium; sex difference; spectral domain optical coherence tomography; aging; anatomy and histology; choroid; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; physiology; procedures; retina; visual acuity; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aging; Choroid; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Retina; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity; Young Adult"

We aimed to investigate the effect of these loci on ocular biometry as a function of age in children, adolescents, and adults. The study population consisted of three age groups identified from the international CREAM consortium: 5,490 individuals aged &lt;10 years; 5,000 aged 10–25 years; and 16,274 aged &gt;25 years. All participants had undergone standard ophthalmic examination including measurements of axial length (AL) and corneal radius (CR). We examined the lead SNP at all 39 currently known genetic loci for refractive error identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as a combined genetic risk score (GRS). The beta coefficient for association between SNP genotype or GRS versus AL/CR was compared across the three age groups, adjusting for age, sex, and principal components. Analyses were Bonferroni-corrected. In the age group &lt;10 years, three loci (GJD2, CHRNG, ZIC2) were associated with AL/CR. In the age group 10–25 years, four loci (BMP2, KCNQ5, A2BP1, CACNA1D) were associated; and in adults 20 loci were associated. Association with GRS increased with age; β = 0.0016 per risk allele (P = 2 × 10–8) in &lt;10 years, 0.0033 (P = 5 × 10–15) in 10- to 25-year-olds, and 0.0048 (P = 1 × 10–72) in adults. Genes with strongest effects (LAMA2, GJD2) had an early effect that increased with age. Our results provide insights on the age span during which myopia genes exert their effect.

Issues Déterminer si la datation par échographie offre une évaluation plus précise de l'âge gestationnel que la datation en fonction des dernières règles avec ou sans recours à l'échographie. Offrir, aux praticiens et aux chercheurs du domaine des soins de maternité, des lignes directrices factuelles en matière d'attribution de l'âge gestationnel. Identifier les paramètres biométriques échographiques qui sont de fiabilité supérieure lorsque l'âge gestationnel est incertain. Déterminer la rentabilité de l'évaluation de l'âge gestationnel par échographie. Résultats La littérature publiée a été récupérée par l'intermédiaire de recherches menées dans PubMed ou MEDLINE et The Cochrane Library en 2013 au moyen d'un vocabulaire contrôlé et de mots clés appropriés (p. ex. « gestational age », « ultrasound biometry » et « ultrasound dating »). Les résultats ont été restreints aux analyses systématiques, aux essais comparatifs randomisés / essais cliniques comparatifs et aux études observationnelles rédigés en anglais. Aucune restriction n'a été appliquée en matière de dates. Les recherches ont été mises à jour de façon régulière et intégrées à la directive clinique jusqu'au 31 juillet 2013. La littérature grise (non publiée) a été identifiée par l'intermédiaire de recherches menées dans les sites Web d'organismes s'intéressant à l'évaluation des technologies dans le domaine de la santé et d'organismes connexes, dans des collections de directives cliniques, dans des registres d'essais cliniques et auprès de sociétés de spécialité médicale nationales et internationales. Valeurs La qualité des résultats est évaluée au moyen des critères décrits dans le rapport du Groupe d'étude canadien sur les soins de santé préventifs (Tableau 1). Avantages, désavantages et coûts L'attribution précise d'un âge gestationnel pourrait réduire l'incidence du déclenchement mené en raison d'une grossesse prolongée et améliorer les soins obstétricaux en nous permettant de planifier la chronologie des interventions nécessaires de façon optimale et d'éviter les interventions inutiles. Une datation plus précise permet l'optimisation de la tenue de tests prénataux de dépistage de l'aneuploïdie. Un algorithme national d'attribution de l'âge gestationnel pourrait atténuer les variations pancanadiennes en matière de pratique pour les cliniciens et les chercheurs. Parmi les désavantages potentiels, on trouve la réattribution possible des dates lorsqu'une pathologie fœtale importante (comme le retard de croissance intra-utérin ou la macrosomie) donne lieu à une divergence entre les résultats de la biométrie échographique et l'âge gestationnel clinique. Une telle réattribution pourrait mener à l'omission d'interventions fœtales justifiées ou à la tenue d'interventions fœtales injustifiées. Déclarations sommaires 1. Le recours isolé à l'échographie, lorsque celle-ci est menée avec précision et dans le respect des normes de qualité, est plus précis que l'utilisation d'une date menstruelle « certaine » pour la détermination de l'âge gestationnel au cours des premier et deuxième trimestres (&lt; 23 semaines) dans les cas de grossesse spontanée; il s'agit de la meilleure méthode pour ce qui est de l'estimation de la date d'accouchement.

En l'absence d'une meilleure évaluation de l'âge gestationnel, la tenue systématique d'une échographie au cours du premier ou du deuxième trimestre entraîne une atténuation du taux de déclenchement mené en raison d'une grossesse post-terme. (I)3. Idéalement, chaque femme enceinte devrait se voir offrir la tenue d'une échographie de datation au cours du premier trimestre; toutefois, lorsque la disponibilité des services d'échographie obstétricale s'avère limitée, il est raisonnable d'avoir recours à une échographie menée au cours du deuxième trimestre pour évaluer l'âge gestationnel. (I)4. Nonobstant les déclarations sommaires 1, 2 et 3, la capacité de percevoir les fonctions internes (dont l'ovulation) varie grandement d'une femme à l'autre; cette perception de l'ovulation par la femme peut parfois être très précise. (III)Recommandations 1. La distance vertex-coccyx au cours du premier trimestre constitue le meilleur paramètre à utiliser pour déterminer l'âge gestationnel; elle devrait être utilisée dans toutes les situations où cela s'avère approprié. (I-A)2. En présence de plus d'une échographie (menée au premier trimestre) ayant permis la mesure du diamètre moyen du sac ou de la distance vertex-coccyx, la première ayant permis de mesurer une distance vertex-coccyx équivalant à au moins sept semaines (ou 10 mm) devrait être utilisée pour déterminer l'âge gestationnel. (III-B)3. Entre la 12e et la 14e semaines, la distance vertex-coccyx et le diamètre bipariétal présentent un degré de précision semblable. Il est recommandé d'utiliser la distance vertex- coccyx jusqu'à 84 mm et d'utiliser le diamètre bipariétal pour ce qui est des mesures supérieures à 84 mm. (II-1A)4. Bien que l'échographie transvaginale puisse permettre une meilleure visualisation des premières structures embryonnaires que celle que permet l'approche transabdominale, son degré de précision n'est pas supérieur à celui de cette dernière pour ce qui est de la détermination de l'âge gestationnel. Qu'elle soit effectuée au moyen d'une échographie transabdominale ou transvaginale, la mesure de la distance vertex-coccyx peut être utilisée pour déterminer l'âge gestationnel. (II-1C)5. Lorsqu'une échographie menée au deuxième ou au troisième trimestre est utilisée pour déterminer l'âge gestationnel, une combinaison de multiples paramètres biométriques (diamètre bipariétal, périmètre tête, périmètre abdominal et longueur du fémur) devrait être utilisée, plutôt que de n'avoir recours qu'à un seul paramètre. (II-1A)6. Lorsque l'attribution de l'âge gestationnel se fonde sur une échographie menée au troisième trimestre, il est difficile de confirmer avec précision la date prévue de l'accouchement. De deux à trois semaines à la suite de cette échographie, il est recommandé de procéder à une échographie de suivi permettant d'évaluer la croissance ayant eu lieu pendant l'intervalle entre les échographies.

Design Retrospective consecutive case series. Participants Three hundred four eyes (276 patients) implanted with acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs) were divided randomly into a training set (152 eyes) and a validation set (152 eyes). Methods Based on the training set data, the postoperative ACD measured 1 month after surgery was analyzed via multiple linear regression analysis with 5 preoperatively measured variables: ATA depth, ATA width, preoperative ACD measured with AS OCT, axial length (AL), and corneal power. A new regression formula for predicting postoperative ACD was developed using the results of the stepwise analysis. In the validation set data, the coefficients of determination (R2) between the measured postoperative ACD and the predicted postoperative ACD obtained using the new formula were compared with those obtained using the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff theoretic (SRK/T) and Haigis formulas. The absolute prediction errors were compared with each formula. Main Outcome Measures Postoperative ACD, median absolute prediction error of postoperative ACD, and ocular biometric parameters. Results In the training set, ATA depth yielded the highest standard partial regression coefficient value, indicating that ATA depth is the most effective parameter for predicting postoperative ACD. The new regression formula was developed with 3 variables; ATA depth, preoperative ACD, and AL. In the validation set, the postoperative ACDs of the new formula, the SRK/T formula, and Haigis formula were predicted with R2 of 0.71, 0.36, and 0.55, respectively, and the medians of the absolute prediction errors were 0.10 mm, 0.65 mm, and 0.30 mm, respectively. The absolute prediction error with the new formula was significantly smaller than those obtained with the SRK/T and Haigis formulas (P &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions The new formula with 3 preoperative parameters—ATA depth, preoperative ACD, and AL—predicted postoperative ACD more accurately than the SRK/T and Haigis formulas. It may be possible to improve the accuracy of IOL power calculation using an improved postoperative ACD prediction with the ATA depth measured by AS OCT. © 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology",,"adult; aged; anterior eye chamber depth; anterior eye segment; calculation; case study; cataract; cataract extraction; Conference Paper; controlled study; cornea curvature; female; human; lens implant; major clinical study; male; measurement accuracy; optical coherence tomography; postoperative period; prediction; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; retrospective study; algorithm; anterior eye chamber; biometry; ciliary body; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; iris; lens implantation; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; optics; pathology; postoperative period; procedures; randomized controlled trial; regression analysis; reproducibility; trabecular meshwork; validation study; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Anterior Chamber; Biometry; Cataract Extraction; Ciliary Body; Female; Humans; Iris; Lens Implantation, Intraocular; Lenses, Intraocular; Male; Middle Aged; Optics and Photonics; Postoperative Period; Regression Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Trabecular Meshwork"

Forty-two healthy hyperopic anisometropic cases (1 D mean spherical equivalent difference between eyes) without strabismus were recruited. A range of refractive and ultrasonic biometric parameters were measured in both eyes of each subject including keratometry, mean spherical equivalent, anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness, vitreous depth (VD), axial length (AL), and anterior segment parameters (central corneal thickness (CCT), ACD, anterior chamber volume (ACV)) with Pentacam. Mean spherical equivalent anisometropia was 2.66 ± 1.233 (range 1.125 and 6.25) D, and there was a strong correlation between the degree of anisometropia and the interocular difference in AL (r = 0.632, P &lt; 0.001). A total of 61.3 % of the anisometropia was related with AL (50.7 %) and mean keratometry (10.6 %). Every 1 mm change in AL and every 1 D change in mean keratometry caused a total of 2.82 D and 2.14 D refractive difference, respectively. Among Pentacam parameters, ACD was correlated with ACV (r = 0.528; P &lt; 0.001) and AL (r = 0.510; P = 0.001); ACV was correlated with VD (r = 0.358; P = 0.020); and CCT was correlated with ACV (r = 0.510; P = 0.001) and AL (r = 0.318; P = 0.040). Among ultrasonographic measurements, ultrasonic-ACD was correlated with CCT (r = 0.510; P = 0.001) and lens thickness (r = −0.556; P &lt; 0.001), and VD was correlated with AL (r = 0.937, r2 = 0.877, P &lt; 0.001). The hyperopic and the fellow eyes displayed a high degree of interocular symmetry for the other measured parameters. AL and mean keratometry are the leading causes of hyperopic anisometropia.

The bionomy of Kerteszia mosquitoes can contribute to foundation landscape ecology by virtue of in the role of the configuration and composition of the habitat played in the distribution of mosquito species. Thus, this study aimed: to compare the abundance of Kerteszia in dense tropical rainforest, restinga and rural area, to assess the bioecological characteristics of the main bromeliads hosting Kerteszia, and to associate the bioecological arrangement of the bromeliads with Kerteszia distribution. Field collections were conducted in a monthly schedule from December of 2010 to November 2011. The vegetation of landscapes was characterized on the basis of a digital cartographic database, the manual of the Brazilian vegetation, environmental atlas information, satellite images and visits to the sites. Multivariate generalized linear models were employed using the R-project statistical program. The results were: Anopheles cruzii was the most frequent species in dense tropical rainforest (67.42%), with a positive association (deviance = 25.8; P = 0.002). Anopheles bellator was more abundant in the Restinga area (78.97%), with a positive association (deviance = 10.4, P = 0.018). There was a positive aggregation of Restinga with An. bellator (RR = 2.42) but a lower level with An. cruzii (RR = 0.31). Thus we can conclude that landscape characteristics influence the distribution of Kerteszia mosquitoes. An. bellator has a higher prevalence in Restinga areas, whereas An. cruzii was the most prevalent in the dense tropical rainforest. © 2016","Abundance; Anopheles bellator; Anopheles cruzii; Dense tropical rainforest; Distribution; Ecological niche; Microhabitat; Restinga; Scale","Anopheles; data base; ecological niche; landscape ecology; microhabitat; nonhuman; prevalence; rural area; satellite imagery; species; statistical model; tropical rain forest; vegetation; animal; Anopheles; biometry; Brazil; Bromelia; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; rain forest; Anopheles bellator; Anopheles cruzii; Bellator; Culicidae; Diptera; Kerteszia; Animals; Anopheles; Biometry; Brazil; Bromelia; Ecosystem; Rainforest"

Methods: Forty-one consecutive patients with PEX glaucoma and 41 age- and sex-matched normal subjects were enrolled. All subjects underwent imaging with SD-OCT. The SC length and SC area were examined in the temporal sections and measured with customized software. Results: The percentages of the temporal sections in which SC was observable were similar between the two groups. Mean SC length was found significantly shorter, and mean SC area was found significantly smaller in patients with PEX glaucoma than in controls (p = 0.044 and p = 0.036, respectively). Mean intra-ocular pressure (IOP) values were also similar between two groups. No significant correlations were found between SC measurements and IOP.

Procedures Eighty-one eyes of 81 patients evaluated for cataract surgery were prospectively examined using the IOLMaster 700© before and after pupil dilation with tropicamide 1%. The measurements made were: axial length (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT), aqueous chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT), mean keratometry (MK), white-to-white distance (WTW) and pupil diameter (PD). Holladay II and SRK/T formulas were used to calculate IOL power. Agreement between measurement modes (with and without dilation) was assessed through intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. Results Mean patient age was 75.17 ± 7.54 years (range: 57–92). Of the variables determined, CCT, ACD, LT and WTW varied significantly according to pupil dilation. Excellent intraobserver correlation was observed between measurements made before and after pupil dilation. Mean IOL power calculation using the Holladay 2 and SRK/T formulas were unmodified by pupil dilation.

Methods: Refraction of 117 monozygotic (MZ) and 116 dizygotic (DZ) female twin subjects aged 66–79 years was assessed with an auto-refractor (Topcon AT) and controlled by subjective refraction. Corneal refraction, anterior chamber depth and axial length were measured with a Zeiss IOL Master. Participants with eyes operated for cataract or glaucoma were excluded, but the grade of nuclear opacity was not recorded. The associations between the absolute values of AnisoSR, AnisoAST and AnisoSE with SR, AST, SE, corneal refractive power (CR), corneal astigmatism (CAST), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and axial length (AL) and with their interocular differences were calculated. When calculating the interdependencies of the differences, the real and absolute differences between the right and left eye were used. Results: Means ± standard deviations for AnisoSR, AnisoAST and AnisoSE were 0.67 ± 0.92 D, 0.42 ± 0.41 D and 0.65 ± 0.71 D, respectively. AnisoSR, AnisoAST and AnisoSE >1.0 D were present in 14.7%, 4.2% and 17.7% of cases, respectively. Anisometropia of spherical refraction (AnisoSR), AnisoAST and AnisoSE were higher the more negative the values of SR or SE. Hyperopic ametropia did not increase these anisometropia values. The correlations of AnisoSR and AnisoSE with the absolute values of interocular differences in CR and AL were non-significant. Using the real values of the interocular differences, the respective correlations were significant. The correlation between the real interocular differences in CR and AL was negative (r = −0.258, p < 0.001). Thus, the combined effect of the real interocular differences in CR and AL was a decrease in AnisoSR and AnisoSE (emmetropization). Conclusion: Higher AnisoSR and AnisoSE were associated with more myopic refraction and longer AL. Higher AnisoAST was associated with more negative SR and higher AST and CAST.

It can be performed using radiographic techniques, if antemortem images are available. This study was designed to assess the value of visual comparison of the computed tomography (CT) anatomical aspects of the sphenoid sinuses, in forensic individual identification, especially if antemortem dental records, fingerprints or DNA samples are not available. Material and methods This retrospective work took place in a French university hospital. The supervisor of this study randomly selected from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS), 58 patients who underwent one (16 patients) or two (42 patients) head CT in various neurological contexts. To avoid bias, those studies were prepared (anonymized, and all the head structures but the sphenoid sinuses were excluded), and used to constitute two working lists of 50 (42 + 8) CT studies of the sphenoid sinuses. An anatomical classification system of the sphenoid sinuses anatomical variations was created based on the anatomical and surgical literature. In these two working lists, three blinded readers had to identify, using the anatomical system and subjective visual comparison, 42 pairs of matched studies, and 16 unmatched studies. Readers were blinded from the exact numbers of matching studies. Results Each reader correctly identified the 42 pairs of CT with a concordance of 100% [97.5% confidence interval: 91–100%], and the 16 unmatched CT with a concordance of 100% [97.5% confidence interval: 79–100%]. Overall accuracy was 100%. Conclusion Our study shows that establishing the anatomical concordance of the sphenoid sinuses by visual comparison could be used in personal identification.

A random pre-warping framework is adopted to make the scheme robust to collusion attack. The experiments were conducted with and without attacks and was proved that the algorithms are able to resist the attacks. A comparison between the two feature selection algorithms was also performed based on the number of feature points detected with and without attacks. Both the algorithms prove that they are efficient in terms of fingerprint embedding and extraction and can resist various image processing and geometric attacks.

However, face identification from uncontrolled pose remains a challenging open problem in biometric recognition. Recently, pose invariant techniques that exploit either 3D scans or 2D images of the same face to generate the corresponding 3D model have emerged. Even if they tolerate pose variability and lead to high identification scores, they have the drawback to be computationally intensive and/or require the cooperation of the individual to be identified. Hence, they are not appropriate for the interesting real-time application of video surveillance. In this paper, we propose a profile face identification method based on correspondence mapping of 2D frontal face images. Kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) is used to learn changeover from the profile pose to the frontal one. To show the effectiveness of our approach, tests are performed on FERET database according to a protocol referred to as leave one out-like protocol (LOOLP). These tests demonstrate that it leads to enhanced scores comparatively to other 2D-based methods proposed in the literature. © 2016, The Author(s).","Biometry; Frontal face; KCCA; LBP; Profile face identification","Security systems; Biometric recognition; Biometry; Face identification; Frontal faces; KCCA; Kernel canonical correlation analysis; Profile faces; Real-time application; Face recognition"

Methods In this prospective study, 115 eyes of 115 patients with angle closure disease were included and categorized into three groups: 1) fellow eyes of acute angle closure (AAC; 40 eyes); 2) primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG; 39 eyes); and 3) primary angle closure suspect (PACS; 36 eyes). Complete ophthalmic examination including gonioscopy, A-scan biometry, and AS-OCT were performed. Based on the AS-OCT images, 4 mechanisms of PAC including pupillary block, plateau iris configuration, thick peripheral iris roll (PIR), and exaggerated lens vault were evaluated. Angle, AC, and lens parameter variables were also evaluated among the three subtypes. Results There was a statistically significant difference in the mechanism of angle closure among the three groups (p = 0.03). While the majority of fellow eyes of AAC and of PACS eyes had pupillary block mechanism (77.5% and 75%, respectively), only 48.7% of PACG eyes had dominant pupillary block mechanism (p = 0.03). The percentage of exaggerated lens vault and plateau iris mechanisms was higher in PACG eyes (25.5% and 15.4%, respectively). Fellow eyes of AAC had the shallowest AC (p = 0.01), greater iris curvature (p = 0.01), and lens vault (p = 0.02) than PACS and PACG eyes. Iris thickness was not significantly different among the three groups (p = 0.45). Conclusion Using AS-OCT, we found that there was a statistically significant difference in the underlying PAC mechanisms and quantitative AC parameters among the three subtypes of angle closure disease. © 2016 Iranian Society of Ophthalmology","Angle closure; Anterior segment optical coherence tomography; Glaucoma; Iris curvature; Lens vault",

However, some apparently monomorphic species have small but measurable sexual dimorphisms in biometry, which can be used to determine sex. Here, we develop a method based on multivariate probabilities to improve sexing in three Phylloscopus species. We captured 16 124 Common Chiffchaffs (P. collybita), Iberian Chiffchaffs (P. ibericus) and Willow Warblers (P. trochilus) during postnuptial migration in the Doñana National Park (SW Spain). We estimated the probability of them being male or female based on a combination of the density distributions of wing and tarsus lengths. Density distributions were derived as two normal components of the mixture distribution in both traits. Discriminatory ability was compared under different assumptions. 95% of Common Chiffchaffs, 92% of Iberian Chiffchaffs and 87% of Willow Warblers were sexed with 95% confidence. These percentages are greater than those reported for these species using sexing methods based only on wing length. Our method was not affected by changes between years in the degree of dimorphism or mixture of populations from different geographical origins. In the Iberian Chiffchaff and the Willow Warbler, sexing was improved when our method was applied to immatures and adults separately. Sex ratio was estimated to be two females per male in the Common Chiffchaff and the Willow Warbler. In the latter species, females migrated one week later than males. Sex ratio in the Iberian Chiffchaff was 1:1. Our sexing method could be used for other species with known and apparent dimorphism or to any data set of birds with biometric measures. © 2016 British Trust for Ornithology.",,"Aves; Phylloscopus; Phylloscopus collybita; Phylloscopus ibericus; Phylloscopus trochilus"

This paper presents an effective and efficient approach to dorsal hand vein recognition. In contrast to the majority of existing methods, which either make use of texture features or shape features, this method highlights that their joint use improves the distinctiveness of the dorsal hand vein image so that it can be better distinguished from the ones of other subjects. A novel shape representation method is proposed to describe the geometry structure of the venous network, by integrating both local and holistic analyses. Its similarity measurement is then hierarchically combined with that from the texture modality, generated by the well reputed texture operator, namely Local Binary Patterns (LBP), for decision making. To validate the proposed approach, extensive experiments are conducted on NCUT, one of the largest publicly available dorsal hand vein databases, and the results achieved are superior to the state of the art ones so far reported in the literature, which demonstrates its effectiveness. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biometrics; Fusion; Hand vein recognition; Shape modeling; Texture representation","Biometrics; Decision making; Fusion reactions; Image segmentation; Geometry structure; Hand vein recognition; Liveness detection; Local binary patterns; Shape model; Shape representation; Similarity measurements; Texture representation; Palmprint recognition; algorithm; Article; binary coding; biometry; controlled study; data base; dorsal hand vein recognition; factorized graph matching; female; Gaussian matched filter; geometry; graph; human; image segmentation; local binary pattern; male; Niblack method; noise reduction; normal human; priority journal; shape based; texture based; validation process; Yasuda method"

The persistence of its small populations depends often on few adults, which makes it is highly vulnerable to limiting recruitment factors. In this paper, we examined the regeneration status of this maple in three populations through its geographical distribution in the mountain range of the Tunisian dorsal (Jbel Srerej national park and sacred site). Morphological parameters, genetic variability, and diversity were analyzed as species viability indicators. The ecological site of maple was studied based on the soil texture and structure under the population, additionally to the role of shrubs as nurse plants in maple regeneration dynamic. Here, the maple population in Tunisia was investigated for the first time. The results show that Acer monspessulanum population has a variation terms of height, stem diameter and crown diameter, it also shows that there is a good natural regeneration. Analysis of the soil’s physicochemical parameters showed that the species grows on sandy loam and clay loam soil, shallow and slightly alkaline pH.

This study characterises the C. symmetricus shell utilisation pattern in the Marapanim River estuary, ParÃ¡, Equatorial Amazon, based on the hypothesis that occupancy patterns would differ, in relation to biometry and diversity of occupied shells, from those of other regions in the range of this species due to the distinct and unique environmental characteristics of equatorial estuaries. Monthly samplings were carried out from August 2006 to July 2007, in the upper and lower areas of the mid-littoral during low tides. A total of seven gastropod species were found as shells occupied by hermit crabs: 93.33% were Thaisella trinitatensis shells, 2.00% Nassarius vibex, 2.00% Neritina virginea, 1.33% Natica marochiensis, 0.67% Parvanachis obesa, and, occasionally, Littorina flava and Phalium granulatum shells, each with only one occurrence (0.33%). Juveniles [cephalothoracic shield length (CL) of less than 3.6Â mm] occupied a higher variety of shells, while adults occupied shells with larger meristic variation. Males occupied larger shells. The length of the animal was influenced by shell measurements (total width, aperture width and weight). Clibanarius symmetricus showed occupancy patterns generally similar to those of specimens of the same species previously studied in the Brazilian subtropical region, and this occupancy is explained by shell availability, shell size and weight, and hermit size. However, this study showed lower occupied shell species diversity, and the species with highest occupancy frequency (T. trinitatensis) was not reported in any previous studies on this hermit crab. In addition, the studied population differed in occupancy patterns, with differences between males and females, and between juveniles and adults.

Data were collected at the preoperative, operative, 1-day and 2-month postoperative visits. The primary outcome measure was the manifest refractive astigmatism magnitude at 2 months. The secondary outcome measures included the manifest refraction, corneal keratometry, and distance visual acuity (corrected and uncorrected). The results obtained with the Barrett toric calculator were compared with simulated results based on the toric calculators designed for the IOLs being used. Results: Data from 98 eyes of 54 subjects were available for analysis. In the 74 eyes with postoperative lens orientation as planned, and sufficient IOL cylinder power to correct sub-jects’ measured astigmatism, 77% of eyes (57/74) had 0.5 diopter (D) or less refractive cylinder 2 months postoperatively, while 89% (66/74) had 0.75 D or less. Simulated results after adjusting actual IOL orientation to the planned orientation suggested that the Barrett calculator would result in postoperative residual astigmatism about 0.2 D lower than that expected with standard calculators. Conclusion: Use of the Barrett toric calculator with biometry data from the Lenstar LS900 biometer for toric IOL planning in a clinical setting resulted in significantly lower levels of residual refractive cylinder than might be expected with standard calculators. Postoperative lens orientation and variability in the measurement of corneal astigmatism pre- and postoperatively appear to be important limiting factors in toric IOL outcomes. © 2016 Gundersen and Potvin.","Astigmatism; Cataract surgery; Cylinder; Keratometry; Lenstar; Toric IOL",

Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in developing electronic approaches to addressing this problem, with mobile technology at the forefront of these efforts. We investigate the possibility of biometrics as a simple, cost-efficient, and portable solution. Common biometrics approaches include fingerprinting, iris scanning and facial recognition, but all are less than ideal due to complexity, infringement on privacy, cost, or portability. Ear biometrics, however, proved to be a unique and viable solution.METHODS: We developed an identification algorithm then conducted a cross sectional study in which we photographed left and right ears from 25 consenting adults. We then conducted re-identification and statistical analyses to identify the accuracy and replicability of our approach.RESULTS: Through principal component analysis, we found the curve of the ear helix to be the most reliable anatomical structure and the basis for re-identification. Although an individual ear allowed for high re-identification rate (88.3%), when both left and right ears were paired together, our rate of re-identification amidst the pool of potential matches was 100%.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study have implications on future efforts towards building a biometrics solution for patient identification in LMICs. We provide a conceptual platform for further investigation into the development of an ear biometrics identification mobile application.",,"adult; aged; algorithm; anatomy and histology; biometry; Black person; Caucasian; cross-sectional study; developing country; ear; global health; human; middle aged; patient identification; principal component analysis; procedures; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; Aged; Algorithms; Biometric Identification; Cross-Sectional Studies; Developing Countries; Ear; European Continental Ancestry Group; Global Health; Humans; Middle Aged; Patient Identification Systems; Principal Component Analysis"

Methods: A cohort study of 3, 971 women with singleton pregnancies was conducted from the first trimester until delivery with 3, 440 pregnancies (17, 334 scans) meeting the following inclusion criteria: 1) delivery of a live neonate after 33 gestational weeks and 2) two or more ultrasound examinations with fetal biometry parameters obtained at &lt;36 weeks. Primary outcomes were SGA (&lt;5th centile) and LGA (&gt;95th centile) at birth based on INTERGROWTH-21st gender-specific standards. Fetus-specific estimated fetal weight (EFW) trajectories were calculated by linear mixed-effects models using data up to a fixed gestational age (GA) cutoff (28, 32, or 36 weeks) for fetuses having two or more measurements before the GA cutoff and not already delivered. A screen test positive for single biometry was based on Z-scores of EFW at the last scan before each GA cut-off so that the false positive rate (FPR) was 10%. Similarly, a screen test positive for the longitudinal analysis was based on the projected (extrapolated) EFW at 40 weeks from all available measurements before each cutoff for each fetus. Results: Fetal abdominal and head circumference measurements, as well as birth weights in the Detroit population, matched well to the INTERGROWTH-21st standards, yet this was not the case for biparietal diameter (BPD) and femur length (FL) (up to 9% and 10% discrepancy for mean and confidence intervals, respectively), mainly due to differences in the measurement technique. Single biometry based on EFW at the last scan at ≤32 weeks (GA IQR: 27.4-30.9 weeks) had a sensitivity of 50% and 53% (FPR = 10%) to detect preterm and term SGA and LGA neonates, respectively (AUC of 82% both). For the detection of LGA using data up to 32- and 36-week cutoffs, single biometry analysis had higher sensitivity than longitudinal analysis (52% vs 46% and 62% vs 52%, respectively; both p&lt;0.05). Restricting the analysis to subjects with the last observation taken within two weeks from the cutoff, the sensitivity for detection of LGA, but not SGA, increased to 65% and 72% for single biometry at the 32- and 36-week cutoffs, respectively. SGA screening performance was higher for preterm (&lt;37 weeks) than for term cases (73% vs 46% sensitivity; p&lt;0.05) for single biometry at ≤32 weeks. Conclusions: When growth abnormalities are defined based on birth weight, growth velocity (captured in the longitudinal analysis) does not provide additional information when compared to the last measurement for predicting SGA and LGA neonates, with both approaches detecting one-half of the neonates (FPR = 10%) from data collected at ≤32 weeks. Unlike for SGA, LGA detection can be improved if ultrasound scans are scheduled as close as possible to the gestational-age cutoff when a decision regarding the clinical management of the patient needs to be made. Screening performance for SGA is higher for neonates that will be delivered preterm. © 2016 Huda et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"adult; biometry; birth weight; cohort analysis; female; fetus echography; fetus weight; gestational age; human; intrauterine growth retardation; longitudinal study; newborn; pathophysiology; physiology; predictive value; pregnancy; procedures; risk assessment; small for date infant; term birth; third trimester pregnancy; young adult; Adult; Biometry; Birth Weight; Cohort Studies; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Fetal Weight; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Small for Gestational Age; Longitudinal Studies; Predictive Value of Tests; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Risk Assessment; Term Birth; Ultrasonography, Prenatal; Young Adult"

Methods: This was a prospective screening study of 70 003 singleton pregnancies including 69 735 live births and 268 (0.38%) antepartum stillbirths; 159 (59%) were secondary to impaired placentation and 109 (41%) were due to other or unexplained causes. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to develop a model for prediction of stillbirth based on a combination of maternal factors, fetal biometry and UtA-PI. Results: Combined screening predicted 55% of all stillbirths, including 75% of those due to impaired placentation and 23% of those that were unexplained or due to other causes, at a false-positive rate of 10%. Within the impaired placentation group, the detection rate of stillbirth &lt; 32 weeks' gestation was higher than that of stillbirth ≥ 37 weeks (88% vs 46%; P &lt; 0.001).

Methods A total of 60 eyes from 60 highly myopic individuals (defined as a mean spherical equivalent refraction of -6.00 D or greater and axial length ≥26 mm) underwent detailed ophthalmic examination. Twenty-one eyes (13 females and 8 males; mean age: 29 ± 7 years) with tilted optic discs were recruited and compared with 39 eyes (23 females and 16 males; mean age: 28 ± 6 years) of control subjects without tilted optic discs using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and the Lenstar biometer. Disc ovality was assessed using the ratio of minimum to maximum disc diameter (index of tilt). A ratio of ≤0.80 was considered as a tilted optic disc. Results There were no significant differences in biometric parameters between two groups. However, myopia in the tilted disc group was significantly greater compared to the non-tilted group (-8.82 ± 1.58 D vs. -7.84 ± 1.22 D, p = 0.01). Comparison of OCT sectoral macular nerve fiber layer measurements between groups showed significant differences in inner ring thicknesses for the nasal (p = 0.01), inferior (p < 0.001), and temporal (p = 0.04) quadrants. A significant difference was also seen in outer ring macular nerve fiber layer thickness for the temporal quadrant (p = 0.03). No significant differences were demonstrated in optic disc peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness between the two groups. Conclusions Mean spherical equivalent refractive error is strongly correlated with optic disc tilt; however, other biometric factors are independent of tilt. Structural examination of the eye using OCT can be employed to differentiate between eyes with tilted optic discs and those with normal discs. Peripapillary RNFL appears to be unaffected by tilted discs. © Copyright 2016 American Academy of Optometry.","high myopia; ocular biometry; optical coherence tomography; tilted optic disc","Biometrics; Coherent light; Edge detection; Ophthalmology; Tomography; Biometric factors; Biometric parameters; Mean spherical equivalents; Nerve fiber layers; Refractive error; Retinal nerve fiber layers; Spectral domain optical coherence tomographies; Structural examination; Optical tomography"

Design: Prospective cohort study. Participants: Of the 5190 participants of Phase I, 4737 participated in Phase II (response rate = 91.3%). Methods: Participants were tested by refraction, visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy and biometry. Myopia was defined as a spherical equivalent more negative than −0.5 dioptre (D) and hyperopia as a spherical equivalent more positive than +0.5 D. Main Outcome Measures: Mean 5-year change in spherical equivalent refraction. Results: The mean 5-year change in spherical equivalent refraction was +0.24 D (95% CI: +0.22 to +0.25). After 5 years, 4.77% (95% CI: 4.08 to 5.46) of subjects developed at least 0.5 D of myopia and 22.27% (95% CI: 20.97 to 23.57) developed at least 0.5 D of hyperopia. Five-year changes in refraction included a hyperopic shift in all age groups. The greatest hyperopic shift was seen in middle-aged women. The greatest loss of lens power was observed in hyperopic women and the least in myopic men. Nuclear cataract was associated with a myopic shift in refraction. The axial length and the corneal power had very small changes during this period. Myopes showed the greatest increase in axial length. Corneal power increased by a very small amount in all refractive groups.

Observed and predicted measurements of the cerebellar vermis were recorded. Neurologic outcome was classified as normal or abnormal. Unpaired t-tests and discriminate analysis were applied to the two measurements and differences between the observed and predicted values. Results: The reference group included 64 fetuses of 13 to 38 weeks gestation. Both vermis length and inferior vermian distance increased linearly with time (r = 0.92, P < 0.001; r = 0.32, P = 0.01). The prospective group included 64 additional fetuses with documented normal (39/64, 61%) and abnormal (25/64, 39%) outcomes. Significant differences were seen in vermis length, inferior vermian distance, and correlation with predicted values based on neurologic outcome (P < 0.001). Vermis length discrepancy ≥ 4 mm or inferior vermian distance ≥ 4 mm were associated with abnormal neurologic outcome. Conclusion: MR measurements of a short, raised vermis characterized by a vermis length discrepancy ≥ 4 mm or an inferior vermian distance ≥ 4 mm is associated with abnormal neurologic, syndromic, and developmental outcomes.

Material and methods: Retrospective cohort study; 23 894 singleton pregnancies routinely scanned between 19 and 24 weeks’ gestation. Maternal characteristics included age, body mass index, ethnicity and medical history. Fetal biometry indices, birthweight and uterine artery pulsatility index values were converted to percentiles and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. The predictive accuracy was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves analysis. The main outcome was prediction of preterm and term stillbirths. Results: Non-Caucasian ethnicity, femur length centile and uterine artery pulsatility index were significantly associated with the risk of stillbirth (all p < 0.01). The detection rate of screening by maternal factors alone was 19% for all stillbirths, and 12 and 14% for term and preterm stillbirth at a 10% false positive rate, respectively. Using femur length centile alone, the detection rates were 27 and 23%, respectively. Uterine artery pulsatility index alone was able to predict 24 and 31% of term and preterm stillbirths. Screening by combining maternal factors, femur length centile and uterine artery Doppler detected 27 and 35% of term and preterm stillbirths at a 10% false positive rate. Conclusions: Second trimester ultrasound assessment offers an opportunity to identify pregnancies at the highest risk of stillbirth occurring as a consequence of placental dysfunction. This information may be useful to improve pregnancy outcome by identifying women who may benefit from increased ultrasound surveillance and/or timely intervention. © 2016 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology","femur length; fetal biometry; Second trimester screening; stillbirth; uterine artery Dopplers","adult; decision support system; diagnostic imaging; Doppler ultrasonography; embryology; female; femur; fetus development; fetus echography; follow up; human; pathophysiology; Placental Insufficiency; pregnancy; procedures; pulsatile flow; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; second trimester pregnancy; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; stillbirth; uterine artery; Adult; Decision Support Techniques; Female; Femur; Fetal Development; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Logistic Models; Placental Insufficiency; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Pulsatile Flow; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stillbirth; Ultrasonography, Doppler; Ultrasonography, Prenatal; Uterine Artery"

Design: Population-based cross-sectional study. Participants: A total of 2893 seven-year-old children from 11 randomly selected primary schools in Anyang, central China. Methods: Participants underwent ophthalmic examinations including optical biometry, cycloplegic autorefraction and spectral-domain ocular coherence tomography. Main Outcome Measures: Retinal nerve fibre layer thickness in 16 radial sections, cycloplegic spherical equivalent, AL. Results: The mean (SD) average RNFL thickness was 102.01(8.02) µm. The average RNFL thickness decreased with smaller disc area (r = 0.18, R2 = 0.03, P &lt; 0.0001), bigger cup area (r = −0.11, R2 = 0.01, P &lt; 0.0001), smaller rim area (r = 0.28, R2 = 0.08, P &lt; 0.0001), smaller nerve head volume (r = 0.27, R2 = 0.07, P &lt; 0.0001), longer AL (r = −0.15, R2 = 0.02, P &lt; 0.0001) and a negative spherical equivalent (r = 0.11, R2 = 0.01, P &lt; 0.0001). Hyperopic children had a thicker RNFL than emmetropic children [102.45(8.13) µm vs. 100.81 (7.18) µm, P &lt; 0.001]. Myopic children had thinner RNFL than emmetropic children [99.17 (7.69) µm vs. 100.81 (7.18) µm, P &lt; 0.05]. Conclusion: Retinal nerve fibre layer thickness decreased with increasing AL, higher myopia, bigger cup area, smaller disc and rim area, and a smaller nerve head volume, but the coefficient of determination for all these associations was small. The RNFL in myopes was significantly thinner than emmetropes or hyperopes, but with small absolute differences. The study provides RNFL values for healthy 7-year-old Chinese children.

The patients were divided into 3 groups in terms of the degree of the mastoid pneumatization. The mastoid pneumatization was measured between 0 and 5 cm for group A, between 5 and 10 cm for group B, and ≥10 cm for group C. The ETa and ETl of each group were compared.RESULTS: The mean mastoid pneumatization of groups A, B, and C was 4.32 ± 1.96, 8.26 ± 2.68, and 11.94 ± 1.28 cm, respectively. The ETl of group A was lower than that of other groups statistically (P = 0.006 and 0.018, respectively). The mean ETl did not differ between the groups B and C (P = 0.698, >0.05, respectively). The ETa of each group did not differ (all P > 0.05). The mastoid pneumatization and the ETl were higher in males than in females (P = 0.004 and 0.001, respectively). The ETa did not differ between males and females (P = 0.0158). There was a positive correlation between the degree of the mastoid pneumatization and the ETl (r = 0.159/P = 0.002, <0.05, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The present study is thus the first to analyze the relationship between the degree of the mastoid pneumatization and the ETa and the ETl.

Methods: Visual acuity (VA), refraction, optic disc parameters, biometric values and anthropometric measures were obtained from 50 eight-year-old MLP and 43 full-term children. Macular parameters were examined by optical coherence tomography. Serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels were analysed at birth and at assessment and delta IGF-I was calculated. Results: Total macular volume was significantly less in MLP than in controls (both eyes p < 0.01). Macular volume correlated with head circumference (HCF) at assessment [right eye (RE) p = 0.002, r = 0.67; left eyes (LE) p = 0.01, r = 0.54] and refraction (both eyes p < 0.05, r = 0.4) in the MLP children. Furthermore, central retinal thickness correlated significantly with delta IGF-I (RE p = 0.03, r = −0.51, LE p = 0.006, r = −0.59) and refraction (both eyes p < 0.01, r = 0.5) and optic disc areas correlated with weight and height at assessment (all p < 0.05, r = 0.4). Total axial length correlated with HCF at assessment (both eyes p < 0.01, r = 0.5) and VA logMAR (both eyes p < 0.02, r = −0.4).

Design: Prospective study. Participants: Thirty-five subjects with PACG and thirty-three subjects with POAG who required trabeculectomy were enrolled at the Singapore National Eye Centre, Singapore. Methods: Iris specimens, obtained by iridectomy, were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction for expression of type I collagen, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, -B and -C, as well as VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) 1 and 2. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) imaging for biometric parameters, including anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber volume (ACV) and lens vault (LV), was also performed pre-operatively. Main Outcome Measures: Relative mRNA levels between PACG and POAG irises, biometric measurements, discriminant analyses using genes and biometric parameters. Results: COL1A1, VEGFB, VEGFC and VEGFR2 mRNA expression was higher in PACG compared to POAG irises. LV, ACD and ACV were significantly different between the two subgroups. Discriminant analyses based on gene expression, biometric parameters or a combination of both gene expression and biometrics (LV and ACV), correctly classified 94.1%, 85.3% and 94.1% of the original PACG and POAG cases, respectively. The discriminant function combining genes and biometrics demonstrated the highest accuracy in cross-validated classification of the two glaucoma subtypes. Conclusions: Distinct iris gene expression supports the pathophysiological differences that exist between PACG and POAG. Biometric parameters can combine with iris gene expression to more accurately define PACG from POAG. © 2016 The Authors.

We compared the anterior segment characteristics of congenital cataract (CC) patients with lens opacities in different locations and proposed a modified, simple CC category system. METHODS. Cataractous eyes of CC patients were classified into four groups based on the locations of lens opacities shown in slit-lamp examinations and by a 3-dimensional anterior segment imaging system as follows: total, anterior, interior, and posterior cataracts. The mean keratometry value, corneal astigmatism (CA), central corneal thickness (CCT), and anterior chamber depth (ACD) of eyes in different groups were compared. RESULTS. We included a total of 428 CC patients. Half of the patients with an anterior cataract had the complication of a pupillary residual membrane. Among the patients with posterior lentiglobus cataracts, 90.38% had unilateral involvement. Patients with total, anterior, or interior cataracts had larger keratometry values than those with either posterior cataracts or clear lens. Congenital cataract patients had greater CA and CCT values than those with a clear lens. The largest CA was presented in patients with anterior cataracts, and the value decreased gradually with more posterior locations of lens opacities. Eyes with total and anterior cataracts had smaller ACDs, and eyes with interior and posterior cataracts had greater ACDs than eyes with a clear lens. CONCLUSIONS. Cataractous eyes in CC patients with lens opacities in different locations presented distinct anterior segment characteristics. The modified CC category system, based on the relationships among the locations of lens opacities and anterior segment characteristics, may be beneficial for CC diagnosis and treatment. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

Though errors in estimation of corneal power can cause IOL calculation errors in eyes with normal corneas, greater difficulties in measuring corneal power are encountered in eyes with diseased, scarred, and postsurgical corneas. For these corneas, problematic issues are quantifying anterior corneal power and measuring posterior corneal power and astigmatism. Results in these eyes are improving, but 2 examples illustrate current limitations: (1) spherical accuracy within 0.5 D is achieved in only 70% of eyes with post–refractive surgery corneas, and (2) astigmatism accuracy within 0.5 D is achieved in only 80% of eyes implanted with toric IOLs. Conclusion Corneal power measurements are a major source of error in IOL calculations. New corneal imaging technology and IOL calculation formulas have improved outcomes and hold the promise of ongoing progress. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,"Article; astigmatism; cataract extraction; cornea; cornea curvature; endothelial keratoplasty; human; keratoconus; keratometry; keratomileusis; lens implant; measurement error; ophthalmic camera; optical coherence tomography; photorefractive keratectomy; priority journal; refractive surgery; astigmatism; biometry; cornea; eye refraction; lens implant; optics; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; Astigmatism; Biometry; Cornea; Corneal Topography; Humans; Lenses, Intraocular; Optics and Photonics; Refraction, Ocular"

Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the major reason for the loss of vision in patients suffering from DR. Early identification of the DR enables to prevent the vision loss and encourage diabetic control activities. Many techniques are developed to diagnose the DR. The major drawbacks of the existing techniques are low accuracy and high time complexity. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes an enhanced particle swarm optimization-differential evolution feature selection (PSO-DEFS) based feature selection approach with biometric authentication for the identification of DR. Initially, a hybrid median filter (HMF) is used for pre-processing the input images. Then, the pre-processed images are embedded with each other by using least significant bit (LSB) for authentication purpose. Simultaneously, the image features are extracted using convoluted local tetra pattern (CLTrP) and Tamura features. Feature selection is performed using PSO-DEFS and PSO-gravitational search algorithm (PSO-GSA) to reduce time complexity. Based on some performance metrics, the PSO-DEFS is chosen as a better choice for feature selection. The feature selection is performed based on the fitness value. A multi-relevance vector machine (M-RVM) is introduced to classify the 13 normal and 62 abnormal images among 75 images from 60 patients. Finally, the DR patients are further classified by M-RVM. The experimental results exhibit that the proposed approach achieves better accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity than the existing techniques.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: This study included 103 PAC or PACG patients who had undergone cataract surgery. Methods: All participants underwent anterior-segment optical coherence tomography preoperatively. Two novel biometric factors – the relative lens vault (the ratio of lens vault to anterior vault) and the anterior vault (the sum of lens vault and anterior chamber depth) – were measured using customized software. The powers of the implanted intraocular lens and the actual postoperative refractive errors were compared. The mean refractive error and the median absolute error were calculated and compared using repeated measures ANOVA and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. The biometric factors associated with the postoperative refractive error were investigated by multivariate regression analysis. Main Outcome Measures: Preoperative anterior-segment biometric factors, difference between predicted and actual postoperative refraction. Results: The Haigis, Hoffer Q and SRK/T formulas all showed a slight tendency toward resultant hyperopia, respectively (P < 0.001, P = 0.05, P = 0.003). The Hoffer Q formula had the least prediction error (P < 0.001). In the multivariate regression analysis, the relative lens vault was the only independent factor predicting postoperative refractive error (β = 0.392, P = 0.011). Conclusion: Intraocular lens power predictions for cataract surgery in PAC or PACG patients can be inaccurate. Such results might be associated with anterior-segment biometric factors. Preoperative relative lens vault appears to be a significant factor predicting refractive outcome after cataract surgery in patients with PAC or PACG. © 2016 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists","cataract surgery; primary angle-closure glaucoma; refractive outcome; relative lens vault","aged; anterior eye segment; biometry; closed angle glaucoma; eye refraction; female; human; lens implant; lens implantation; male; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; optics; pathology; pathophysiology; phacoemulsification; physiology; pseudophakia; retrospective study; visual acuity; Aged; Anterior Eye Segment; Biometry; Female; Glaucoma, Angle-Closure; Humans; Lens Implantation, Intraocular; Lenses, Intraocular; Male; Middle Aged; Optics and Photonics; Phacoemulsification; Pseudophakia; Refraction, Ocular; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity"

The purpose of this study was to investigate functional outcomes in patients undergoing bilateral anatomic TSA to understand the ideal timing for the second arthroplasty. Methods Patients who underwent bilateral TSA for osteoarthritis between 2000 and 2012 with a minimum follow-up of 12 months since their most recent surgery were evaluated. Postoperative patient-reported outcomes (University of California–Los Angeles [UCLA] shoulder rating scale, Constant score, and Simple Shoulder Test [SST]), biometrics (strength and range of motion), and a subjective questionnaire were compared for 4 “interval groups” based on timing between surgeries: <6 months, 6 to 12 months, 12 to 24 months, and >24 months. Results Eighty-two shoulders (41 patients, 70 ± 9 years old) were analyzed. Mean postoperative UCLA, Constant, and SST scores were 29, 72, and 9 points, respectively; 83% of patients reported satisfaction with both shoulders. Patients with <6 months between surgeries demonstrated significantly better UCLA scores than 6- to 12-month interval patients (P = .04), greater Constant scores compared with all other groups (P < .001), and greater SST scores compared with 6- to 12-month and 12- to 24-month interval patients (P = .002), with no differences in length of follow-up between groups. Conclusion In the absence of extrinsic factors, such as convenience, changes in social support structure, or changes in health status, patients may be advised that having the second surgery within 6 months of the first might optimize their postoperative functional outcomes and satisfaction compared with waiting a longer interval between surgeries. © 2016 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees","Constant; interval; Simple Shoulder Test; spacing; timing; TSA; UCLA","antibiotic agent; abduction; adult; aged; antibiotic therapy; Article; biometry; bone strength; clinical article; cohort analysis; Constant score; device removal; female; follow up; human; joint function; joint mobility; male; musculoskeletal disease assessment; osteoarthritis; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; patient-reported outcome; postoperative complication; postoperative period; priority journal; prosthesis infection; range of motion; rating scale; shoulder disease; shoulder pain; shoulder prosthesis; Simple Shoulder Test; staged bilateral total shoulder arthroplasty; time to treatment; total shoulder arthroplasty; University of California Los Angeles Shoulder Rating Scale; middle aged; patient satisfaction; patient-reported outcome; retrospective study; shoulder; shoulder replacement; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Shoulder; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Patient Satisfaction; Retrospective Studies; Shoulder Joint; Time-to-Treatment"

In spite of its known susceptibility to errors in cases of underweight or overweight babies, important obstetric decisions depend on it. In the present contribution we have examined the accuracy and error distribution of 35 weight estimation formulae within the normal weight range of 2500-4000 g. The aim of the study was to identify the weight estimation formulae with the best possible correspondence to the requirements of clinical routine. Materials and Methods: 35 clinically established weight estimation formulae were analysed in 3416 foetuses with weights between 2500 and 4000 g. For this we determined and compared themean percentage error (MPE), themean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the proportions of estimates within the error ranges of 5, 10, 20 and 30%. In addition, separate regression lineswere calculated for the relationship between estimated and actual birth weights for the weight range 2500-4000 g. The formulae were thus examined for possible inhomogeneities. Results: The lowest MPE were achieved with the Hadlock III and V formulae (0.8%, STW 9.2% or, respectively, −0.8%, STW 10.0%). The lowest absolute error (6.6%) as well as the most favourable frequency distribution in cases below 5% and 10% error (43.9 and 77.5) were seen for the Halaska formula. In graphic representations of the regression lines, 16 formulae revealed a weight overestimation in the lower weight range and an underestimation in the upper range. 14 formulae gave underestimations and merely 5 gave overestimations over the entire tested weight range. Conclusion: The majority of the tested formulae gave underestimations of the actual birth weight over the entire weight range or at least in the upper weight range. This result supports the current strategy of a two-stageweight estimation in which a formula is first chosen after a pre-estimation of the weight range. © Georg Thieme Verlag KGStuttgart · New York.","biometry; foetal weight estimation; regression formula","biometry; birth weight; error; fetus; fetus weight; writing"

Whilst many investigations have focused on the static and dynamic indications of known or spurious behaviour in handwriting, little empirical research is available regarding the identification of such writings through the analysis and comparison of non-visible, intra-signature, kinematic parameters. These features are associated with segments within a signature formation where the pen is momentarily lifted from the page, such as might occur between a first and last name, or when the pen is lifted from the page for the purpose of crossing a ‘t’ or dotting an ‘i’. It is postulated that this type of feature analysis may be of value in support of examiners’ static examinations of disputed writings, and subsequent formation of opinion as to genuineness or otherwise. To investigate this, 13 skilled writers generated 195 known signature formations, which were then simulated 1560 times by eight simulators. All signatures, known and simulated, were simultaneously captured both statically and dynamically. The presence of non-visible features in the known signatures was recorded, analysed and compared with the prevalence of similar features in the simulation attempts. The duration, absolute size, straightness error and jerk (disfluency measure) of the extracted segments were examined and compared, with the result that simulated signatures showed an increase in all the above parameters, compared with the known signatures. Furthermore, the visualised representation of the non-visible, intra-signature segments illustrated an overall gross pictorial disparity between the known and simulated signatures, which may be of use during first pass authenticity examinations.

Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether the addition of maternal serum PlGF improved the performance of screening that was achieved by a combination of maternal factors, fetal biometry and UtA-PI. Results: Significant contribution to the prediction of stillbirth was provided by maternal factor-derived a-priori risk, multiples of the median values of PlGF, UtA-PI and fetal biometry Z-scores. A model combining these variables predicted 58% of all stillbirths and 84% of those due to impaired placentation, at a false-positive rate of 10%. Within the impaired-placentation group, the detection rate of stillbirth < 32 weeks' gestation was higher than that of stillbirth ≥ 37 weeks (97% vs 61%; P < 0.01). Conclusions: A high proportion of stillbirths due to impaired placentation can be identified effectively in the second trimester of pregnancy using a combination of maternal factors, fetal biometry, uterine artery Doppler and maternal serum PlGF.

Setting Ulucanlar Eye Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. Design Prospective comparative study. Methods Patients who had unilateral primary pterygium excision were included in the study group. Anterior segment photographed images were taken of eyes with pterygia to calculate the pterygium length and area using the ImageJ program. Preoperative and 3-month postoperative biometry measurements (Lenstar LS900) were obtained for eyes with pterygium and their healthy fellow eyes (control group). Results Thirty-two patients with pterygium (mean age 63.31 years ± 7.18 [SD]) were included. The mean pterygium length was 3.07 ± 0.81 mm, and the mean area was 6.26 ± 2.07 mm2. The preoperative intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation with all formulas were higher than postoperative and control values (P &lt; .001). The mean changes were 0.47 diopter (D) for the SRK II, 0.59 D for SRK/T, 0.47 D for Hoffer Q, 0.39 D for Haigis, and 0.38 D for Holladay 2 formulas after pterygium surgery. Positive, significant, and moderate correlations were found between the pterygium size and the change in IOL power. Pterygia longer than 2.40 mm and larger than 5.45 mm2 created at least equal to or more than 0.5 D deviation in the IOL power calculations. Conclusion If the pterygium size is larger than 2.40 mm or 5.45 mm2 and simultaneous surgery is planned, the implanted IOL power should be at least 0.50 D smaller than the calculated power.

We therefore aimed to investigate the short-term outcome of periviable SGA fetuses in relation to the likely underlying cause. Methods: This was a retrospective study of data from three London tertiary fetal medicine centers obtained between 2000 and 2015. We included viable singleton pregnancies with a severely small fetus, defined as those with an abdominal circumference ≤ 3rd percentile, identified between 22 + 0 and 25 + 6 weeks' gestation. Data obtained included fetal biometry, presence of placental anomalies, uterine and fetal Doppler and neonatal outcome. We excluded cases with structural abnormalities, proven or suspected abnormal karyotype or genetic syndromes. Cases were classified according to the suspected underlying cause of the small fetal size into one of the following categories: uteroplacental insufficiency, evidence of placental damage with normal uterine artery Doppler, viral infection, or unclassied. Results: There were 245 cases included in the study. Of these, at diagnosis of SGA, 201 (82%) were categorized as uteroplacental cause, 13 (5%) as suspected placental cause, one (0.4%) as suspected viral cause and 30 (12%) could not be assigned to any of these categories. Overall, 101 (41%) cases survived the neonatal period; 89 (36%) underwent in-utero fetal demise, 22 (9%) died neonatally and 33 (14%) pregnancies were terminated. The diagnosis-to-delivery interval was 8.1 weeks in those that survived and 4.5 weeks in those that died neonatally. Conclusions: Almost 90% of periviable SGA cases are associated with uteroplacental insufficiency or intraplacental damage. Survival is related to gestational age at delivery, with outcomes better than might be assumed at diagnosis and some pregnancies reaching term. Copyright © 2016 ISUOG.

Materials and Methods We retrospectively identified pregnancies diagnosed with fetal cataract during antenatal ultrasound. Evaluation of fetal eyes included intraocular anatomy and biometry. Data on fetal malformations, serology and fetal karyotype were collected. Results 8 cases, identified over the course of 10 years, were reviewed. Week 15 was the mean time for diagnosis (range 11 – 34). Extraocular anomalies were demonstrated in 6 cases (central nervous system, cardiac and renal systems). Additional intraocular abnormalities were detected in two cases: one fetus had persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous and another had bilateral retinal detachment. All cases but one involved cataracts in both eyes. The unilateral case was associated with microphthalmic aphakia. All cases had negative serology for TORCHs. 7 out of the 8 fetuses were terminated. The only one who survived developed in utero cataracts secondary to maternal steroid therapy. He underwent bilateral cataract extraction during the first weeks of life and ophthalmologic evaluation at 2 years of age was unremarkable, without any visual impairment. Conclusion In most cases, fetal cataract was associated with additional abnormalities, both intra- and extra-ocular.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the reuse of treated wastewater (TWW) from CW for irrigation of Bermudagrass turf (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.) and assess the effects of TWW on the biometric and qualitative parameters of the turfgrass and on chemical–physical soil properties. The research was carried out in Sicily (Italy) in a pilot-scale horizontal subsurface flow system which was fed with urban TWW following secondary treatment from an activate sludge wastewater treatment plant. The pilot-system included three separate parallel units. The outflow TWW flowed downhill into three storage tanks which were connected to sprinkler systems. Bermudagrass plots were irrigated with freshwater (FW) and with TWW from planted units and unplanted unit. The TWW quality did not affect the visual turf quality and colour. The above-ground biomass yield of Bermudagrass was on average 1.31Â kgÂ m−2 in the TWW-irrigated plots. There was not a significant variation of soil pH, but an increase in organic matter content and salinity were recorded in TWW-irrigated plots. The results confirm that TWW provides an additional water source and fertilisers where the supply of FW is limited. Â© 2016 Balaban Desalination Publications.

In this paper, we investigate the invariability of features that are extracted based on the spatial distribution of the spectral power of EEG data corresponding to 2-second eyes-closed resting-state (ECRS) recording, in different scenarios. Eyes-closed resting-state EEG signals in 4 healthy adults are recorded in two different sessions with an interval of at least one week between sessions. The performance in terms of correct recognition rate (CRR) is examined when the training and testing datasets are chosen from the same recording session, and when the training and testing datasets are chosen from different sessions. It is shown that an CRR of 92% can be achieved based on the proposed features when the training and testing datasets are taken from different sessions. To reduce the number of recording channels, principal component analysis (PCA) is also employed to identify channels that carry the most discriminatory information across individuals. High CRR is obtained based on the data from channels mostly covering the occipital region. The results suggest that features based on the spatial distribution of the spectral power of the short-time (e.g. 2 seconds) ECRS recordings can have great potentials in EEG-based biometric identification systems. © 2016 IEEE.",,"adult; biometry; electroencephalography; human; principal component analysis; procedures; signal processing; Adult; Biometric Identification; Electroencephalography; Humans; Principal Component Analysis; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"

Methods: Twenty-two neophyte subjects wore soft contact lenses for a period of five hours. Topography based corneo-scleral limbal radius estimates were derived from height measurements acquired with a corneo-scleral profilometer. Additionally, central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), corneal curvature radius (R) and white-to-white (WTW) diameter were acquired with an OCT-assisted biometer. Measurements were obtained without lens wear (baseline), immediately after lens removal following five hours of wear and three hours after lens removal. Results: Short-term soft contact lens wear significantly modifies corneo-scleral limbal radius (mean. ±. SD: 130. ±. 74. μm, p << 0.001) and the changes are repeatable. In contrast, the WTW diameter and R were not modified. ACD and CCT were significantly affected but no significant correlations were found between the increment of the limbal radius and the decrease in ACD and CCT. Limbal radius increment was reversed three hours after lens removal for 68% of the subjects but the time course of this reversal was not uniform. Conclusions: It is possible to accurately quantify limbal radius changes as a consequence of soft contact lens wear. The increment in the limbal diameter could reach over 0.5. mm but that alteration does not correspond to changes in WTW diameter and it was not observable to the examiner using a slit lamp. Assessing topographical limbus after contact lens wear could be a tool to optimize the selection of the contact lens, from the perspective of anterior eye surface changes. © 2017 British Contact Lens Association.","Anterior eye surface; Anterior segment; Biometry; Daily soft contact lenses; Limbus",

The aim of this study was to establish formulae for estimation of the axial radius of curvature (ARC) of the anterior sclera using ocular biometric parameters that can be easily obtained with conventional devices.METHODS: A semi-automated stitching method and a computational analysis tool for calculating ARC were developed by using the ImageJ and MATLAB software. The ARC of all the ocular surface points were analyzed from the composite horizontal cross-sectional images of the right eyes of 24 volunteers; these measurements were obtained using anterior segment optical coherence tomography for a previous study (AS-OCT; Visante). Ocular biometric parameters were obtained from the same volunteers with slit-scanning topography and partial coherence interferometry. Correlation analysis was performed between the ARC at 8 mm to the axis line (ARC[8]) and other ocular parameters (including age). With ARC obtained on several nasal and temporal points (7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, and 9.0 mm from the axis line), univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to develop a model for estimating ARC with the help of ocular biometric parameters.RESULTS: Axial length, spherical equivalent, and angle kappa showed correlations with temporal ARC[8] (tARC[8]; Pearson's r = 0.653, -0.579, and -0.341; P = 0.001, 0.015, and 0.015, respectively). White-to-white corneal diameter (WTW) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) showed correlation with nasal ARC[8] (nARC[8]; Pearson's r = -0.492 and -0.461; P = 0.015 and 0.023, respectively).

Angle kappa showed strong correlation with axial length (Pearson's r = -0.813, P <0.001), and the different correlation patterns of nasal and temporal ARC with axial length can be explained by the ocular surface deviation represented by angle kappa.CONCLUSIONS: Axial length, ACD, and WTW are useful parameters for estimating the ARC of the anterior sclera, which is important for the haptic design of scleral contact lenses.

Methods Three consecutive measurements with the 2 devices were performed by the same examiner in 65 eyes of 65 patients with cataract. Patients were divided into 2 groups: axial length (AL) between 22 and 26 mm (Group 1) and more than 26 mm (Group 2). Comparisons were performed for AL, anterior chamber depth (ACD), keratometry (K, over 2.4 mm diameter for AL-Scan and 2.3 mm diameter for Lenstar) and corneal diameter (CD). Repeatability was analyzed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the agreement was by the Bland-Altman method. Results The repeatability of both devices was high for all biometry measurements (ICC over 0.970) in Group 1 and 2. The best repeatability was achieved for AL in each group. In both groups, the differences were statistically significant for all parameters (p < 0.05) except for the measurement of AL and CCT (p > 0.05). The Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between devices for all measurements in both groups. The closest agreement was for the AL measurements (ranged from −0.06 to 0.08 mm in Group 1 and −0.05–0.07 mm in Group 2).

This retrospective comparative study included 485 eyes that underwent uneventful phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Applanation A-scan ultrasound biometry and postoperative manifest refraction were obtained in all eyes. Biometric data were entered into each of the five IOL power calculation formulas: SRK-II, SRK/T, Holladay I, Hoffer Q, and Binkhorst II. All eyes were divided into three groups according to axial length: short (≤22.0 mm), average (22.0–25.0 mm), and long (≥25.0 mm) eyes. The postoperative spherical equivalent was calculated and compared with the predicted refractive error using each biometric formula. The results showed that all formulas had significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE) in comparison with Binkhorst II formula (P < 0.01). The lowest MAE was obtained with the SRK-II for average (0.49 ± 0.40 D) and short (0.67 ± 0.54 D) eyes and the SRK/T for long (0.61 ± 0.50 D) eyes. The highest postoperative hyperopic shift was seen with the SRK-II for average (46.8 %), short (28.1 %), and long (48.4 %) eyes. The highest postoperative myopic shift was seen with the Holladay I for average (66.4 %) and long (71.0 %) eyes and the SRK/T for short eyes (80.6 %). In conclusion, the SRK-II formula produced the lowest MAE in average and short eyes and the SRK/T formula produced the lowest MAE in long eyes. The SRK-II has the highest postoperative hyperopic shift in all eyes.

Methods: Three-dimensional transperineal ultrasound was performed in nulliparous Chinese women with a singleton pregnancy at 9–12 weeks, 26–28 weeks and 36–38 weeks of gestation and again at 12 months after delivery. Hiatal anteroposterior (AP) diameter, transverse diameter and area were measured on the antenatal ultrasound volumes obtained at rest, on Valsalva maneuver and during pelvic floor muscle contraction (PFMC). LAM injury was evaluated using ultrasound volumes obtained during PFMC at 12 months after delivery. Results: In total, 328 women completed the study. At 12 months after delivery, 38 (14.8% of those who delivered vaginally) women had LAM injury; 28 were unilateral (14 right- and 14 left-sided) and 10 were bilateral. In all three trimesters there was smaller hiatal AP diameter and hiatal area in women with LAM injury when compared with women without injury. On multivariable analysis of the three factors, hiatal AP diameter at rest, hiatal area at rest and operative vaginal delivery, only hiatal AP diameter at rest in all three trimesters was an independent factor of LAM injury. A larger hiatal AP diameter at rest in the first, second and third trimesters reduced the likelihood of LAM injury with odds ratios of 0.21, 0.15 and 0.21, respectively. Conclusions: A smaller antenatal hiatal AP diameter at rest is a risk factor for LAM injury. The hiatal AP diameter is relatively simple to measure and the error in measurement is relatively small. A prospective study to confirm this relationship and to explore whether this measurement, performed in the midsagittal plane, is repeatable should be performed. Copyright © 2015 ISUOG.

Jiangning eye study is a randomized, population based study in Shanghai to determine whether myopia has an effect on the prevalence of occludable angles. Methods A total of 2478 residents aged 50 years and over were randomly selected, and 2044 (82.5%) individuals of them participated in ophthalmic examinations between November 2012 and February 2013. Eye examinations included autorefraction, noncontact tonometry, measurement of axial length, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Results The crude prevalences of iris trabecular meshwork contact in Jiangning Chinese individuals with myopia, emmetropia, and hyperopia are 1.25%, 6.44%, and 7.43%, respectively. There is also iris trabecular meshwork contact and shallow anterior chamber depth in myopia subjects even with long axial lengths. Conclusions The prevalence of iris trabecular meshwork contact in myopia subjects is lower than their emmetropia or hyperopia counterparts. Axial length is an important factor associate with occludable angle. © 2016 Liu et al.

Analyses of colony length, ratio of peduncle to colony length, weight/length ratio, polyp size and density as well as sclerite shape, location and abundance indicate that their phenotype is modulated by environmental factors (e.g. food availability, currents and sediment type) and antipredator strategies. Moreover, the three species had different carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures that could be explain primarily by their different polyp diameters and colony shapes, suggesting that they rely on slightly different food sources (varying proportions of phytodetritus and zooplankton). Finally, sclerites were found only in H. finmarchica and P. aculeata and are not known to occur in A. grandiflorum, except for minute oval bodies inside the peduncle. The Mg/Ca ratio of sclerites differed between the two species and, for P. aculeata, among types of sclerites, evoking different biomineralization pathways related to their functional roles (structural support or defence). Overall, this study provides new information on the ecology of poorly known species, which are ubiquitous and suspected to play an important ecological role in deep-water ecosystems. © 2015 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences","adaptation; deep sea; morphology; sea pens; trophic level","Aculeata; Anthoptilum grandiflorum; Anthozoa; Pennatula aculeata; Pennatulacea"

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 6,126 fetal biometrical measurements performed within 3 days of delivery. SGA prediction was evaluated for various sEFW formulas by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value (PPV/NPV), likelihood ratio (+LR/-LR), overall accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Systematic error, random error, proportion of estimates >10% of birth weights, actual and absolute weight differences were compared between SGA and non-SGA neonates. Results: Overall, 638 (10.4%) neonates were SGA. There was considerable variation among formulas in sensitivity (mean ± SD, 62 ± 14.4%; range, 32.4-91.2), PPV (72.5 ± 10.7%; 45.8-95.6) and +LR (24.2 ± 10.9; 7.2-57.3), mild variation in specificity (96.6 ± 2.7%; 87.4-99.4), NPV (94.6 ± 5.3%; 72.2-98.9) and -LR (0.4 ± 0.1; 0.1-0.7) and minimal variation in AUC (mean, 0.93; range, 0.91-0.93). The majority of formulas had a lower accuracy for the SGA neonates, with systematic error and random error ranging from -4.2 to 14.3% and from 8.4 to 12.9% for SGA, and from -8.7 to 16.1% and from 7.2 to 10.5% for non-SGA, respectively. Conclusion: sEFW formulas differ in their accuracy for SGA prediction. In our population, the most accurate formula for SGA prediction was Hadlock's formula utilizing femur length, abdominal and head circumference. © 2016 S.

METHODS: Axial length, corneal power, and anterior chamber depth (corneal epithelium to lens) were measured in 86 eyes of 86 patients scheduled for cataract surgery using both biometers. All values were analyzed using a paired t test, the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient (r), and Bland - Altman plots. RESULTS: The mean axial length values of both instruments were exactly the same (23.46 ± 0.99 mm) for both) and showed excellent agreement and correlation. On the contrary, the AL-Scan measured a steeper mean corneal power by 0.08 diopters (D) at the 2.4-mm zone but by only 0.03 D at the 3.3-mm zone, only the former being statistically significant. The AL-Scan measured a deeper anterior chamber depth by 0.13 mm, which was statistically significant (P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Agreement between the two units was good. However, the small but statistically significant difference in corneal power (at the IOLMaster-comparable 2.4-mm zone) and in the anterior chamber depth measurement make lens constant optimization necessary when calculating the intraocular lens power by means of theoretical formulas. © Copyright SLACK Incorporated.",,"adult; aged; al scan; anterior eye chamber depth; Article; cataract; cataract extraction; controlled study; corneal power; correlation coefficient; device comparison; eye axis length; female; human; iolmaster 500; major clinical study; male; observational study; partial coherence interferometry biometer; priority journal; prospective study; visual system parameters; anatomy and histology; anterior eye chamber; biometry; comparative study; cornea; devices; interferometry; light; middle aged; physiology; reproducibility; validation study; very elderly; visual acuity; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anterior Chamber; Axial Length, Eye; Biometry; Cataract Extraction; Cornea; Female; Humans; Interferometry; Light; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Visual Acuity"

Nineteen buffaloes, with initial ages between 11 and 59 months, were submitted to fortnightly collections of semen for a period of six months. At each collection the testicular biometry and testicular echogenicity were evaluated as well as blood samples were also collected to measure the plasma testosterone levels. The data were submitted to analysis of variance by the GLM procedure, considering the age group fixed effect. The average data obtained were compared by the Duncan test, at 5% significance. There was a significant growth (P&lt;0.05) of the scrotal circumference, which varied from 12.88±0.51 cmto 31.18±0.75 cm among animals aged 12 to 60 months, as well as testicular volume, which ranged from 30.28±17.37 to 611.96±38.69 cm3 among the animals. The echogenic intensity of the testicular parenchyma varied in pixels from 78.67±6.36 to 109.24±3.13 in animals aged 12 to 60 months respectively. In the animals with ages between 12 and 19 months was observed levels of testosterone considered being low, whereas in the animals from 20 to 21 months there was a progressive increase in the testosterone levels, which showed their peak in the animals older than 60 months. Therefore, through ultrasonography it was possible to detect differences in echogenicity among different phases of pre-puberty, puberty and sexual maturity in the animals, and this procedure seems to be an important tool in the selection of this characteristic.","Amazon; Bubalus bubalis; Buffalo; Testicular biometry; Ultrasonography",

Although retinal dopamine (DA) has been long implicated in myopia development, current studies demonstrate that retinal DA levels are unaltered in C57BL/6 mice with formdeprivation myopia. This work was undertaken to explore whether and how refractive development is perturbed in this mouse strain when retinal DA levels are reduced by 6- hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) administration. METHODS. On two successive days, 6-OHDA was injected into the vitreous of P18 mice. Retinal DA levels were measured by HPLC and TH levels analyzed by quantitative Western blotting. To choose appropriate 6-OHDA doses that significantly reduce retinal DA levels, but cause minimal disturbance of overall retinal physiology, ERG analysis was performed. Refractive errors were measured using a photorefractor, and ocular biometry performed with optical coherence tomography and photokeratometry. RESULTS. Administration of 6-OHDA of 6.25 μg and 12.5 μg significantly reduced retinal levels of DA and TH, but without affecting ERG a- and b-wave amplitudes. With normal visual experience, 6-OHDA induced myopic refractive shifts in a dose-dependent fashion. Form deprivation induced further myopic shifts in 6-OHDA–injected eyes, but did not cause further decline in retinal DA. Furthermore, 6-OHDA administration resulted in a shorter axial length and a steeper cornea, whereas form deprivation led to a longer axial length, without changing the corneal radius of curvature. CONCLUSIONS. Reducing retinal DA levels led to myopic refractive shifts in C57BL/6 mice, which mainly resulted from a steeper cornea. In addition to the DA-independent mechanism for form-deprivation myopia, there is a DA-dependent mechanism in parallel that underlies myopic refractive shifts under normal laboratory conditions in this mouse strain. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

The variation size is already known, but it is necessary to know how this is for morphological variables. This study aimed to identify the relationships between testate amoebae morphology and environmental factors in four neotropical floodplains. We conducted detailed morphometric analyses on 27 common species of planktonic testate amoebae from genera Arcella, Centropyxis, Cucurbitella, Suiadifflugia, Difflugia, Lesquereusia and Netzelia. We sampled subsurface water from each lake in 72 lakes in four Brazilian floodplain lakes. Our goals were to assess: (1) the range of their morphological variability (a) over space within each floodplain, and (b) among the four floodplains, and (c) over time, and (2) which environmental factors explained this variation. Mean shell height and breadth varied considerably among the different floodplain lakes, especially in the Pantanal and Amazonian floodplains. The morphological variability of testate amoeba was correlated to environmental conditions (ammonia, nitrate, phosphate, chlorophyll-a, turbidity, temperature, and depth). Thus, understanding the morphological variation of the testate amoeba species can elucidate many questions involving the ecology of these organisms. Furthermore, could help molecular studies, bioindicator role of these organisations, environmental reconstruction, among others. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH","Arcellinida; Biometry; Morphometry; Plankton; Protists; Taxonomy","amoeba (life cycle stage); Brazil; cytology; environment; lake; parasitology; tropic climate; Amoeba; Brazil; Environment; Lakes; Tropical Climate"

Wistar male rats, 21 days old, were allocated into the following: control (n = 17, received corn oil), MeHg (n = 17, received MeHg at 0.5 mg/kg/day), Aroclor (n = 17, received Aroclor at 1.0 mg/kg/day), low mix (n = 18, received MeHg at 0.05 mg/kg/day and Aroclor at 0.1 mg/kg/day), high mix (n = 18, received MeHg at 0.5 mg/kg/day and Aroclor at 1.0 mg/kg/day). Dosing continued from post natal day (PND) 23 to 53, by gavage. Euthanasia was performed on PND 53; or, after an interval of 62 days without exposure to chemicals, on PND 115. The degree of maturation of the seminiferous epithelium was delayed in chemical-exposed groups and testicular interstitial oedema was observed at adulthood. The pattern of male gonad organization was changed in the Aroclor group on PND 53 and in all treated groups at adulthood. The animals from Aroclor, low mix and high mix groups showed a reduction in the number of Sertoli cells. Histological evidence of renal injury was observed in all chemical-exposed groups in both ages. A probable target for MeHg and Aroclor in the reproductive system was Sertoli cells, in which possible dysfunctions could be linked to the other testicular alterations. Curiously, the main deleterious effects were late outcomes, along with the absence of synergistic interaction of MeHg and Aroclor in the parameters investigated. In conclusion, fish pollutants MeHg and Aroclor caused permanent structural damage in male gonads and kidneys after prepubertal exposure, without showing clear chemical interactions. © 2016 The Authors.

Histological and biometric observations on specimens with shell lengths (SLs) of 0.5–4.2 mm revealed three cohorts in this dioecious population. The first cohort was dominated by mature females, each with an estimated fecundity of ~450 oocytes with a mean diameter of 28.0 ± 3.9 µm (maximum diameter 40.0 µm); an intermediate cohort was a mix of males and females with SL at first maturity of ≤1.7 mm; the third cohort was exclusively morphologically distinct, mature, dwarf males, SL ~500 µm. These dwarf males were attached to the dorsal shell surfaces of females in the first cohort. The difference in the SL of Prodissoconch I (~60 µm) and Prodissoconch II (500–530 µm) confirmed planktotrophy. Based on their carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios, and a paedomorphic morphology suggesting they are ill-equipped to bore wood, it seems likely that the dwarf males are heterotrophic filter-feeders. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed, however, that dwarf males hosted a few Gammaproteobacteria in their gills. The absence of a bacterial signal in the germ cells and developing oocytes of females implies that direct trans-ovarial inheritance of symbiotic bacteria does not occur in X. atlantica. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"bacterium; biometry; bivalve; carbon isotope; colonization; coniferous tree; fecundity; filter feeder; histology; hybridization; hydrothermal vent; nitrogen isotope; phenotypic plasticity; stable isotope; wood; Atlantic Ocean; Mid-Atlantic Ridge; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bivalvia; Gammaproteobacteria; Xylophaga atlantica"

Methods: Two thousand samples of corneal parameters with keratometric astigmatism ≥ 1.0 D were obtained using bootstrap methods. The probability distributions for incision-induced keratometric and posterior corneal astigmatisms, as well as ELP were estimated from the literature review. The predicted residual astigmatism error using method D with an IOL add power calculator (IAPC) was compared with those derived using methods A, B, and C through Monte-Carlo simulation. Method A considered the keratometric astigmatism and incision-induced keratometric astigmatism, method B considered posterior corneal astigmatism in addition to the A method, method C considered incision-induced posterior corneal astigmatism in addition to the B method, and method D considered ELP in addition to the C method. To verify the IAPC used in this study, the predicted toric IOL cylinder power and its axis using the IAPC were compared with ray-tracing simulation results. Results: The median magnitude of the predicted residual astigmatism error using method D (0.25 diopters [D]) was smaller than that derived using methods A (0.42 D), B (0.38 D), and C (0.28 D) respectively. Linear regression analysis indicated that the predicted toric IOL cylinder power and its axis had excellent goodness-of-fit between the IAPC and ray-tracing simulation.

To compare ocular biometric and anterior segment parameters between the affected and fellow eye in subjects with acute primary angle closure (APAC). METHODS. We evaluated 76 subjects with unilateral APAC who had undergone bilateral laser peripheral iridotomy before enrollment. Imaging was done using anterior segment optical coherence tomography and a customized software was used to measure the following: angle opening distance (AOD750); trabecular–iris space area (TISA750); iris thickness (IT750); iris curvature (ICURV); iris area (IAREA); anterior chamber depth; area and volume (ACD; ACA and ACV); anterior chamber width (ACW); anterior vault (ACD+LV); lens vault (LV); and pupil diameter (PD). We used A-scan ultrasonography to measure axial length (AL) and lens thickness (LT). Mean differences in ocular biometric and anterior segment parameters were assessed using linear mixed model adjusting for PD. RESULTS. A total of 53 subjects (36 females, 67.9%) with a mean age of 62.7 ± 8.1 years were analyzed after excluding 17 unanalyzable images in at least one eye. Affected eyes had shallower ACD, smaller ACA, ACV, anterior vault, TISA750, AOD750, and ICURV (all P < 0.05). Axial length, ACW, LV, LT, IAREA, and IT750 did not differ between the eyes. In the affected eyes, IT750 was significantly associated AOD750 (P < 0.05); whereas in the fellow eyes, IT750 and AL was predictive of AOD750 (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. Eyes with previous APAC had smaller anterior segment dimensions when compared with their fellow eyes. Iris thickness was the strongest predictor of angle width in both affected and fellow eyes. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

Methods: All patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination, including best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, applanation tonometry, axial length measurements with a swept-source biometer (IOLMaster 700, Carl Zeiss Medic AG, Jena, Germany) and macular 30° linear EDI- B-scan SD-OCT section (Spectralis HRAII+OCT, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) in both eyes. Analysis of choroidal thickness was performed at three different locations: subfoveally, 750 μm nasally, and 750 μm temporally to the fovea. Patients having received any surgery or intravitreal injections in the last 12 months and with axial length variance ≥ 1 mm between both eyes were excluded. Results: Sixteen eyes of eight consecutive patients with unilateral FUS were included. Segmented analysis of the choroid, separately considering Haller’s layer and Sattler’s–choriocapillaris layers, showed statistically significant lower values (p < 0.05) in affected eyes (FEs) compared to fellow eyes (NFEs). In NFEs, total choroidal thickness mean values ranged from 305.62 ± 92.96 μm to 347.50 ± 91.55 μm; in FEs those values were significantly lower (p < 0.05), ranging from 232.62 ± 89.33 μm to 255.62 ± 89.33 μm. Conclusion: Diffuse and full-thickness choroidal thinning in FEs was observed. Considering the absence of significant axial length differences between FEs and NFEs in our patient series, these data seem to suggest that the full-thickness choroidal thinning in FEs may be due to the inflammatory process. In that way, FUS might be regarded as an inflammatory condition involving the whole uveal tunic, even the posterior part of it, definitively supplanting the early definition of “heterochromic iridociclytis”. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Choroid; Choroidal thickness; Enhanced depth imaging; Fuchs Uveitis Syndrome; Optical coherence tomography","adult; Article; B scan; best corrected visual acuity; cataract; choroid capillary layer; choroid disease; choroidal thickness; clinical article; clinical feature; cohort analysis; comparative study; enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography; eye axis length; eye examination; female; fuchs uveitis syndrome; human; intraocular hypertension; iris atrophy; male; middle aged; priority journal; prospective study; quantitative analysis; retina fovea; slit lamp; SPECT scanner; spectral domain optical coherence tomography; tonometry; uveitis; vitreous disease; biometry; choroid; Choroid Diseases; diagnostic imaging; iridocyclitis; oculoplethysmography; optical coherence tomography; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; uveitis; vascularization; visual acuity; Adult; Biometry; Choroid; Choroid Diseases; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Iridocyclitis; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Slit Lamp; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Tonometry, Ocular; Uveitis; Visual Acuity"

Some plant species have adapted to fire prone environments by evolving protective structures. Acrocomia aculeata (macaw palm) is widely distributed throughout tropical America, and is found in environments continuously influenced by anthropogenic fire. We aimed to determine whether the fruit characteristics of A. aculeata enable seeds to resist the effects of fire and also the consequent effects of fire on fruit biometric traits and embryo viability. After a fire event in a region of pastureforest transition, we marked 30 individuals of A. aculeata. The trees were separated by UPGMA analysis into 5 groups according to fire exposure, ranging from trees with no exposure to trees with fruit completely exposed to fire. Fruit exposure to high temperatures led to lower values in fruit fresh weight, length, density, and processable mass.Fire had no significant effect on seed biometric variables, because of the structures of the fruit, including its lignified endocarp and its insulating and mucilaginous mesocarp. These structures helped to maintain the embryos viability by preventing oxidative damage. In conclusion, the fruit structure of the macaw palm may facilitate seed persistence, even when subject to increasingly frequent fire events. © 2016, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

Aims: The aim of this study is to perform a detailed investigation of clinical, immunohistochemical, and morphometric characteristics of desmoplastic (D) and nondesmoplastic (ND) ILC. Materials and Methods: This study included twenty cases of ILC that were divided into two groups designated as D and ND groups. Medical histories and diagnosis data were obtained from the archives of the Center of Pathology, Clinical center Niš (Serbia). Morphometric analysis of hematoxylin and eosin stained slides was performed using ImageJ software, and the obtained data were further statistical processed. Results: Statistical analyses of the data revealed that no significant differences between D and ND groups when patient age, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR) expressions and morphometrical parameters (such as the distance between groups of cancer cells and nucleocytoplasmic ratio) were compared. However, D and ND groups statistically, significantly differed in the occurrence of axillary lymph node metastasis, and when the ER and PR data were included, in certain nuclear parameters (cell/nucleus area, perimeter, Feret's diameter, and circularity). Conclusions: Desmoplastic stroma was observed more frequently in patients without axillary lymph node metastases, whereas the expression of ER and PR had no influence on its development.

Objective refraction was measured using an autorefractometer at approximately 3 months postoperatively, and the mean arithmetic PE and median absolute PE were compared among age groups. Results The mean preoperative refractive error predicted by the SRK/T formula was similar among age groups (P = .4179). The mean postoperative spherical equivalent was significantly more myopic in younger patients (P < .0001). Mean PE was −0.24 diopters (D) in those ≤59 years of age, −0.17 D in those 60–69 years of age, −0.11 D in those 70–79 years of age, and −0.05 D in those 80–89 years of age; the mean PE was less myopic in older patients (P = .0008). The median absolute PE did not differ significantly among groups (P = .6192). Mean PE was positively correlated with age (P < .0001).

Conclusion PE was less myopic by approximately 0.06 D per decade as age increased, suggesting that patient age should be considered when selecting IOL power. © 2016 The Authors",,"adult; age; aged; arithmetic; Article; astigmatism; cataract extraction; cohort analysis; controlled study; cornea curvature; female; human; lens implant; major clinical study; male; mathematical analysis; middle aged; phacoemulsification; prediction; prediction error; priority journal; prospective study; refraction error; treatment outcome; aging; biometry; diagnostic error; eye refraction; lens implantation; myopia; optics; phacoemulsification; physiology; procedures; very elderly; visual acuity; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Biometry; Cohort Studies; Diagnostic Errors; Female; Humans; Lens Implantation, Intraocular; Lenses, Intraocular; Male; Middle Aged; Myopia; Optics and Photonics; Phacoemulsification; Prospective Studies; Refraction, Ocular; Visual Acuity"

Methods: This observational cross sectional institutional study included patients with primary open angle glaucoma suspects (n = 21) and primary angle closure disease (primary angle closure, PAC, n = 63 and primary angle course glaucoma, PACG, n = 58 (defined by International society of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology, ISGEO). Two independent examiners blinded to clinical details, graded good quality pre-laser goniophotographs of the patients incorporating quadrants of peripheral anterior synechieae (PAS), non-visibility of posterior trabecular meshwork (PTM) and blotchy pigments (ranging from 1-4 quadrants), iris configuration, angle recess (sum of above depicting ACSSg) and lens thickness/axial length ratio (LT/AL), cup disc ratio and baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) to give total score (ACSSt). Result: There were significant differences in ACSSg scores within the same ISGEO stage of PAC and PACG between eyes that required nil or &gt;1medicines after laser iridotomy, p&lt;0.001. The ACSSg was associated with need for &gt;1 medicines in both PAC and PACG eyes, p&lt;0.001. An ACSSg score&gt;12 and 14 in PAC (odds ratio = 2.7(95% CI-1.7-5.9) and PACG (Odds ratio = 1.6(95%CI-1.19-2.2) predicted need for single medicines while ACSSg scores &gt;14 and 19 predicted need for ≥2 medicines in PAC and PACG eyes, respectively. The LT/Al ratio, IOP score or cup disc score did not influence the need for medical treatment independently. Conclusion: The ACSS can be a useful clinical adjunct to the ISGEO system to predict need for medicines and prognosticate each stage more accurately. Copyright © 2016 Rao et al.

However, d bears no relevance for nonspherical NPs. In the present study, the mean surface area to volume ratio, applicable to both spherical and nonspherical NPs, was used to replace d given the aim of obtaining the best dose metric (volume, surface area, or number) of differently shaped metallic NPs in vivo (9 organisms) and in vitro (6 mammalian cell lines). The slope of the curves obtained by relating the total particle number of NPs at various effect concentrations to the mean surface area to volume ratio was subsequently used to deduce the best dose metric. For the majority of the organisms studied, it was found that NP volume is the most appropriate dose metric, independent of the composition of the NPs tested. For 3 organisms exposed to Ag NPs, however, surface area was found to be the best dose metric. It is therefore concluded that the optimum dose metric depends on organism and NP properties.

This retrospective case series included eyes of patients who underwent implantation of a microincision IOL following 1.8 mm manual coaxial microincision cataract surgery and who attended regular postoperative follow-up visits on the first week and first, third, and sixth months. The postoperative uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refraction and predictability, intraoperative and postoperative complications, posterior capsule opacification (PCO), IOL centration, and surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) were evaluated. Sixty-three eyes of 38 patients ranging in age from 51 to 86 were included in the study. The mean preoperative BCVA was 0.52 ± 0.42 logMAR. At the postoperative sixth month, the mean postoperative UCVA and BCVA were 0.12 ± 0.11 and 0.01 ± 0.03 logMAR, respectively. The mean postoperative spherical equivalent refraction (SER) was −0.30 ± 0.49 D. The SER was within ± 1.00 D of the attempted correction in 95.2 % of the eyes. The mean SIA measured with vector analysis was 0.45 ± 0.28 D. Mild PCO was observed in 9 eyes (14.7 %) with none requiring Nd:Yag laser capsulotomy. On centration analysis, the IOL was found to be 0.26 mm on average to the supero-nasal position. The aspheric microincision IOL was safely implanted and provided satisfactory visual and refractive outcomes in the early postoperative period. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Microincision cataract surgery; Microincision intraocular lens; Posterior capsule opacification; Surgically induced astigmatism","aged; biometry; evaluation study; eye refraction; female; human; lens implant; lens implantation; male; microsurgery; middle aged; pathophysiology; peroperative complication; phacoemulsification; physiology; postoperative complication; prosthesis design; pseudophakia; retrospective study; very elderly; visual acuity; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biometry; Female; Humans; Intraoperative Complications; Lens Implantation, Intraocular; Lenses, Intraocular; Male; Microsurgery; Middle Aged; Phacoemulsification; Postoperative Complications; Prosthesis Design; Pseudophakia; Refraction, Ocular; Retrospective Studies; Visual Acuity"

Design: Retrospective clinical study. Methods: A total of 78 eyes from 41 patients who underwent ICL implantation surgery were included in this study. Preoperative biometric parameters, including white-to-white (WTW) diameter, central corneal thickness, keratometer, pupil diameter, anterior chamber depth, sulcus-to-sulcus diameter, anterior chamber area (ACA) and central curvature radius of the anterior surface of the lens (Lenscur), were measured. Lenscur and ACA were measured with Rhinoceros 5.0 software on the image scanned with ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). The vault was assessed by UBM 3 months after surgery. Multiple stepwise regression analysis was employed to identify the variables that were correlated with the vault. Results: The results showed that the vault was correlated with 3 variables: ACA (22.4 ± 4.25 mm2), WTW (11.36 ± 0.29 mm) and Lenscur (9.15 ± 1.21 mm). The regressive equation was: vault (mm) = 1.785 + 0.017 × ACA + 0.051 × Lenscur-0.203 × WTW. Conclusions: Biometric parameters of the anterior segment (ACA, WTW and Lenscur) can predict the vault after ICL implantation using a new regression equation. © 2016 S.

The mango rosa fruit is a very popular local variety (landrace), especially because of their superior technological characteristics such as high contents of Vitamin C and soluble solids (SS), as well as attractive taste and color. The objective of this study was to select a breeding population of mango rosa (polyclonal variety; ≥5 individuals) that can simultaneously meet the fresh and processed fruit markets, using the multivariate method of principal components and the biplot graphic. The principal components, biplot graphic, and phenotype correlations were obtained using the R (2012) software. Pulp percentage and the pulp, skin, and seed mass variables can be indirectly selected using the smallest fruit diameter, which allowed an easier measurement. The P23R AREA3, P30R AREA3, and P32R AREA3 genotypes are selection candidates due to the presence of alleles, which are important agro-technological traits for mango breeding. This study showed that the biplot analysis is a valuable tool for decision making and visualization of interrelationships between variables and genotypes, facilitating the mango selection process. © 2016 Ciencia Rural.

The rats were randomly divided into a control group (C-group) and three major experimental groups, which were further subdivided into minor groups (n = 6) according to the experimental period (7 or 56 days). The C-group was subdivided into C-7 and C-56 [receiving a single saline solution, intraperitoneal (i.p.), on the first day]; the AL-group, AL-7, and AL-56, received AL extract (300 mg/kg/daily); the Cd group, Cd-7 and Cd-56, received a single i.p. dose of CdCl2 (1.2 mg/kg body weight (BW)) on the first day; the CdAL group, CdAL-7 and CdAL-56, received the same Cd dose, followed by AL extract. Water or AL extract was administered daily by gavage. After either 7 or 56 days, the testis and accessory glands were removed after whole-body perfusion. Exposure to Cd and CdAL decreased the weight of the testis and epididymis, the gonadosomatic index, seminiferous tubular (ST) diameter, and ST volumetric proportion, and increased the volumetric proportion of interstitium after 56 days. In the epididymis caput, the tubular volumetric proportion decreased along with an increase of interstitial volumetric proportion and epithelium height after 56 days. The alterations observed were less severe only after 7 days. A progressive testicular damage resulted mainly in tubules lined only by Sertoli cells. The sperm number and cell debris decreased in the epididymis.

However, these test organisms offer great advantages in relation to other groups, due to the ease of obtaining breeders in cultivation systems, in the environment and any time, and due to their high sensitivity to chemicals or contaminants. To contribute some methodological aspects, this study uses techniques to stimulate spawning or improve the obtaining of gametes for use in bioassays with the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. It also evaluates different criteria for determining the effect on the larvae, for estimation of EC50 and NOEC values, based on morphological analysis of developmental delay and the biometrics of the larvae. KCl proved to be a reliable inducer of spawning, with positive responses in 10 of the 12 months of the year tested. Moreover, this chemical, in association with NH4Cl, demonstrated the capacity to activate immature oocytes obtained from extirpated gonads, enabling an improvement in fertilization rates. The different criteria adopted to determine the effects on the larvae in the assays with reference toxicants (SDS and K2Cr2O7) resulted in EC50 and NOEC values without significant differences, indicating reliability in the results and freedom in the choice of criteria of effect to be adopted in the trials. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","End point; KCl; NH4Cl; Oocyte activation; Short-duration chronic test; Spawning","ammonium chloride; bioassay; bivalve; embryo; gamete; larva; spawning; Article; bioassay; biometry; breeding; controlled study; developmental stage; EC50; embryo; embryo larval bioassay; gamete; larva; mussel; Mytilus galloprovincialis; nonhuman; oocyte; priority journal; spawning; species cultivation; animal; bioassay; embryology; Mytilus; procedures; reproducibility; Bivalvia; Mytilus edulis; Mytilus galloprovincialis; Animals; Biological Assay; Larva; Mytilus; Reproducibility of Results"

The objectives of this study were to determine the normal position of the fetal CM during pregnancy as well as the normal intradural filum terminale (FT) length and to evaluate their use in detecting tethered cord. Methods: This is a prospective evaluation of normal singleton pregnancies examined by sonography from 17 weeks of gestation to term. Each sonographer had to identify the top of the first sacral vertebra (S1) to measure the distance between it and the conus extremity (CM-S1 distance). The intradural FT distance was measured with 5- to 8-MHz probes. Results: 194 consecutive pregnant women were included. The CM and intradural FT were demonstrated clearly in 164 (84%) cases. The mean CM-S1 distance was 20.6 mm (range 0.5-42). The mean intradural FT distance was 27.9 mm (range 6.6-49.3). Linear regression analysis showed a significant association between both those distances and gestational age (p < 0.05). In cases of tethered cord, the mean CM-S1 distance and the mean intradural FT distance were both below the 5th percentile. Conclusion: Prenatal evaluation of the CM and the intradural FT is feasible and reproducible and seems useful in detecting tethered cord. © 2016 S.

Lactating females received daily, by gavage, doses of 10 μg/kg of EE diluted in 100 μl of mineral oil from the 1st to 10th postnatal day of the pups (EE group). In the control group (C), the lactating females received only the vehicle. Upon completing 120 days of age, the male offspring were euthanized and the prostates collected for analyses. We employed morphological, stereological-morphometrical, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural methods. The results showed that the postnatal exposure to EE doubled the prostatic complex weight, increasing the epithelial and stromal compartments, in addition to the secretory activity of the ventral lobe of the prostate. All glands exposed to EE showed strong stromal remodelling, and some foci of epithelial hyperplasia and inflammatory infiltrate in both luminal and epithelial or stromal compartments. Cells positive for anti-AR and anti-PCNA reactions increased into the epithelial and stromal tissues. ERα-positive cells, which are normally found in the stromal compartment of intact prostates, were frequently observed in the prostatic epithelium of treated animals. This study demonstrated that the exposure to EE during postnatal development causes histophysiological alterations in this gland, predisposing to the development of prostatic lesions during life. These results are important for public health, considering that women worldwide have commonly used EE. Moreover, the bioaccumulation of this chemical has increased in different ecosystems. © 2016 The Authors.

Metrics to assess the importance of habitats and pathways connecting habitats in a network are necessary to guide a variety of management decisions. Given the many metrics developed for spatially structured models, it can be challenging to select the most appropriate one for a particular decision. To guide the management of spatially structured populations, we define three classes of metrics describing habitat and pathway quality based on their data requirements (graph-based, occupancy-based, and demographic-based metrics) and synopsize the ecological literature relating to these classes. Applying the first steps of a formal decision-making approach (problem framing, objectives, and management actions), we assess the utility of metrics for particular types of management decisions. Our framework can help managers with problem framing, choosing metrics of habitat and pathway quality, and to elucidate the data needs for a particular metric. Our goal is to help managers to narrow the range of suitable metrics for a management project, and aid in decision-making to make the best use of limited resources. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

There are well-documented advantages in terms of quicker visual rehabilitation and reduced costs. The risk of bilateral simultaneous endophthalmitis and bilateral blindness is now recognized to be minuscule with the advent of intracameral antibiotics and modern management of endophthalmitis. Refractive surprises are rare for normal eyes and with the use of optical biometry. Where a general anesthetic is indicated for cataract surgery, the risk of death from a second anesthetic is much higher than the risk of blindness. A widely recognized protocol from the International Society of Bilateral Cataract Surgeons needs to be adhered to if surgeons wish to start practicing ISBCS. © 2016","Advantages and disadvantages; Immediately sequential bilateral cataract surgery; Simultaneous bilateral cataract surgery",

The 2.0×2.3×2.9 cm teratoma was found in the right ovary of 2.4×2.6×4.2 cm size. The teratoma was firmly encapsulated with cartilaginous tissue and its cross section revealed tufts of hair matted in thick, dried, yellow sebaceous material. Surprisingly the largest surface follicle of about 10 mm size was on the same ovary which was bearing teratoma however the follicular fluid (buFF) collected from that follicle was little.The opposite ovary of the genitalia was normal presenting few numbers of small follicles on the surface. The histopathological investigation of the teratoma revealed a wide variety of mature tissues foreign to the ovary like scattered areas of hair follicles, thyroid gland like structures, fibrous connective tissue, apocrine and sebaceous glands. The buff was assessed for biochemical parameters like cholesterol, ascorbic acid and nitric oxide and relevant hormones for determining its functional status. The concentrations of cholesterol and ascorbic acid were lower than the range reported in previous buffalo follicular fluid; however nitric oxide concentration was found to be much higher. The follicle was functionally inactive. Thus our study puts into records of findings of ovarian teratoma in water buffalo and its detailed microscopic study along with biometry and buFF composition. The possible culling of the animal may be because of the infertility caused by ovarian teratoma by disrupting the normal ovarian function. © 2016, Kasetsart University.

Setting Public hospital ophthalmology department. Design Retrospective case series. Methods Data from patients having uneventful cataract surgery with Acrysof IQ SN60WF IOL implantation over 5 years were obtained from the biometry and patient charts. Optimized lens constants were calculated for each formula and used to determine the predicted refractive outcome for each patient. This was compared with the actual refractive outcome to give the prediction error. Eyes were separated into subgroups based on axial length (AL) as follows: short (≤22.0 mm), medium (>22.0 to <24.5 mm), medium long (≥24.5 to <26.0 mm), and long (≥26.0 mm). Results The study included 3241 patients. The Barrett Universal II formula had the lowest mean absolute prediction error over the entire AL range (P < .001, all formulas) as well as in the medium (P < .001, all formulas), medium-long (P < .001, except Holladay 1 and T2), and long AL (P < .001, except T2) subgroups. No statistically significant difference was seen between formulas in the short AL subgroup. Overall, the Barrett Universal II formula resulted in the highest percentage of eyes with prediction errors between ±0.25 diopter D, ±0.50 D, and ±1.00 D. Conclusion In eyes with an AL longer than 22.0 mm, the Barrett Universal II formula was a more accurate predictor of actual postoperative refraction than the other formulas.

Methods In a prospective cross-sectional study at Tygerberg Hospital, South Africa, women with high-risk pregnancies but normal umbilical artery RI after 32 weeks underwent ultrasonography (fetal biometry, liquor, and placenta maturation) and Doppler assessment (uterine, umbilical, and middle cerebral arteries) between February 11 and October 21, 2013. Study data were compared among four groups: fetuses with normal uterofetoplacental Doppler values and those with any abnormal pulsatility index, each subdivided into small for gestational age (SGA) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) by estimated fetal weight. Results Of 210 participants, 72 (36.2%) had abnormal Doppler results, and 60 (28.6%) fetuses were SGA (38 [63.3%] with abnormal Doppler results). Clinical characteristics did not differ between groups with normal or abnormal Doppler values; however, among normal Doppler results, SGA pregnancies demonstrated poorer fundal growth (P=0.006).

Baseline demographics and biometry were analysed, and ocular co-morbidities documented. Intraoperative complications and the use of a capsular tension ring (CTR) were identified. Early and late best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) post surgery were determined using LogMar values. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to determine associations with BCVA post surgery, and further subgroup analysis performed in groups determined by CTR use.ResultsThe records of 22 312 consecutive eyes undergoing cataract surgery were reviewed. The incidence of zonular dialysis was 0.50% (111 eyes). A CTR was inserted in 46 eyes. Using a multivariate linear regression model, better initial pre-operative BCVA (P=0.019), the use of a CTR (P=0.014), and the absence of vitreous loss during surgery (P=0.008, β 0.45) were associated with improved early postoperative BCVA (mean follow-up 6.6 weeks). Better medium-Term postoperative BCVA was significantly associated with preoperative BCVA (P=0.002) and the use of a CTR during surgery (P=0.004, β-0.41).ConclusionsThe overall incidence of zonular dialysis is low.

Methods The refractive status and axial length of first-year students at the School of Sciences, University of Minho, were measured in 2014. Refractive error was measured with subjective refraction under cycloplegia and axial length was measured by optical biometry. The data were compared with those obtained from a similar cohort of 111 students in 2002. Myopia was defined as a mean spherical equivalent of ≤-0.50D. A survey was conducted to know the routine of the participants. They were asked how many hours per week (hrs/wk) they had spent, on average in the previous year, watching TV, using the computer, studying, participating in manual hobbies, and participating in outdoor activities. Results In 2014, 75 students were assessed (15 male and 60 female) with a mean age (mean Â± SD) of 19.8 Â± 1.6 years (ranging from 18 to 24 years). The mean refractive error M (spherical equivalent) was -0.77 Â± 1.79D and the axial length was 23.74 Â± 1.19 mm. The prevalence of myopia was 41.3% (31 of 75). In 2002, the mean refractive error M was 0.01 Â± 1.53D, the axial length was 23.40 Â± 0.93 mm, and the myopia prevalence was 23.4% (26 of 111). The differences between myopia prevalence and mean refractive error are statistically significant (p < 0.05). A statistically significant increase in the number of hrs/wk spent on near activities (p < 0.05) was found. Conclusions In 12 years, the prevalence of myopia among first-year university students at the School of Sciences of the University of Minho rose from 23.4 to 41.3%.

Correlation and linear regression analyses were performed for all subjects. The magnification effect was adjusted by the modified axial length method.RESULTS: Disc area and spherical equivalent were positively correlated (r = 0.225, r2 = 0.051, p = 0.000). RNFL thickness showed significant correlations with spherical equivalent (r = 0.359, r2 = 0.129, p = 0.000), axial length (r = -0.262, r2 = 0.069, p = 0.000), disc radius (r = 0.359, r2 = 0.129, p = 0.000), and radius of the scan circle (r = -0.262, r2 = 0.069, p = 0.000). After adjustment for the magnification effect, those relationships were reversed; RNFL thickness showed negative correlation with spherical equivalent and disc radius, and positive correlation with axial length and radius of the scan circle. The distance between the disc margin and the scan circle was closely correlated with RNFL thickness (r = -0.359, r2 = 0.129, p = 0.000), which showed a negative correlation with axial length (r = -0.262, r2 = 0.069, p = 0.000).CONCLUSIONS: Optic disc radius and RNFL thickness decreased in more severely myopic eyes, but they increased after adjustment for magnification effect. The error due to the magnification effect and optic nerve head size difference might be factors that should be considered when interpreting optical coherence tomography results.","Myopia; Optic nerve; Optical coherence tomography","adult; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; disease course; eye refraction; female; human; male; myopia; nerve fiber; optic disk; optical coherence tomography; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; retina ganglion cell; young adult; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Male; Myopia; Nerve Fibers; Optic Disk; Refraction, Ocular; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Young Adult"

Design: Prospective, non-randomized case control study. Participant: Three hundred and twenty one children were enrolled in the study from Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, Tongren Eye Care Center and Beijing Beiyi Optometry & Ophthalmology Center. 141 children (43.9%, 141/321) completed the follow up, with a mean age of 11.41±2.29 years. Methods: All children received a comprehensive examination, including visual acuity, cycloplegia refraction, slit lamp, Lenstar ocular biometry, color fundus photographs and were followed up one year later. Parents selected the types of correction on their own. Main Outcome Measures: Change of refraction, axial length and parapapillary atrophy before and after wearing. Results: The mean equivalent spherical(SE) and axial length(AL) of 141 children at baseline were -2.89±1.34 D and 24.92±0.34 mm, respectively. At one-year follow-up visit, elongation of AL in children with OK was 0.13±0.16 mm, significantly less than the other two groups (F=48.820, P<0.001). Progression of myopia was -0.77±0.79 D and -0.94±0.47 D in SV group and PD group respectively. There was no significant difference between groups (t=1.080, P=0.283). Presence of enlargement of parapapillary atrophy in OK group was 15.0%, significantly lower than SV group (66.7%) and PD group (38.6%). Conclusions: Compared to single vision spectacle lenses and peripheral defocus spectacle lenses, orthokeratology is most effective for myopia control.

Romosinuano (ROMO) and Blanco Orejinegro (BON) are the most common breeds used by Colombian cattle breeders. Growth traits are of prime importance in these animals, which are mainly raised for beef production. Genes encoding growth hormone, growth hormone receptor, homeobox protein, insulin growth factor binding protein 3, leptin, and myostatin have been associated with physiological growth pathways in cattle and other species. We therefore aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these genes in ROMO, BON, and Zebu cattle. DNA regions of these genes were sequenced in 386 animals; 47 new SNPs were found, of which 14 were located in the exonic regions, thereby changing the protein sequence. An association of SNPs with weaning weight (WW), daily weight gain at weaning (DWG), and weight at 16 months (W16M) traits was deduced. The genetic analysis revealed several SNPs related to these traits. The SNP GhRE06.2 had a significant association with WW and the SNP Lep03.4 was highly associated with DWG and W16M. Other polymorphisms were significantly associated with WW and DWG, although they did not surpass the Bonferroni significance threshold. The new mutations identified may indicate important points of genetic control in the DNA that could be responsible for changes in the expression of the analyzed traits. These SNPs might be used in future breeding programs to improve the productive performance of cattle in beef farms. © 2016 The Authors.","Blanco Orejinegro; Creole cattle; Growth traits; Romosinuano; SNP","growth hormone; growth hormone receptor; animal; biometry; body weight; bovine; Colombia; genetics; growth, development and aging; nucleotide sequence; phenotype; selective breeding; single nucleotide polymorphism; Animals; Base Sequence; Biometry; Body Weight; Cattle; Colombia; Growth Hormone; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, Somatotropin; Selective Breeding"

The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with 20 arabica coffee cultivars grown in nutrient solution with a low potassium level (1.5 mM), using a randomized block design with three replicates. The traits evaluated were plant height, number of leaves, number of nodes, internode length, stem diameter, leaf area, rooting efficiency, potassium absorption efficiency, potassium translocation efficiency, biomass production efficiency, and potassium use efficiency. Genetic variability among coffee cultivars for all the evaluated traits was found. The phenotypic variance for all traits showed a higher contribution of genetic variance compared to environmental variance. Plant height, internode length, stem diameter, leaf area, biomass production efficiency, and potassium use efficiency had a genotypic determination coefficient (H2) above 80% and variation index greater than one. Leaf area and stem diameter had significant and positive genetic correlations with rooting, biomass production, and potassium use efficiencies.

The reliability and appropriateness of management decisions concerning ecosystem services and resources are directly correlated with the accuracy and extent of the available information on forests and related dynamics. Historically, forest resource management activities informed by decision support systems, have largely relied on field measurements, often with sparse geographical, temporal, and ecological coverage. In contrast, remotely-sensed data can provide dense temporal coverage over large areas. Landsat data in particular have spatial and temporal characteristics well-suited to capturing forest changes on the landscape. Since 2008 free and open access to analysis-ready data representing more than 40 years of data in the Landsat archive has created new opportunities for forest monitoring. There is however, a need to link forest information generated from remotely-sensed data to the data input needs of decision support systems. Here, we develop such a linkage between field and remotely-sensed observations to characterize one of the main drivers of forest change: growth. The goal of this research is to produce above-ground biomass (AGB) change estimates that integrate the information of re-measured field plots and that of the Landsat time series. Over a large test area (∼3.3 Mha) in Saskatchewan, Canada, we demonstrate how information from a dense Landsat time series (1984–2012) can be used with a network of field plots to estimate change in AGB over the broad geographical, temporal, and ecological range of these forests. Our approach expands forest growth estimation both spatially and temporally, and results in information layers that are directly ingestible in decision support models. Our results show that trends match between the field plots and the remote-sensing-field-combined estimate, but that the more encompassing spatial estimates give more varied and lower average estimates of AGB change for our study region. We hypothesize that integrating both remotely-sensed information and repeated field measurements covers a wider range of ecological conditions, forest productivity, and forest developmental stages present on the landscape and through time than the field plots alone. The next step in our research is to integrate our findings into the forest resource management decision support tools, with the aim of increasingly spatializing what are usually spatially-referenced models. Our findings highlight emergent synergies between complementary data sources that foster the generation of new information products for forest resources management decision support. © 2016","Forest biometrics; Forest modelling; Forest productivity; Landsat","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Gas absorption; Greenhouse gases; Natural resources; Natural resources management; Productivity; Remote sensing; Resource allocation; Time series; Decision support models; Forest modelling; Forest productivity; Forest resource managements; Forest resources managements; LANDSAT; Remotely-sensed observations; Temporal characteristics; Information management; aboveground biomass; biometry; decision support system; ecosystem service; environmental conditions; forest dynamics; forest product; forest resource; greenhouse gas; Landsat; landscape change; numerical model; remote sensing; resource management; time series; Canada; Saskatchewan"

IOL Master is usually used to the biometric measurement of the silicone tamponade eye in well-equipped hospital, but it is still disabled in serious cataractous eyes. Corrective B or A-type ultrasound methods have been used for a fewer years, but these measured results are incomparable probably due to the difference of viscosity of silicone oils. Objective: This study attempted to investigate the accuracy of B-type ultrasonography for ocular axial length (AL) measurement in silicone tamponade eyes. Methods: The transmitting speed of ultrasonic wave in the silicone oil was determined by comparing the outcomes between balance solution mesuring and 5 500 mPas silicone oil, and a calculating formula for corrective ocular AL in 5 500 mPas silicone filled eyes was further established. Thirty-two eyes of 30 patients who received 5 500 mPas silicone oil tamponade due to complex retinal detachment were enrolled in Qingdao Hiser Medical Group from May 2012 to March 2014. The eyes were assigned to the AL<26 mm group (18 eyes of 16 patients) and AL≥26 mm group (14 eyes of 14 patients). B-scan ultrasound and IOL Master were used to measure the AL before the removal of the silicone oil, and the Als were measured again using A-scan ultrasound and B-scan ultrasound 3 months after the removal of the silicone oil. The outcomes were compared and the correlations were evaluated among different measuring methods. The vitrous length values before and after removal of the oils, and the diopters before and after intraocular pressure (IOP) implantation were compared to varify the results of B-type sonography for 5 500 mPas silicone-tamponade eyes. Results: The transmitting speed of sound wave in 5 500 mPas silicone oil was 1 023 m/second with the conversion factor 0. 668 between silicon oil eyes and vitreous cavity, and the corrected formula for AL measurement was;the length form cornea apex to the posterior pole of lens or the center of the capsular membrane+ 0. 668x the length form posterior pole of lens or the center of the capsular membrane to the macular area. No significnant differences were found in the AL values among the corrective-B scan, IOL Master method, postoperative B-scan method and A-scan method both in the AL<26 mm group and the AL≥26 mm group (AL<26 ram; F = 0.108, P = 0.955 ; AL≥26 mm: F = 0.011, P = 0.998), and the AL values by corrective B-scan was significantly correlated with that by IOL Master, postoperative B-scan and A-scan, respectively ( AL<26 mm group: r = 0.876, 0.921, 0.809, all at P<0.01; AL<26 mm group: r = 0.943, 0.956, 0.955, all at P<0.01). The vitreous cavity depth was (20. 78± 2. 13) mm by corrective B-scan in 1 day before the removal of silicone, and that in 3 months after removal of silicone was (20. 89±2. 16) mm, without statistical diference between them (t = 0.795, P = 0.219). The actual postoperative refraction in 16 eyes with IOL was (-1.25±1.69) D, and preoperative refrection was (-1.50±0.00) D, the difference was not statistically significant (t = 0.585, P = 0.284). Conclusions: The biometry of B-scan ultrasonography for silicone-tamponade eye is accurate and simple, with a good feasibility in clinical measurement.

The mean CCT measurements were statistically different among the three groups (p = 0.002). CCT measurements obtained using RTVue-OCT were significantly thinner than those obtained using UP (p = 0.009). Sirius CCT measurements were also thinner than UP (p = 0.011). Mean CCT measurements between UP and Lenstar were similar (p = 0.769). Measurements with Lenstar (r = 0.849), Sirius topography (r = 0.883), and RTVue OCT (0.949) were highly correlated with UP measurements. Conclusion: RTVue OCT and Sirius topography significantly underestimated the CCT compared with UP. Although highly correlated, the measurement values with these devices are not directly interchangeable in clinical practice. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

Subjects and methods: The intraocular pressures, anterior segment biometrics (axial length: AL; Central corneal thickness: CCT; Lens thickness: LT; Anterior chamber depth: ACD), and refractive measurements of 30 eyes of 15 fasting healthy male volunteers were recorded at 8:00 in the morning and 17:00 in the evening in the Ramadan of 2013 and two months later. The results were compared and the statistical analyses were performed using the Rstudio software version 0.98.501. The variables were investigated using visual (histograms, probability plots) and analytical methods (Kolmogorov-Smirnov/Shapiro-Wilk test) to determine whether or not they were normally distributed. Results: The refractive values remained stable in the fasting as well as in the control period (p = 0.384). The axial length measured slightly shorter in the fasting period (p = 0.001). The corneal thickness presented a diurnal variation, in which the cornea measured thinner in the evening. The difference between the fasting and control period was not statistically significant (p = 0.359). The major differences were observed in the anterior chamber depth and IOP. The ACD was shallower in the evening during the fasting period, where it was deeper in the control period. The diurnal IOP difference was greater in the fasting period than the control period. Both were statistically significant (p = 0.001). The LT remained unchanged in both periods. Conclusions: The major difference was shown in the anterior chamber shallowing in the evening hours and IOP. Our study contributes the hypothesis that the posterior segment of the eye is more responsible for the axial length alterations and normovolemia has a more dominant influence on diurnal IOP changes. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

Design Interinstrument reliability analysis. Methods A total of 62 eyes from 62 young adults were included in the study. Average keratometry (AveK) and simulated keratometry (SimK) along 2.0-mm-ring measurements provided by Pentacam HR, keratometry readings provided by IOLMaster 700, and central corneal thickness (CCT) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) values obtained from both devices were recorded. J0 and J45 vectoral components of astigmatism were obtained using power vector analysis. Mean keratometry (Km) values of IOLMaster 700 were compared for each type of Km value from Pentacam HR, while other parameters were compared between devices. To assess the agreement between measurements of the devices, Bland-Altman analysis was performed. Results The Pentacam HR exhibited significantly lower Km and CCT measurements (P < .001, for all); however, no significant difference emerged in J0, J45, and ACD measurements (P = .057, P = .574, and P = .64, respectively).

Methods-We conducted a prospective cohort study of pregnancies complicated by pregestational or gestational diabetes and delivered after 38 weeks. Two-dimensional and 3D sonographic examinations were performed for fetal biometry and factional thigh volumes at 34 to 37 weeks. Fetal weight was estimated by Hadlock's 2D formula IV, which uses only 2D biometry, and formula 6 from Lee et al (Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol 2009; 34:556-565), which incorporates 3D fractional thigh volume and 2D biometry. The gestation-adjusted projection method was used to estimate predicted birth weights from 2D and 3D estimates. The primary outcome was fetal macrosomia, which was defined as birth weight of 4000 g or higher. Results-A total of 115 women with diabetes met inclusion criteria, and 17 (14.8%) delivered macrosomic neonates. The mean percentage error was significantly lower for the 2D than the 3D projected estimate (1.0% versus 12.0%; P < .01). The standard deviation of the mean percentage error was also significantly lower for the 2D projected estimate (10.2% versus 17.2%; P< .01). Two-dimensional biometry was overall superior to 3D biometry for predicting macrosomia (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.88 versus 0.75; P = .03). Specificity was significantly higher for 2D biometry (85% versus 66%; P < .01), whereas the difference in sensitivity was not statistically significant (59% versus 71%; P = .22).

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: A teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Population: A total of 10 527 Chinese women with a singleton pregnancy having a second- or third-trimester fetal anomaly or growth scan between January 2009 and June 2014. Methods: Z-scores were derived for fetal abdominal circumference (AC), head circumference (HC), and femur length (FL) using the INTERGROWTH-21st and Chinese biometry standards. Pregnancies with aneuploidy, structural or skeletal abnormalities, or that developed pre-eclampsia were excluded. Z-scores were stratified as &lt;2.5th, &lt;5th, &lt;10th, &gt;90th, &gt;95th, or &gt;97.5th percentile. Birthweight centile, adjusted for gestation and gender, was categorised as ≤3rd, 3rd to ≤5th, 5th to ≤10th, and &gt;10th. Pairwise comparison and the McNemar test were performed to assess biometry Z-score differences and concordance between the INTERGROWTH-21st and Chinese standards. Main outcome measures: The sensitivity of both the local and INTERGROWTH-21st AC standards to identify pregnancies that were small-for-gestational-age (SGA) was assessed. Results: INTERGROWTH-21st AC, HC, and FL Z-scores were significantly lower than those obtained using our local reference for AC, HC, and FL (P &lt; 0.0001 for all).

Methods: A custom-built spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) system with high-speed and ultra-long scan depth was used to image the anterior segment, whereas a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor was used to detect the whole-eye aberration. A Badal optometer with switched visual targets was integrated with this system to induce 0 and 3.00 D accommodative stimuli. Three young adult subjects were measured and the structural parameters of anterior segment were measured from OCT images and accommodative response and HOAs were calculated and exponentially fitted in real time during the accommodation. Results: The dynamic process from nonaccommodation to 3.00 D accommodation results in reduced pupil diameter, shallower anterior chamber depth, and increased crystalline lens thickness. After an accommodative active time, the RMS of the HOAs changes sharply when an accommodative stimulus is introduced and then tends to be stable. The accommodative response time and velocity are characterized by fitted parameters. The individual differences of changing in HOAs between subjects can be explained by the different sign and changing tendency of certain terms of aberration coefficients in form of Zernike polynomials during the accommodation. Conclusions: Based on the integrated ocular measurement platform including OCT system and wavefront sensor, our research demonstrated how the morphology of the human anterior segment affect the aberration in real time during accommodation. The dynamic relationship between them helps us to deeply understand the mechanism of accommodation. © 2015 Contact Lens Association of Ophthalmologists.","Accommodation; Anterior segment; Optical coherence tomography; Wavefront aberration","accommodation; adult; anterior eye chamber depth; anterior eye segment; Article; biometry; case report; corneal wavefront aberration; female; human; lens; male; micro contact lens; optical biosensor; optical coherence tomography device; optometer; priority journal; pupil; response time; sensorimotor integration; spectral domain optical coherence tomography; visual stimulation; visual system parameters; accommodation; anatomy and histology; anterior eye segment; biometry; corneal wavefront aberration; diagnostic imaging; emmetropia; eye refraction; optical coherence tomography; pathology; physiology; procedures; Accommodation, Ocular; Adult; Anterior Eye Segment; Biometry; Corneal Wavefront Aberration; Emmetropia; Female; Humans; Lens, Crystalline; Male; Refraction, Ocular; Tomography, Optical Coherence"

A device known as corneal topographer is used for capturing the shape of each cornea. Until now only a few studies on corneal biometry have been conducted and they were limited only to the anterior surface. In this study, since the whole cornea is a tissue layered by two (anterior and posterior) surfaces, the authors propose to use both surfaces to characterise the corneal shape. The first proposed method consists of comparing coefficients from a spherical harmonics decomposition, and this allows to do a fast comparison that can be used to perform many-to-one comparisons. The second approach is based on the minimal residual volume between two corneas after a registration step, this geometry-based method is more accurate but slower, and is thus used to perform one-to-one comparisons. A cascade fusion scheme is also proposed to benefit from the advantages of both methods. The authors' study demonstrates that corneal shape could be used for biometry. The two proposed methods have been tested and validated on a dataset of 257 corneas. © 2016, Institution of Engineering and Technology. All rights reserved.",,

Spacerowa 10, Opole, Poland","Data collected out of the breeding season suggest that House sparrows (Passer domesticus) from the urban populations are characterized by a smaller body size and poorer body condition compared to birds from rural populations. Considering an urbanized Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and other potential predators, a new predator-prey dependency is developing that can also be a reason for the House sparrow’s poorer condition. This study was aimed at comparing the multivariate biometrical characteristics and few body condition indices of adult birds from urban and rural populations during the breeding season. It was hypothesized that a higher predation risk during the breeding season concerns mainly males, thus affecting their poorer condition. Most of the condition indices of males were significantly lower in the urban population. Males from the urban populations had lower body mass, shorter tarsus, longer alula, greater Kipp’s distance and higher wing pointedness index in comparison to the birds from rural populations, whereas these differences were not found between females. We suggest that the lower body condition and biometric differences in the analyzed birds are a means of adapting to the new predator-prey scheme in accordance to the tradeoff theory between starvation and predation risks. A lower condition of birds in poor foraging urban habitats and higher predation risk may be indicative of a declining population. © 2016, The Author(s).","Adaptation traits; Bird flight’s adaptation; Body condition index; House Sparrow population decline; Morphometry; Natural selection; Urban birds",

Methods: Bilateral sequential cataract surgery was performed in 38 patients. Preoperative mannitolization was done in one eye of each subject. We checked the change in preoperative ocular biometry before and after intravenous mannitolization. We compared the postoperative corneal endothelial cell density between eyes with mannitolization and without mannitolization at postoperative week 1, 2, 5, and 8. We evaluated the relationship between change in ocular biometry and change in postoperative corneal endothelial cells in eyes that underwent preoperative mannitolization. Results: After mannitolization, eyes exhibited decreased intraocular pressure, axial length (AL), and vitreous chamber depth (VCD) and increased anterior chamber depth (ACD) and lens position (LP) compared to before mannitolization (p < 0.05). Preoperative mannitolization has a tendency to decrease the intraoperative use of phaco energy in eyes with moderate nucleosclerosis. Eyes with preoperative mannitolization showed less loss of postoperative corneal endothelial cells than eyes without preoperative mannitolization (p < 0.05). The ACD, LP, and AL changes by mannitolization were all negatively correlated with corneal endothelial cell loss (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Preoperative mannitolization can decrease postoperative loss of corneal endothelial cells. The protective effect of preoperative mannitolization on the corneal endothelium may be due to the decreased need for phaco energy and changes in ocular biometry such as ACD, AL, and LP. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Cataract surgery; corneal endothelium; mannitolization; ocular biometry; phaco energy",

A single intraocular lens (IOL) type was used for all cases. Main outcome measures included perioperative complications and refractive outcome. Results: Two hundred and twenty-one eyes were identified. Intraoperatively, two eyes (0.9 %) had unstable capsular bag and three (1.4 %) had posterior capsular rupture. At a mean follow-up duration was 27.4 ± 14.6 months, three eyes (1.5 % of 198 eyes with no history of retinal detachment or macular hole) developed retinal detachment. There was an overall hyperopic shift with a mean biometry error of 0.45 ± 1.21 D in all eyes. The mean absolute biometry prediction error was 0.98 ± 0.83 D in all eyes, 1.11 ± 0.86 D and 0.85 ± 0.82 D in eyes receiving negative- and positive-power IOL, respectively (p = 0.042). A total of 61.2 % of eyes had refractive outcome within ± 1.0 D of target spherical equivalent. Regression analysis showed low IOL power as an independent predictor for greater postoperative absolute biometry error (p = 0.014). Conclusions: We showed no increase in perioperative complications in eyes with extreme high axial myopia. In eyes with long axial length, implantation of IOL with lower power was associated with more hyperopic shift, which was more pronounced with negative-power IOL. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biometry; Cataract surgery; Complications; High myopia; Retinal detachment","cataract; complication; eye refraction; female; follow up; Hong Kong; human; incidence; lens implant; male; middle aged; myopia; pathophysiology; phacoemulsification; Postoperative Complications; procedures; retrospective study; severity of illness index; time factor; treatment outcome; visual acuity; Cataract; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hong Kong; Humans; Incidence; Lenses, Intraocular; Male; Middle Aged; Myopia; Phacoemulsification; Postoperative Complications; Refraction, Ocular; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Visual Acuity"

Biometric and refractive data were analysed for 43 eyes, including prediction errors (PE). Statistical measures used included mean absolute error (MAE), median absolute error (MedAE), Student's t-test and Lin's correlation coefficient.ResultsThe mean PE using the SRK-II formula was +0.96 D (range -2.47D to +2.41 D, SD 1.33 D, MAE 1.38 D, MedAE 1.55, n=15). The mean PE was smaller using SRK/T (-0.18 D, range -3.25 D to +3.95 D, SD 1.70 D, MAE 1.30 D, MedAE 1.24, n=27). We performed an analysis of the biometry data using four different formula (Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, SRK-II and SRK/T). Hoffer Q showed a smaller MedAE than other formulae but also a myopic bias.ConclusionOur clinical data suggest SRK/T was more accurate in predicting post-operative refraction in this cohort of paediatric patients undergoing cataract surgery.

Thalassiosira lentiginosa (Janisch) Fryxell, a large centric diatom which is the second most abundant species in the Southern Ocean, conversely received very little attention to date. We here present the first study on modern sediments to explore the variability of the mean valve area of T. lentiginosa in relation to productivity and modern environmental conditions. Larger T. lentiginosa are observed around the Polar Front Zone with size decreasing both northward and southward as previously observed for F. kerguelensis. Such a pattern neither corresponds to the species productivity changes nor with the iron concentration in surface waters. Conversely, this pattern may be partly due to the low efficiency of Si uptake, internal transport and deposition of silicic acid under conditions which are outside of the species specific temperature range, i.e. at the lower and upper limit of the diatom ecological preferences. We also propose that T. lentiginosa mean valve area variations in four deep-sea cores across the frontal zones in the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean resulted from changes in sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice presence modulating the species ability to make use nutrient stocks and controlling the length of its growing season, respectively. Our results also indicate that T. lentiginosa exported more biogenic silica to the sea-floor than F. kerguelensis over the last 42 kyrs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biometry; Diatoms; Environmental conditions; Nutrient cycling; Southern Ocean","Bacillariophyta; Coscinodiscophyceae; Fragilariopsis kerguelensis; Thalassiosira lentiginosa"

Reduced placental perfusion is an important pathogenic component of IUGR; substances that enhance vasodilation in the uterine circulation, such as sildenafil citrate (sildenafil), may improve placental blood flow and fetal growth. This study aimed to examine the effects of sildenafil in the growth-restricted ovine fetus. Ewes carrying singleton pregnancies underwent insertion of vascular catheters, and then, they were randomized to receive uterine artery embolization (IUGR) or to a control group. Ewes in the IUGR group received a daily infusion of sildenafil (IUGR+SC; n=10) or vehicle (IUGR+V; n=8) for 21 days. The control group received no treatment (n=9). Umbilical artery blood flow was measured using Doppler ultrasound and the resistive index (RI) calculated. Fetal weight, biometry, and placental weight were obtained at postmortem after treatment completion. Umbilical artery RI in IUGR+V fell less than in controls; the RI of IUGR+SC was intermediate to that of the other 2 groups (mean±SEM for control versus IUGR+V versus IUGR+SC: ΔRI, 0.09±0.03 versus -0.01±0.02 versus 0.03±0.02; F(2, 22)=4.21; P=0.03). Compared with controls, lamb and placental weights were reduced in IUGR+V but not in IUGR+SC (control versus IUGR+V versus IUGR+SC: fetal weight, 4381±247 versus 3447±235 versus 3687±129 g; F(2, 24)=5.49; P=0.01 and placental weight: 559.7±35.0 versus 376.2±32.5 versus 475.2±42.5 g; F(2, 24)=4.64; P=0.01). Sildenafil may be a useful adjunct in the management of IUGR.

Methods: 188 eyes of 101 subjects were included in the study. Measurements of axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), corneal power (K1 and K2) and the measurement failure rate with the new Zeiss IOLMaster 700 were compared with those obtained with the IOLMaster 500. The results were evaluated using Bland-Altman analyses. The differences between both methods were assessed using the paired samples t test, and their correlation was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The mean age was 68.32±12.71 years and the male/female ratio was 29/72. The agreements between two devices were outstanding regarding AL (ICC=1.0), ACD (ICC=0.920), K1 (ICC=0.992) and K2 (ICC=0.989) values. IOLMaster 700 was able to measure ACD AL, K1 and K2 in all eyes within high-quality SD limits of the manufacturer. IOLMaster 500 was able to measure ACD in 175 eyes, whereas measurements were not possible in the remaining 13 eyes. AL measurements were not possible for 17 eyes with IOLMaster 500. Nine of these eyes had posterior subcapsular cataracts and eight had dense nuclear cataracts.

Deiodinase type 2 (Dio2) catalyzes the conversion of the prohormone T4 into the transcriptionally active T3 and is the predominant activating deiodinase in zebrafish. Using zinc finger nucleases, we generated two different dio2 mutant zebrafish lines to investigate the physiological function of this TH activator. The first line contains a deletion of 9 bp, resulting in an in-frame elimination of three conserved amino acids. The other line is characterized by an insertion of 4 bp, leading to the introduction of a premature stop-codon. Both lines completely lack Dio2 activity, resulting in a strong reduction of T3 abundancy in all tissues tested. Early development is clearly perturbed in these animals, as shown by a diverse set of morphometric parameters, defects in swim bladder inflation, and disturbed locomotor activity tested between 1 and 7 days after fertilization. Permanent Dio2 deficiency also provokes long-term effects because growth and especially fertility are severely hampered. Possible compensatory mechanisms were investigated in adult dio2 mutants, revealing a down-regulation of the inactivating deiodinase Dio3 and TH receptor transcript levels. As the firstnonmammalianmodelwith permanent Dio2 deficiency, these mutant zebrafish lines provide evidence that Dio2 is essential to assure normal development and to obtain a normal adult phenotype. © Copyright 2016 by the Endocrine Society.",,"deiodinase type 1; deiodinase type 2; deiodinase type 3a; deiodinase type 3b; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1B; initiation factor; iodide peroxidase; liothyronine; messenger RNA; ribosomal protein L13a; unclassified drug; zinc finger nuclease; iodide peroxidase; iodothyronine deiodinase type II; thyroid hormone; adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; down regulation; embryo; embryo development; enzyme activity; enzyme inactivation; female; female fertility; fertilization; gene deletion; growth; heterozygosity; homozygosity; larva; locomotion; male; male fertility; morphometrics; nonhuman; priority journal; stop codon; swim bladder; upregulation; zebra fish; animal; biometry; blood; deficiency; fertility; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; molecular genetics; mutation; nucleotide sequence; Western blotting; Animals; Base Sequence; Biometry; Blotting, Western; Female; Fertility; Iodide Peroxidase; Locomotion; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Thyroid Hormones; Zebrafish"

Genes and the shared environment influenced growth in numeracy for girls, while for boys it was influenced by the shared and unique environment. These results suggest that individual differences in growth of reading are primarily due to a genetically influenced developmental delay in the acquisition of necessary skills, while environmental influences, perhaps including different schools or teachers, are more important for the other domains. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Academic achievement; Genetic influences; Growth; Numeracy; Reading; Twins","academic achievement; Article; Australian; biometry; child; comprehension; environmental factor; female; grammar; growth curve; heredity; human; learning; longitudinal study; male; mathematics; numeracy; reading; school child; spelling; twins; writing; Australia; genetics; genotype environment interaction; inheritance; literacy; phenotype; school; student; Australia; Biometry; Female; Gene-Environment Interaction; Humans; Inheritance Patterns; Literacy; Male; Phenotype; Reading; Schools; Students"

Material and Methods: This prospective cohort study was conducted on singleton pregnancies followed until delivery. Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were evaluated with respect to the msPAPP-A level at the 11th–14th weeks, uterine artery Doppler velocimetry at the 15th–18th weeks, and FBMs at the 20th–24th and 28th–32nd weeks of pregnancy. Results: One hundred fifty-eight women constituted the study group; 17 (10.75%) of them had at least one poor pregnancy outcome. The cut-off point of 0.72 multiple of the median (MoM) for the PAPP-A level achieved a sensitivity of 82.4% and a specificity of 29.8% for poor pregnancy outcomes. The mean birth weight was significantly lower in the subgroup with a higher mean pulsatility index of uterine arteries (UAPImean≥1.19) (p=0.025) as well as in the subgroup with a higher mean resistance index of uterine arteries (UARImean≥0.62) (p=0.013). When the subgroup of pregnant women under the risk of early-onset IUGR according to FBMs was compared to the low-risk group, statistically significant differences were seen in terms of pregnancy outcomes (p=0.045) and birth weight (p=0.011). Conclusion: Maternal serum PAPP-A level and FBMs could be used for predicting pregnancy outcomes, while uterine artery Doppler velocimetry and FBMs could be used for predicting neonatal outcomes, specifically the birth weight. © 2016 by the Turkish-German Gynecological Education and Research Foundation.","Color; Doppler; Fetal biometry; Fetal development; Pregnancy outcome; Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-a; Ultrasonography",

These oscillations are sampled at 700 Hz and processed in order to detect peaks of movement. The value of these peaks could be used as a reference to make adjustments to the operating parameters of the sprayer, with the aim of improving spray deposition and reducing drift. Results show that the electro-leaves estimate different airflows as a function of the air volume, the tractor forward speed and the canopy sizes.

Morphological integration and modularity provide a powerful framework for the analysis of the evolution of morphological traits. We used geometric morphometrics and phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC) to test four different modularity hypotheses in the haptoral anchors of 14 monogenean species of Ligophorus. Integration between the modular units identified was further evaluated with two-block partial least squares analysis. Roots and points represented two modules in the dorsal and ventral anchors, but modularity was not statistically supported when parasite phylogeny was accounted for, which may indicate convergent evolution related to host characteristics and gill morphology. In contrast, PIC revealed medial and lateral modules in ventral anchors only. Moreover, we found evidence for ventral and dorsal anchor pairs forming two modules, supporting the notion that they play different functional roles. Integration between all identified modules was strong. We conclude that there is modular structure in the anchors of Ligophorus spp., accounted by adaptive and phylogenetic factors acting at different levels, and ventral and dorsal anchors evolve as integrated modules with specific roles in attachment. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Haptor; Ligophorus spp; Modularity; Morphological evolution; Morphological integration","allometry; anatomical concepts; Article; convergent evolution; evolution; gene sequence; gill; haptoral anchor structure; Ligophorus; Monogenea; morphological adaptation; morphometrics; nonhuman; phenotype; phylogenetic tree; phylogenetically independent contrast; priority journal; anatomy and histology; animal; biometry; classification; parasitology; phylogeny; physiology; Smegmamorpha; trematode; Animals; Biological Evolution; Biometry; Gills; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Smegmamorpha; Trematoda"

Knowledge of the structure of a fitness landscape can thus predict evolutionary outcomes. Empirical fitness landscapes, however, have so far only offered limited insight into real-world questions, as the high dimensionality of sequence spaces makes it impossible to exhaustively measure the fitness of all variants of biologically meaningful sequences. We must therefore revert to statistical descriptions of fitness landscapes that are based on a sparse sample of fitness measurements. It remains unclear, however, how much data are required for such statistical descriptions to be useful. Here, we assess the ability of regression models accounting for single and pairwise mutations to correctly approximate a complex quasi-empirical fitness landscape. We compare approximations based on various sampling regimes of an RNA landscape and find that the sampling regime strongly influences the quality of the regression. On the one hand it is generally impossible to generate sufficient samples to achieve a good approximation of the complete fitness landscape, and on the other hand systematic sampling schemes can only provide a good description of the immediate neighborhood of a sequence of interest. Nevertheless, we obtain a remarkably good and unbiased fit to the local landscape when using sequences from a population that has evolved under strong selection. Thus, current statistical methods can provide a good approximation to the landscape of naturally evolving populations. © 2016 The Author.","epistasis; fitness landscapes; penalized regression; RNA secondary structure","epistasis; landscape; mutation; neighborhood; protein secondary structure; sampling; statistical analysis; statistical model; adaptation; biological model; biometry; epistasis; evolution; genetic selection; genetics; human; molecular evolution; procedures; reproductive fitness; sequence analysis; RNA; Adaptation, Physiological; Biological Evolution; Biometry; Epistasis, Genetic; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Fitness; Humans; Models, Genetic; Models, Statistical; Mutation; RNA; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, RNA"

However, there is little knowledge on how the relationships established between those variables change between trees from different urban areas or species, especially within Great Britain (GB). This study aims to evaluate the variation in the allometric relationships of seven tree species growing in eight GB urban areas, and to understand if the use of generic curves representing relationships of trees growing across all locations is adequate. The variation between locations was highly significant; nevertheless, mean relationships of young trees growing in different locations were still accurately represented by a common species curve. Species with a similar stature also showed significant differences in their mean allometric relationships, reducing the level of accuracy when estimating mean relationships with multiple-species curves. Findings also suggest that crown width could be correctly predicted from DBH measurements. This knowledge can be used in citizen science based surveys, where the measurement of crown width is required but often challenging. © 2016","Allometry; Crown width; Diameter at breast height; Ecosystem services assessment; Tree height; Urban trees","allometry; biometry; canopy architecture; diameter; ecosystem service; forest management; knowledge; tree; urban area; urban forestry; United Kingdom"

Recent studies suggest that altered intrauterine brain hemodynamics may explain these findings. Our objectives were to evaluate the pattern of head growth in a large cohort of fetuses with various types of CHD, analyze these patterns according to the type of CHD and estimate the effect of cerebral hemodynamics with advancing gestation in the second and third trimesters. Methods: Singleton fetuses with an isolated CHD were selected from three fetal medicine units (n = 436). Cases with placental insufficiency or genetic syndromes were excluded. CHD types were clustered according to the flow and oxygen saturation in the aorta. Z-scores of biometric data were constructed using growth charts of a normal population. HC at different gestational ages was evaluated and univariate and multivariate mixed regression analyses were performed to examine the patterns of prenatal HC growth. Results: Fetuses with severe and less severe types of CHD demonstrated statistically significant HC growth restriction with increasing gestational age (slope of −0.017/day); however, there was no statistically significant effect of fetal hemodynamics on HC growth. Fetuses with CHD but normal brain oxygenation and normal aortic flow showed a significant decrease in HC growth (slope of −0.024/day). Only fetuses with isolated tetralogy of Fallot demonstrated a smaller HC z-score at 20 weeks of gestation (−0.67 (95% CI, −1.16 to −0.18)). Conclusions: Despite the decline in head growth in fetuses with a prenatally detected isolated CHD, HC values were within the normal range, raising the question of its clinical significance. Furthermore, in contrast to other studies, this large cohort did not establish a significant correlation between aortic flow or oxygen saturation and HC growth. Factors other than altered fetal cerebral hemodynamics may contribute to HC growth restriction with increasing gestational age, such as (epi)genetic or placental factors. Copyright © 2016 ISUOG.

PE was calculated as predicted refraction minus actual postoperative refraction, and absolute PE as absolute difference independent of the sign, (APE)=predicted refraction minus actual postoperative refraction. This was done for each formula using manufacturer's and personalized lens constant. Further, PE and APE were evaluated according to axial length (AL).ResultsMean age of children was 2.97 years. About 66/117 eyes (56.4%) were below 2 years of age. Using Holladay 2, Holladay 1, Hoffer Q, and SRK/T formulae with manufacturer's lens constant, mean PE was 0.36, 0.41, 0.69, and 0.28 diopter (D), respectively. With personalized lens constant, it was 0.16, 0.15, 0.50, and -0.12 D, respectively. Difference in mean PE between the formulae was statistically significant (P<0.0001). SRK/T and Holladay 2 formulae had the least PE, both with manufacturer's and personalized constant. For eyes with AL<20 mm, SRK/T and Holladay 2 formulae gave the least PE. Personalizing the lens constant led to a decrease in mean PE in all formulae, except the Hoffer Q formula. However, personalizing the lens constant did not significantly improve the APE. At least 21% eyes had an APE of >2 D with all formulae, even with personalized lens constants.ConclusionIn pediatric eyes, SRK/T and the Holladay 2 formulae had the least PE. Personalizing the lens formula constant did reduce the PE significantly for all formulae except Hoffer Q.

The current study used two approaches, the comparison of siblings and bivariate biometric modeling, to reduce familial confounding and examine genetic and environmental influences on associations between fussiness in the first 2 years of life and ASB in childhood and late adolescence. Analyses were conducted on data from a prospective cohort (9237 at 4–9 years and 7034 at 14–17 years) who are the offspring of a nationally representative sample of US women. In the full sample, fussiness predicted both child and adolescent ASB to small but significant extents, controlling for a wide range of measured child and family-level covariates. When siblings who differed in their fussiness were compared, fussiness predicted ASB in childhood, but not ASB during adolescence. Furthermore, results from a bivariate Cholesky model suggested that even the association of fussiness with childhood ASB found when comparing siblings is attributable to familial factors. That is, although families with infants who are higher in fussiness also tend to have children and adolescents who engage in greater ASB, the hypothesis that infant fussiness has an environmentally mediated impact on the development of future ASB was not strongly supported. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Conduct problems; Delinquency; Fussiness; Irritability; Quasiexperimental; Sibling comparison; Temperament","adolescence; adolescent; antisocial behavior; child; childhood; clinical study; family study; female; genetic model; human; human tissue; infant; model; progeny; sibling; social behavior; temperament; antisocial personality disorder; biometry; demography; genetic association study; genetics; genotype environment interaction; longitudinal study; male; physiology; regression analysis; temperament; young adult; Adolescent; Antisocial Personality Disorder; Biometry; Child; Demography; Female; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genetic Association Studies; Humans; Infant; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Regression Analysis; Siblings; Temperament; Young Adult"

Atrazine catabolic genes and atrazine-degrading bacteria in the soil samples were analyzed by molecular methods. Materials and methods: Biomineralization of atrazine was measured in soil samples with a [U-ring-14C]-atrazine biometer technique in soil samples. Enrichment cultures growing with atrazine were derived from soil samples and they were analyzed for bacterial diversity by constructing 16S rDNA clone libraries and sequencing. Bacterial isolates were also obtained and they were screened for atrazine catabolic genes. Results and discussion: The soils contained active atrazine-metabolizing microbial communities and both aerobic and anaerobic biomineralization of [U-ring-14C]-atrazine to 14CO2 was demonstrated. In contrast to aerobic incubations, anaerobic biometers displayed considerable differences in the kinetics of atrazine mineralization between duplicates. Sequence analysis of 16S rDNA clone libraries constructed from the enrichment cultures revealed a preponderance of Variovorax spp. (51 %) and Schlesneria (16 %). Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences from pure cultures (n = 12) isolated from enrichment cultures yielded almost exclusively Arthrobacter spp. (83 %; 10/12 isolates). PCR screening of pure culture isolates for atrazine catabolic genes detected atzB, atzC, trzD, trzN, and possibly atzA. The presence of a complete metabolic pathway was not demonstrated by the amplification of catabolic genes among these isolates. Conclusions: The soils contained active atrazine-metabolizing microbial communities. The anaerobic biometer data showed variable response of atrazine biomineralization to external electron acceptor conditions. Partial pathways are inevitable in soil microbial communities, with metabolites linking into other catabolic and assimilative pathways of carbon and nitrogen. There was no evidence for the complete set of functional genes of the known pathways of atrazine biomineralization among the isolates. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Arthrobacter spp; Atz and trz genes; Biodegradation of atrazine; Herbicide biodegradation; Pesticide biodegradation","anoxic conditions; atrazine; bacterium; biodegradation; biometry; biomineralization; catabolism; electron; gene expression; genetic analysis; microbial community; oxic conditions; pesticide; RNA; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; species diversity; Arthrobacter; Bacteria (microorganisms); Variovorax"

According to results, five parasite species were identified in whole body of pikes including Eustrongylides exises, Raphidascaris acus and Triaeophorus crassus in intestine, Tetraonchus monenteron in gill and Diplostomum spathaceum in eye. The highest values of quantitative indices of parasite population [i.e. incidence percent (86.66 %), mean intensity (60.83 ± 39.92), mean abundance (58.14 ± 34.6) and abundance range (1–232)] were recorded for T. monenteron in all three sampling regions. The lowest values of these quantitative indices were found for D. spathaceum, E. exises and Tetraonchus crassus in Anzali wetland, Chamkhale River and Amirkelayeh wetland respectively. In 2, 3 and 4 years old pikes, T. monenteron had the highest values of quantitative indices of parasite population.

Methods The present study analyzed the total phenolic and antioxidant activity of the juices in different storage conditions. The biometry and biochemical parameters were evaluated in four experimental groups: normal control (AIN-93M), obese control (HFD), a group with obese rats plus control Ubá mango juice (MHFD), and another with enriched Ubá mango juice (HMHFD). Also, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-10 (IL-10), as well as histomorphology of the epididymal adipose tissue were determined. Results Ubá mango juices were found to have a high content of phenolic compounds and high antioxidant activity with no change due to storage time. HFD promoted the highest weight gain per gram of diet intake due to caloric density, and mango juices reversed the HFD effect; the weight gain, visceral fat, body mass index, and adiposity were similar to AIN-93M. MHFD and HMHFD showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by increasing HDL-cholesterol fraction and PPAR-γ, LPL, and decreasing blood glucose, total cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ATF), and FAS and TNF-α. Additionally, the epididymal adipose tissue histology confirmed the effect of the juice to reduce adipocyte hypertrophy.

Brain waves (electroencephalograms, EEG) can provide conscious, continuous human authentication for the proposed system. The advantage of brainwave biometry is that it is nearly impossible to forge or duplicate as the neuronal activity of people are distinctive even when they think about the same thing. Aim. We propose exploiting the brain as a biometric physical unclonable function (PUF). A user's EEG signals can be used to generate a unique and repeatable key that is resistant to cryptanalysis and eavesdropping, even against an adversary who obtains all the information regarding the system. Another objective is to implement a simplistic approach of cancelable biometrics by altering one's thoughts. Method. Features for the first step, Subject Authentication, are obtained from each task using the energy bands obtained from discrete Fourier transform and discrete wavelet transform. The second step constituting the Neurokey generation involves feature selection using normalized thresholds and segmentation window protocol. Results. We applied our methods to two datasets, the first based on five mental activities by seven subjects (325 samples) and the second based on three visually evoked tasks by 120 subjects (10,861 samples). These datasets were used to analyze the key generation process because they varied in the nature of data acquisition, environment, and activities. We determined the feasibility of our system using a smaller dataset first. We obtained a mean subject classification of 98.46% and 91.05% for Dataset I and Dataset II respectively. After an appropriate choice of features, the mean half total error rate for generating Neurokeys was 3.05% for Dataset I and 4.53% for Dataset II, averaged over the subjects, tasks, and electrodes. A unique key was established for each subject and task, and the error rates were analyzed for the Neurokey generation protocol. NIST statistical suite of randomness tests were applied on all the sequences obtained from the Neurokey generation process. Conclusions. A consistent, unique key for each subject can be obtained using EEG signals by collecting data from distinguishable cognitive activities. Moreover, the Neurokey can be changed easily by performing a different cognitive task, providing a means to change the biometrics in case of a compromise (cancelable). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Authentication; Biometrics; Cryptographic keys; Cryptography; Electroencephalograms; Key generation; Security","Authentication; Bioelectric phenomena; Biometrics; Classification (of information); Cryptography; Data acquisition; Discrete Fourier transforms; Discrete wavelet transforms; Public key cryptography; Wavelet transforms; Cancelable biometrics; Cognitive activities; Cryptographic key; Key generation; Key generation process; Physical unclonable functions (PUF); Security; Subject classification; Electroencephalography"

This study evaluates the device-independent Iowa Reference Algorithms (Iowa Institute for Biomedical Imaging) for automated intra-retinal layer segmentation and image scaling for three OCT systems. Healthy participants (n = 25) underwent macularvolume scans using a Cirrus HD-OCT (Zeiss), 3D-OCT 1000 (Topcon), and a non-commercial long-wavelength (1040nm) OCT on two occasions. Mean thickness of 10 intra-retinal layers was measured in three ETDRSsubfields (fovea, inner ring and outer ring) using the Iowa Reference Algorithms. Where available, total retinal thicknesses were measured using on-board software. Measured axial eye length (AEL)-dependent scaling was used throughout, with a comparison made to the system-specific fixed-AEL scaling. Inter-session repeatability and agreement between OCT systems and segmentation methods was assessed. Inter-session coefficient of repeatability (CoR) for the foveal subfield total retinal thickness was 3.43pm, 4.76pm, and 5.98pm for the Zeiss, Topcon, and long-wavelength images respectively. For the commercial software, CoR was 4.63pm (Zeiss) and 7.63pm (Topcon). The Iowa Reference Algorithms demonstrated higher repeatability than the on-board software and, in addition, reliably segmented all 10 intra-retinal layers. With fixed-AEL scaling, the algorithm produced significantly different thickness values for the three OCT devices (p<0.05), with these discrepancies generally characterized by an overall offset (bias) and correlations with axial eye length for the foveal subfield and outer ring (p<0.05). This correlation was reduced to an insignificant level in all cases when AEL-dependent scaling was used. Overall, the Iowa Reference Algorithms are viable for clinical and research use in healthy eyes imaged with these devices, however ocular biometry is required for accurate quantification of OCT images. © 2016 Terry et al.

Here, water samples were collected in the northern basin of the South China Sea (SCS) during summer 2014 in order to examine how environmental variability influenced species composition and cellular levels of calcite content. Average coccolithophore abundance and their calcite concentration in the water column were 11.82 cells mL-1 and 1508.3 pg C mL-1, respectively, during the cruise. Water samples can be divided into three floral groups according to their distinct coccolithophore communities. The vertical structure of the coccolithophore community in the water column was controlled by the trophic conditions, which were regulated by mesoscale eddies across the SCS basin. The evaluation of coccolithophore-based calcite in the surface ocean also showed that three key species in the SCS (Emiliania huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa oceanica, Florisphaera profunda) and other larger, numerically rare species made almost equal contributions to total coccolith-based calcite in the water column. For Emiliania huxleyi biometry measurements, coccolith size positively correlated with nutrients (nitrate, phosphate), and it is suggested that coccolith length is influenced by light and nutrients through the regulation of growth rates. Larger-sized coccoliths were also linked statistically to low pH and calcite saturation states; however, it is not a simple cause and effect relationship, as carbonate chemistry was strongly co-correlated with the other key environmental factors (nutrients, light). 7copy; 2016 Author(s).",,"Emiliania huxleyi; Gephyrocapsa oceanica; Haptophyceae; Vindula arsinoe"

This study was designed to examine the role of the innate proinflammatory mediator toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in paraquat-induced cardiac contractile anomalies and the underlying mechanisms involved with a focus on autophagy, a conservative machinery governing protein and organelle degradation and recycling for cardiac homeostasis. Wild-type (WT) and TLR4 knockout (TLR4-/-) mice were challenged with paraquat (45 mg/kg, i.p.) for 48 h. Paraquat challenge did not affect mRNA levels of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 in WT mice nor did paraquat treatment alter TREM-1 levels. Paraquat challenge elicited cardiac mechanical defects including compromised cardiomyocyte contractile function, intracellular Ca2+ handling, and overt autophagy as manifested by increased LC3BII-to-LC3BI ratio, Atg5, Atg7 and p62 levels. Interestingly, TLR4 knockout significantly attenuated paraquat-induced cardiac contractile and intracellular Ca2+ derangement as well as alterations of autophagy markers. Paraquat-elicited changes in cardiac autophagy markers (LC3BII, LC3BII-to-LC3BI ratio and p62) were augmented by lysosomal inhibition using bafilomycin A1 in WT mice. TLR4 knockout significantly attenuated or negated paraquat-elicited increase in LC3BII, LC3BII-to-LC3BI ratio and p62 levels in the presence of lysosomal inhibition. In addition, paraquat challenge promoted phosphorylation of AMPK while suppressing the phosphorylation of mTOR and ULK1 (the autophagy inhibitory Ser757), the effects of which were significantly attenuated by TLR4 ablation. In vitro study revealed that AMPK activation using AICAR or mTOR inhibition using rapamycin effectively negated the beneficial cardiomyocyte mechanical effects of TLR4 inhibition (CLI-095) against paraquat toxicity, supporting a permissive role for AMPK-mTOR in TLR4 inhibition-offered cardioprotection against paraquat. Our results suggested that TLR4 knockout alleviated paraquat-induced cardiac dysfunction possibly through regulation of AMPK-mediated cardiac autophagy. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Autophagy; Cardiomyocyte; Contraction; Paraquat; TLR4","mammalian target of rapamycin; messenger RNA; paraquat; rapamycin; toll like receptor 2; toll like receptor 4; toll like receptor 9; triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1; herbicide; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; mTOR protein, mouse; paraquat; serine threonine protein kinase ULK1; target of rapamycin kinase; Tlr4 protein, mouse; toll like receptor 4; Ulk1 protein, mouse; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; autophagy; biometry; blood pressure; calcium cell level; cardiac muscle cell; cell activity; controlled study; enzyme inhibition; heart disease; heart protection; homeostasis; in vitro study; lysosome; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein degradation; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; upregulation; animal; autophagy; calcium signaling; cardiac muscle cell; cardiotoxicity; deficiency; drug effects; genetics; genotype; heart contraction; Heart Diseases; knockout mouse; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; phenotype; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Autophagy; Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog; Calcium Signaling; Cardiotoxicity; Genotype; Heart Diseases; Herbicides; Mice, Knockout; Myocardial Contraction; Myocytes, Cardiac; Paraquat; Phenotype; Toll-Like Receptor 4; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"

Objective: This study was to measure the thickness of mGCC and disc-peripheral RNFL in early stage of primary glaucomous eyes by 3D-OCT and assess the anatomic basis of glaucoma-induced optical nerve damage. Methods: 3D-OCT images from 10 patients with advanced stage primary glaucoma in one lateral eye and early stage glaucoma in fellow eye from December 2010 to December 2012 were prospectively analyzed in China-Japan Friendship Hospital. The patients were diagnosed based on the recommended standard of National glaucoma group (1987 version) and received routine eye examination. 3D-OCT scanning was performed using 3D-macular mode, 3D-macular Wide mode and 3D-disc mode with TOPCON 3D-OCT 2000 system, and the images at macular 6 mm×6 mm area were analyzed. The posterior pole area was divided into 5 concentric rings from fovea toward periphery and equally subdivided into 100 small checks, with the area of 0.6 mm×0.6 mm for each. The probable values in each check were calculated as the ratio of each figure and corresponding normal value.The probable values were expressed as red color (P<1%), yellow color (P<5%) and gray color (P≥5%). Then the disc-periphery RNFL thickness and disc cup were evaluated. Results: No evident abnormality was found in the thicknesses of photoreceptors layer and bipolar cell layer in both advanced glaucomous eyes and the early stage of glaucomous eyes in the 10 patients. Serious damage of visual field was seen in the advanced glaucomous eyes and presented with red color in the parapapillary RNFL area, mGCC area and macular RNFL area, showing an evidently attenuation of the thicknesses of parapapillary RNFL, mGCC and RNFL. However, the visual field was close normal in the early stage glaucomous eyes, and mGCC and macular RNFL showed yellow color, while green or yellow color was exhibited in the parapapillary RNFL area, indicating mGCC and macular RNFL thickness was reduced, but parapapillar RNFL thickness was near normal. Conclusions: The change of mGCC thickness is earlier than that of peripheral RNFL at optic disc in primary glaucomaous eyes, which may imply that the disappear of macular ganglion cell body is earlier than that of the axon.

METHODS: This prospective study included 52 eyes of 45 patients diagnosed with cataract and indicated for phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation at the Faculty of Medicine of Mersin University. For each patient, preoperative corneal topography, autokeratometric measurements and biometric measurements were performed before and after pupil dilation. RESULTS: Kh (horizontal) values obtained through autokeratometry and anterior chamber depth measured by biometric ultrasonography were significantly greater when pupils were dilated compared with values obtained when pupils were undilated. Implanting IOLs with power calculated using measurements taken during pupillary dilation resulted in a significantly higher rate of emmetropia. Comparison of emmetropic eyes and ametropic eyes showed significantly larger anterior chamber depth in emmetropic eyes. CONCLUSION: Keratometric and biometric measurements are more important in IOL power calculation than the formula used. If biometric ultrasonography is performed using contact technique, care must be taken to avoid corneal compression. Anterior chamber depth should be followed during measurement, and the margin of error can be minimized by using the highest value obtained in IOL power calculation.

The estimated fetal weight (EFW) and abdominal circumference (AC) percentiles were tested as predictors of SGA at birth (<10‰).Results: 87 (12.2%) patients had an SGA baby. Patients with a second trimester EFW ≤25‰ were significantly more likely to have SGA at birth (24.2% versus 10.3%, p < 0.001). Similar results were seen for women with second trimester AC ≤25‰ (likelihood of SGA 21.9% versus 11.2%, p = 0.013). A second trimester EFW ≤25‰ was a better predictor of SGA at birth than a second trimester EFW ≤ 10‰ (Positive likelihood ratio 2.30 versus 2.09).

The nonlinear behaviour of the response was studied using the conditioned response techniques considering models of increasing complexity. Results showed that the cross-axis terms are comparable to the diagonal terms. The contribution of the nonlinear effects are minor and can be endorsed to the change of modal parameters during the tests. The nonlinearity generated by the vibration magnitude is more evident in the subject response, since magnitude-dependent effects in the population are overlaid by the scatter in the subjects’ biometric data. The biodynamic response is influenced by the addition of a secondary vibration axis and, in case of dual-axis vibrations, the overall magnitude has a marginal contribution.

No significant difference was observed between mean volumes of liquid (49.2 ± 68.9 μL: S. collinsi; 28.3 ± 59.8 μL: S. vanzolinii; 5 ± 7.1 μL: S. cassiquiarensis; and 0 μL: S. macrodon) and coagulated (65.4 ± 142.1 μL: S. collinsi; 125.8 ± 142.5 μL: S. vanzolinii; 175 ± 176.8 μL: S. cassiquiarensis; and 500 μL: S. macrodon) fractions within species or when each fraction was compared among the studied species. No correlation between testicular volume and seminal volume was observed when liquid (R = 0.31, S. collinsi; R = −0.69, S. vanzolinii) and coagulated (R = 0.32, S. collinsi; R = −0.37, S. vanzolinii) fractions were evaluated. No sufficient data were obtained for the other two species. Seminal quality was similar among species, and the most common defect was coiled tail. The method of electroejaculation yielded satisfactory results on these species, under field conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Electroejaculation; Saimiri; Sperm; Testicular biometry","anatomy and histology; animal; cell membrane; male; physiology; species difference; sperm; spermatozoon; spermatozoon motility; squirrel monkey; testis; Animals; Cell Membrane; Male; Saimiri; Semen; Species Specificity; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa; Testis"

In particular, we examine the representation of living above- and below-ground biomass change (net accumulation) using plot-level biometry and repeat airborne laser scanning (ALS) of three dimensional forest plot structure. These are compared with cumulative net CO2 fluxes (net ecosystem production, NEP) from eddy covariance (EC) over a six-year period within a jack pine chronosequence of four stands (~94, 30, 14 and 3 years since establishment from 2005) located in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Combining the results of the two methods yield valuable observations on the partitioning of C within ecosystems. Subtracting total living biomass C accumulation from NEP results in a residual that represents change in soil and litter C storage. When plotted against time for the stands investigated, the curve produced is analogous to the soil C dynamics described in Covington (1981). Here, ALS biomass accumulation exceeds EC-based NEP measured in young stands, with the residual declining with age as stands regenerate and litter decomposition stabilizes. During the 50-70 year age-period, NEP and live biomass accumulation come into balance, with the soil and litter pools of stands 70-100 years post-disturbance becoming a net store of C. Biomass accumulation was greater in 2008-2011 compared to 2005-2008, with the smallest increase in the 94-year-old ""old jack pine"" stand and greatest in the 14-year-old ""harvested jack pine 1994"" stand, with values of 1.4 (±3.2) tC ha-1 and 12.0 (±1.6) tC ha-1, respectively. The efficiency with which CO2 was stored in accumulated biomass was lowest in the youngest and oldest stands, but peaked during rapid regeneration following harvest (14-year-old stand). The analysis highlights that the primary source of uncertainty in the data integration workflow is in the calculation of biomass expansion factors, and this aspect of the workflow needs to be implemented with caution to avoid large error propagations. We suggest that the adoption of integrated ALS, in situ and atmospheric flux monitoring frameworks is needed to improve spatio-temporal partitioning of C balance components at sub-decadal scale within rapidly changing forest ecosystems and for use in national carbon accounting programs. © 2016 .","Airborne laser scanning; Boreal forest; Carbon balance; Change detection; Gross primary production (GPP); Jack pine chronosequence; Monitoring framework; Multi-temporal LiDAR; Net ecosystem production (NEP); Stand growth","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Data integration; Digital storage; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Laser applications; Reforestation; Scanning; Soils; Surface analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Airborne Laser scanning; Boreal forests; Carbon balance; Change detection; Chronosequences; Gross primary production; Monitoring frameworks; Multi-temporal; Net ecosystem production; Stand growth; C (programming language); airborne survey; biomass; biometry; boreal forest; carbon balance; carbon sequestration; chronosequence; coniferous tree; eddy covariance; growth rate; laser method; lidar; net ecosystem production; nutrient dynamics; Canada; Saskatchewan; Pinus banksiana"

We evaluated the effects of topical testosterone and estrogen in the hypospadic penis regarding biometric measures, side effects, and serum hormonal levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study using estradiol prior to hypospadias surgery. Patients and methods Sixty-nine children with hypospadias were randomly divided into three study groups: a control group (CG) of 17 children given placebo cream; a testosterone group (TG) of 28 children who used 1% testosterone propionate; and an estradiol group (EG) of 24 children using 0.01% estradiol. All subjects applied the topical ointment on the entire penis, twice daily for 30 days before surgical correction. Biometric evaluation of the penis included penile length and diameter, glans diameter, distance from the urethral meatus to the tip, and the width of the urethral plate. These measurements as well as serum hormone level, and side effects were evaluated prior to hormone use, and 30 and 90 days after. Results After 30 days an increase in penile diameter and length and diameter of the glans were observed in TG (p < 0.05). The width of the urethral plate and distance from meatus to the tip increased in TG, although not significantly. The most frequent side effects were appearance of pubic hair and darkening of the genital skin, mainly in TG, but these were transient and disappeared after 90 days of treatment. No significant variations were seen in serum hormonal levels (Table). Conclusion As in previous studies, an increase in penile length and diameter, and glans diameter was observed with the use of testosterone. Proximal urethral plate width and distance from the meatus to the tip of the penis had a tendency to increase also in TG. Estradiol did not change biometric measure of the penis. Few side effects occurred after both hormones, and any that did improved after 90 days follow-up and did not change hormone serum levels. Conclusion Preoperative use of topical testosterone increases penile size, diameter of the penis and glans. The use of estradiol does not change penile biometry. Side effects occur mainly with the use of testosterone and are transient. No significant and persistent hormonal changes were observed.

Studies on these populations report that the total genetic diversity is as high as that observed for other continental populations. On the other hand, eating habits are different between indigenous and urban population, as indigenous people still have traditional habits. Setting and sample population: The sample consisted of 106 indigenous subjects, in permanent dentition stage, belonging to four groups: Arara-Laranjal (n = 35), Arara-Iriri (n = 20), Xikrin-Kaiapó (n = 24), and Assurini (n = 27). Material and methods: Standardized facial photographs were obtained, and fourteen measurements were analyzed. Intra- and intergroup homogeneities were examined by discriminant analysis, followed by anova and Kruskal–Wallis tests. Sexual dimorphism to each village was analyzed by Student's t-test or Mann–Whitney test, at p < 0.05. Results: Significant facial differences were found between male and female, indicating that sex data should not be grouped for intergroup comparison. Discriminant analysis showed a large intergroup heterogeneity, while an intragroup homogeneity was found, especially for females. It was also observed that some morphological features of the face are specific to some villages, regardless of ethnicity. Conclusions: Facial morphological characteristics were strongly different among groups, even comparing villages from the same ethnicity. Furthermore, a low diversity within groups was observed. Our findings, supported by previous reports on genetics and eating habits in these populations, reinforce the role of the genetic determination on craniofacial morphology. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Intrauterine growth restriction can be associated with various causes, among which is low uteroplacental perfusion and chronic hypoxia during gestation. Often, intrauterine growth-restricted fetuses have increased oxidative stress; therefore, agents that decrease oxidative stress and increase utero, placental, and umbilical perfusion have been proposed as a beneficial therapeutic strategy. In this scenario, melatonin acts as an umbilical vasodilator and a potent antioxidant that has not been evaluated in pregnancies under chronic hypoxia that induce fetal growth restriction. However, this neurohormone has been proposed as a pharmacologic therapy for complicated pregnancies. Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the effects of prenatal administration of melatonin during the last trimester of pregnancy on the biometry of the growth-restricted lambs because of developmental hypoxia. Further, we aimed to determine melatonin and cortisol levels and oxidative stress markers in plasma of pregnant ewes during the treatment. Study Design High-altitude pregnant sheep received either vehicle (n = 5; 5 mL 1.4% ethanol) or melatonin (n = 7; 10 mg/kg–1day–1 in 5 mL 1.4% ethanol) daily during the last one-third of gestation. Maternal plasma levels of melatonin, cortisol, antioxidant capacity, and oxidative stress were determined along treatment. At birth, neonates were examined, weighed, and measured (biparietal diameter, abdominal diameter, and crown-rump length). Results Antenatal treatment with melatonin markedly decreased neonatal biometry and weight at birth. Additionally, melatonin treatment increased the length of gestation by 7.5% and shifted the time of delivery. Furthermore, the prenatal treatment doubled plasma levels of melatonin and cortisol and significantly improved the antioxidant capacity of the pregnant ewes. Conclusions Our findings indicate that antenatal melatonin induces further intrauterine growth restriction but improves the maternal plasma antioxidant capacity. Additional studies should address the efficiency and safety of antenatal melatonin before clinical attempts on humans. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","gestation; hypoxia; intrauterine growth restriction; melatonin; neonatal biometry; oxidative stress","8 isoprostane; alcohol; hydrocortisone; melatonin; biological marker; hydrocortisone; melatonin; adverse drug reaction; altitude; animal experiment; animal model; antioxidant activity; Article; biometry; biparietal distance; birth weight; controlled study; crown rump length; domestic sheep; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; gestation period; hormone blood level; hydrocortisone blood level; hypoxia; intrauterine growth retardation; male; maternal plasma; newborn; nonhuman; obstetric delivery; ovine model; oxidative stress; prenatal care; priority journal; prostaglandin blood level; sagittal abdominal diameter; third trimester pregnancy; animal; blood; chemically induced; drug effects; Fetal Growth Retardation; fetus development; gestational age; physiology; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; sheep; Animals; Biomarkers; Birth Weight; Female; Fetal Development; Fetal Growth Retardation; Gestational Age; Hydrocortisone; Melatonin; Oxidative Stress; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Sheep"

The contributory factors included: transcription errors (n=26); wrong patient biometry (n=21); wrong IOL selection (n=16); changes in planned procedure (n=16); incorrect IOL brought into theatre (n=11); left/right eye selection errors (n=9); communication errors (n=9); and positive/negative IOL power errors (n=9). In 44 PSIs, no causal factor was reported, limiting the learning value of such reports. Compared with the data from previous years, biometry errors were much reduced but IOL transcription and documentation errors were greater, particularly if further checks did not refer to the original source documentation. IOL exchange surgery was reported in 45 cases.ConclusionsThe selection and implantation of the correct IOL is a complex process which is not adequately addressed by existing checking procedures. Despite the introduction of surgical checklists, wrong IOL incidents continue to occur and are probably under-reported. Human or behavioural factors are heavily implicated in these errors and need to be addressed by novel approaches, including simulation training.

Increase of metallic concentrations in aquatic environments represents a potential risk to exposed organisms, including fish. The aim of this study was to characterize the environmental risk to fish health linked to a polymetallic contamination from former uranium mines in France. This contamination is characterized by metals naturally present in the areas (manganese and iron), uranium, and metals (aluminum and barium) added to precipitate uranium and its decay products. Effects from mine releases in two contaminated ponds (Pontabrier for Haute-Vienne Department and Saint-Pierre for Cantal Department) were compared to those assessed at four other ponds outside the influence of mine tailings (two reference ponds/department). In this way, 360 adult three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were caged for 28 days in these six ponds before biomarker analyses (immune system, antioxidant system, biometry, histology, DNA integrity, etc.). Ponds receiving uranium mine tailings presented higher concentrations of uranium, manganese and aluminum, especially for the Haute-Vienne Department. This uranium contamination could explain the higher bioaccumulation of this metal in fish caged in Pontabrier and Saint-Pierre Ponds.

Few studies have evaluated the effect of malaria on intrauterine growth restriction on the basis of the fetal growth rate, rather than just the small-for-gestational age z score. Here, we assessed the impact of malaria on IUGR, using data from a longitudinal, ultrasonography-based follow-up study of Beninese women. Methods. A total of 1016 women were followed up from gestational week 17 to delivery. Malaria was detected every month. Women underwent ultrasonography 4 times for gestational age determination and fetal biometry. We assessed the effect of malaria on birth weight-for-gestational age z score (n = 735 women) and fetal growth velocity (n = 664), defined as a change in fetal weight z score over time. Results. Malaria was detected in 43% of women. Fetal growth velocity was negative overall, decreasing further at the end of the third trimester. Women with ≥2 malarial parasite infections tended to have lower z scores than uninfected women. Malaria both in early and late pregnancy was associated with a reduction in fetal growth velocity, which occurred either immediately or with a delay after infection. Discussions. We confirmed the deleterious effect of malaria during both early and late pregnancy on fetal growth. This stresses the importance of starting preventive measures against malaria as early as possible during pregnancy. © 2016 The Author.","Africa; epidemiology; fetal growth restriction; malaria; pregnancy","adult; Article; Benin; biometry; birth weight; echography; female; fetus; fetus growth; fetus weight; follow up; gestational age; growth rate; human; intrauterine growth retardation; longitudinal study; major clinical study; malaria; nonhuman; obstetric delivery; pregnancy; priority journal; prospective study; adolescent; complication; diagnostic imaging; Fetal Growth Retardation; malaria; male; newborn; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Benin; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Fetus; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Longitudinal Studies; Malaria; Male; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Prospective Studies; Ultrasonography; Young Adult"

This contributes to the indiscriminate use of antimicrobial drugs and poor treatment outcomes. The aim of this comprehensive review was to summarize the diagnostic performance of host biomarkers capable of differentiating bacterial from non-bacterial infections to guide the use of antibiotics. Methods: Online databases of published literature were searched from January 2010 through April 2015. English language studies that evaluated the performance of one or more host biomarker in differentiating bacterial from non-bacterial infection in patients were included. Key information extracted included author information, study methods, population, pathogens, clinical information, and biomarker performance data. Study quality was assessed using a combination of validated criteria from the QUADAS and Lijmer checklists. Biomarkers were categorized as hematologic factors, inflammatory molecules, cytokines, cell surface or metabolic markers, other host biomarkers, host transcripts, clinical biometrics, and combinations of markers. Findings: Of the 193 citations identified, 59 studies that evaluated over 112 host biomarkers were selected. Most studies involved patient populations from high-income countries, while 19% involved populations from low- and middle-income countries. The most frequently evaluated host biomarkers were C-reactive protein (61%), white blood cell count (44%) and procalcitonin (34%). Study quality scores ranged from 23.1% to 92.3%. There were 9 high performance host biomarkers or combinations, with sensitivity and specificity of ≥85% or either sensitivity or specificity was reported to be 100%. Five host biomarkers were considered weak markers as they lacked statistically significant performance in discriminating between bacterial and non-bacterial infections. Discussion: This manuscript provides a summary of host biomarkers to differentiate bacterial from non-bacterial infections in patients with acute febrile illness. Findings provide a basis for prioritizing efforts for further research, assay development and eventual commercialization of rapid point-of-care tests to guide use of antimicrobials. This review also highlights gaps in current knowledge that should be addressed to further improve management of febrile patients. © 2016 Kapasi et al.

The neuromodulator dopamine (DA) has been implicated in the prevention of excessive ocular elongation and myopia in various animal models. This study used retinaspecific DA knockout mice to investigate the role of retinal DA in refractive development and susceptibility to experimental myopia. METHODS. Measurements of refractive error, corneal curvature, and ocular biometrics were obtained as a function of age for both untreated and form-deprived (FD) groups of retinaspecific tyrosine hydroxylase knockout (rTHKO) and control (Ctrl) mice. Retinas from each group were analyzed by HPLC for levels of DA and its primary metabolite (DOPAC). RESULTS. Under normal visual conditions, rTHKO mice showed significantly myopic refractions (F(1,188) = 7.602, P < 0.001) and steeper corneas (main effect of genotype F(1,180) = 5.1, P < 0.01) at 4 and 6 weeks of age compared with Ctrl mice. Retina-specific THKO mice also had thinner corneas (main effect of genotype F(1,181) = 37.17, P < 0.001), thinner retinas (F(6,181) = 6.07, P < 0.001), and shorter axial lengths (F(6,181) = 3.78, P < 0.01) than Ctrl mice. Retina-specific THKO retinas contained less than 15% of DA and DOPAC compared with Ctrl retinas, and the remaining DA had a significantly higher turnover, as indicated by DOPAC/DA ratios (Student’s t-test, P < 0.05). Retina-specific THKO mice showed similar, yet more variable, responses to 6 weeks of FD compared with Ctrl mice. CONCLUSIONS. Diminished retinal DA induced spontaneous myopia in mice raised under laboratory conditions without form deprivation. The relative myopic shift in rTHKO mice may be explained by steeper corneas, an unexpected finding. The chronic loss of DA did not significantly alter the FD myopia response in rTHKO mice. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

Electronic medical records, including preoperative biometric variables (keratometric diopter, axial length, anterior chamber depth, and lens thickness), the refractive change (RC), and the absolute value of refractive change (ARC) were reviewed.RESULTS: In the control and OAG patients, the anterior chamber depth was negatively correlated with the ARC (r = -0.344, p = 0.043 and r = -0.431, p = 0.006, respectively), whereas there was no correlation in the ACG patients. Lens thickness was positively correlated with the RC, but not with the ARC, in the control and OAG groups (r = 0.391, p = 0.020 and r = 0.501, p = 0.001, respectively). In contrast, lens thickness in the ACG group was not correlated with the RC but was positively correlated with the ARC (r = 0.331, p = 0.032).CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with the anterior chamber depth, preoperatively measured lens thickness may be a useful predictor of the direction of the RC after cataract surgery in control and OAG patients. However, in ACG patients, a thicker lens was correlated with a larger RC, regardless of the direction of the shift (hyperopic or myopic).","Absolute value of the refractive change; Angle-closure glaucoma; Anterior chamber depth; Lens thickness; Refractive change","aged; anterior eye chamber; biometry; complication; diagnostic imaging; eye refraction; female; follow up; Glaucoma, Angle-Closure; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; human; intraocular pressure; male; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; phacoemulsification; physiology; procedures; retrospective study; Aged; Anterior Chamber; Biometry; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glaucoma, Angle-Closure; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Male; Middle Aged; Phacoemulsification; Refraction, Ocular; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, Optical Coherence"

Kidney metal concentrations increased with a rise of temperature. The biometric indices analysed (Fulton condition factor, pyloric cæca, hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indices) generally decreased with an increase of temperature but not with metal contamination. At the enzymatic level, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), involved in antioxidant response, was affected by both temperature and metal contamination, whereas the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), involved in energy accumulation but also in antioxidant response, was only affected by metal exposure. The response of perch to the stressors at the transcriptional level differed from the metabolic response. In particular, the transcription level of the cco and g6pdh genes sharply decreased with increasing temperature, while the activities of the corresponding enzymes remained stable. The normal response of the transcription level of the apoptotic gene (diablo) to heat stress was also altered in metal-contaminated fish. The combination of metal and temperature stresses also modified the response of antioxidant metabolism induced by these stressors individually. This study contributes to a better understanding of the influences of natural stressors like temperature on biomarkers commonly used in ecotoxicological studies and will facilitate their interpretation in the context of multiple stressors characteristic of field situations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biometric condition indicators; Cadmium; Fish; Gene transcription level; Metabolic capacities; Metals; Nickel; Oxidative stress; Perca flavescens; Temperature; Yellow perch","cadmium; cytochrome c oxidase; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; nickel; second mitochondrial activator of caspase; superoxide dismutase; antioxidant; biological marker; cadmium; nickel; transcriptome; water pollutant; antioxidant; biometry; cadmium; enzyme activity; gene expression; metabolism; nickel; perciform; pollution effect; temperature effect; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; cco gene; chemical interaction; controlled study; diablo gene; energy; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; enzyme activity; fish genetics; g6pdh gene; genetic transcription; heat stress; nonhuman; Perca flavescens; priority journal; sod gene; temperature sensitivity; transcriptomics; adverse effects; animal; drug effects; heat; kidney; liver; metabolism; perch; physiological stress; physiology; toxicity; toxicity testing; water pollutant; Perca; Perca flavescens; Animals; Antioxidants; Biomarkers; Cadmium; Hot Temperature; Kidney; Liver; Nickel; Perches; Stress, Physiological; Toxicity Tests; Transcriptome; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

A key challenge in this sub-discipline is establishing how important the contribution of evolutionary and ecological processes and their interactions are to observed shifts in population and community characteristics. Although a variety of metrics to separate and quantify the effects of evolutionary and ecological contributions to observed trait changes have been used, they often allocate fractions of observed changes to ecology and evolution in different ways. We used a mathematical and numerical comparison of two commonly used frameworks – the Price equation and reaction norms – to reveal that the Price equation cannot partition genetic from non-genetic trait change within lineages, whereas the reaction norm approach cannot partition among- from within-lineage trait change. We developed a new metric that combines the strengths of both Price-based and reaction norm metrics, extended all metrics to analyse community change and also incorporated extinction and colonisation of species in these metrics. Depending on whether our new metric is applied to populations or communities, it can correctly separate intraspecific, interspecific, evolutionary, non-evolutionary and interacting eco-evolutionary contributions to trait change. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.","Community ecology; eco-evolutionary dynamics; eco-evolutionary partitioning metrics; norms of reaction; Price equation; trait change","biometry; colonization; community ecology; equation; evolutionary biology; evolutionary theory; extinction; interspecific interaction; intraspecific interaction; population dynamics; reaction norm; resource allocation"

The effects of shape description methods (shape indices, Procrustes analysis and elliptical Fourier analysis) on classification performance were evaluated. Procrustes analysis and elliptical Fourier analysis perform better than shape indices when single view is considered, but all perform equally well with combined views.

The inclusion of fish oil as main source of n-3 LC-PUFA in aquafeeds is mostly limited by the increasing price and decreasing availability. Fish oil replacement with cheaper terrestrial plant and animal oils has considerably reduced the content of n-3 LC-PUFA in flesh of farmed Atlantic salmon. Novel DHA-enriched oils with high alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) content will be available from transgenic oilseeds plants in the near future as an alternative for dietary fish oil replacement in aquafeeds. As a preliminary validation, we formulated an oil blend (TOFX) with high DHA and ALA content using tuna oil (TO) high in DHA and the flaxseed oil (FX) high in ALA, and assessed its ability to achieve fish oil-like n-3 LC-PUFA tissue composition in Atlantic salmon smolts. We applied proteomics as an exploratory approach to understand the effects of nutritional changes on the fish liver. Comparisons were made between fish fed a fish oil-based diet (FO) and a commercial-like oil blend diet (fish oil + poultry oil, FOPO) over 89 days. Growth and feed efficiency ratio were lower on the TOFX diet. Fish muscle concentration of n-3 LC-PUFA was significantly higher for TOFX than for FOPO fish, but not higher than for FO fish, while retention efficiency of n-3 LC-PUFA was promoted by TOFX relative to FO. Proteomics analysis revealed an oxidative stress response indicative of the main adaptive physiological mechanism in TOFX fish. While specific dietary fatty acid concentrations and balances and antioxidant supplementation may need further attention, the use of an oil with a high content of DHA and ALA can enhance tissue deposition of n-3 LC-PUFA in relation to a commercially used oil blend. © 2016 Nuez-Ortín et al.

Methods Baseline and six monthly data were retrieved from 78 subjects (aged 7–10 years, with myopia ≤ 4.00 D and astigmatism ≤ 1.25 D) who had completed a two-year randomized clinical trial using ortho-k for myopia control. They were randomly assigned to wear ortho-k lenses or single-vision spectacles (control). Anterior segment parameters were measured with the Pentacam after cycloplegia. Results No significant changes in CLT and ASL over time were observed in either group of subjects (37 ortho-k; 38 control). In the control group, CCT remained unchanged during the study period but in the ortho-k group, it was significantly reduced by an average of 0.009 mm by the 6-month visit (p < 0.001) and remained unchanged thereafter. No significant changes in ACD was found in the ortho-k group but it was significantly increased by an average of 0.04 mm (p = 0.001) in the control group. Conclusion CLT nor ASL did not change over time in either control or ortho-k subjects. Although ACD significantly increased in the control subjects and CCT significantly reduced in the first six months of ortho-k lens wear, these changes were small and did not affect the overall ASL. © 2016 British Contact Lens Association","Anterior chamber depth; Anterior segment length; Myopia control; Orthokeratology","analysis of variance; anterior eye chamber depth; anterior eye segment; anterior segment length; Article; astigmatism; biometry; central corneal thickness; child; controlled study; crystalline lens thickness; female; human; long term care; major clinical study; male; myopia; orthokeratology lens; priority journal; refraction error; school child; spectacles; visual system parameters; aging; anterior eye segment; devices; longitudinal study; myopia; orthokeratology lens; pathology; procedures; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; Aging; Anterior Eye Segment; Child; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Myopia; Orthokeratologic Procedures; Treatment Outcome"

Design: The design is retrospective data analysis. Participants: There are a total of 55 eyes of 55 patients with OAG who had a cataract surgery alone or in combination with trabeculectomy. Methods: We classified OAG subjects into the following groups based on surgical history: only cataract surgery (OC group), cataract surgery after prior trabeculectomy (CAT group), and cataract surgery performed in combination with trabeculectomy (CCT group). Main Outcome Measures: Differences between actual and predicted postoperative refractive error. Results: Mean error (ME, difference between postoperative and predicted SE) in the CCT group was significantly lower (towards myopia) than that of the OC group (P = 0.008). Additionally, mean absolute error (MAE, absolute value of ME) in the CAT group was significantly greater than in the OC group (P = 0.006). Using linear mixed models, the ME calculated with the SRK II formula was more accurate than the ME predicted by the SRK T formula in the CAT (P = 0.032) and CCT (P = 0.035) groups. Conclusions: The intraocular lens power prediction accuracy was lower in the CAT and CCT groups than in the OC group. The prediction error was greater in the CAT group than in the OC group, and the direction of the prediction error tended to be towards myopia in the CCT group. The SRK II formula may be more accurate in predicting residual refractive error in the CAT and CCT groups. © 2016 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists","cataract surgery; combined surgery; open-angle glaucoma; power prediction; trabeculectomy","aged; anatomy and histology; biometry; eye axis length; female; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; human; intraocular pressure; lens implant; lens implantation; male; middle aged; optics; phacoemulsification; physiology; postoperative complication; Refractive Errors; reproducibility; retrospective study; standards; trabeculectomy; very elderly; visual acuity; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Axial Length, Eye; Biometry; Female; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Lens Implantation, Intraocular; Lenses, Intraocular; Male; Middle Aged; Optics and Photonics; Phacoemulsification; Postoperative Complications; Refractive Errors; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Trabeculectomy; Visual Acuity"

By analysing the correspondence Leonard Darwin maintained with Ronald Aylmer Fisher in conjunction with an assessment of his books and other written works between the 1910s and 1930s, this article argues for a more prominent role played by him than the previously recognised in the literature as an informal mentor of Fisher. The paper discusses Leonard’s efforts to amalgamate Mendelism with both Eugenics and Darwinism in order for the first to base their policies on new scientific developments and to help the second in finding a target for natural selection. Without a formal qualification in biological sciences and as such mistrusted by some “formal” scientists, Leonard Darwin engaged with key themes of Darwinism such as mimicry, the role of mutations on speciation and the process of genetic variability, arriving at important conclusions concerning the usefulness of Mendelian genetics for his father’s theory. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biometrics; Eugenics; Evolutionary theory; Genetics; Hugo De-Vries; Karl Pearson; Leonard Darwin; Mendelism; Mutationism; Ronald Aylmer Fisher","biometry; evolution; genetic selection; genetics; history; medical genetics; mentor; mutation; United Kingdom; writing; Biological Evolution; Biometry; Correspondence as Topic; Eugenics; Genetics; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Mentors; Mutation; Selection, Genetic; United Kingdom"

Methods: From 3 to 21 weeks of age, macaques were reared with binocular dual-focus spectacles. The treatment lenses had central 2-mm zones of zero-power and concentric annular zones that had alternating powers of either +3.0 diopters (D) and 0 D (+3 D/pL) or −3.0 D and 0 D (−3 D/pL). The relative widths of the powered and plano zones varied from 50:50 to 18:82 between treatment groups. Refractive status, corneal curvature, and axial dimensions were assessed biweekly throughout the lens-rearing period. Comparison data were obtained from monkeys reared with binocular full-field single-vision lenses (FF+3D, n = 6; FF−3D, n = 10) and from 35 normal controls. Results: The median refractive errors for all of the +3 D/pL lens groups were similar to that for the FF+3D group (+4.63 D versus +4.31 D to +5.25 D; P = 0.18–0.96), but significantly more hyperopic than that for controls (+2.44 D; P = 0.0002–0.003). In the −3 D/pL monkeys, refractive development was dominated by the zero-powered portions of the treatment lenses; the −3 D/pL animals (+2.94 D to +3.13 D) were more hyperopic than the FF−3D monkeys (−0.78 D; P = 0.004–0.006), but similar to controls (+2.44 D; P = 0.14–0.22). Conclusions: The results demonstrate that even when the more positive-powered zones make up only one-fifth of a dual-focus lens' surface area, refractive development is still dominated by relative myopic defocus. Overall, the results emphasize that myopic defocus distributed across the visual field evokes strong signals to slow eye growth in primates. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

This systematic review examines studies reporting on the relationship between maternal depression, anxiety or stress during pregnancy and fetal growth measured during pregnancy using ultrasound biometry. A systematic search of PsycINFO, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase was conducted and 1575 records were identified, with nine studies meeting inclusion criteria gathering data from over 7000 participants. All studies measured depression, six examined anxiety and depression, and five examined all three exposures. The majority measured symptoms rather than clinically diagnosable disorder. Studies consistently reported significant associations between maternal mental health, particularly anxiety symptoms, and reduced fetal head growth. Other fetal growth parameters showed inconsistent findings. A number of studies suggest that cortisol dysregulation associated with maternal mental health may play a role in fetal growth restriction. However, heterogeneity in the timing of growth measurement, assessment measures used for mental health and inconsistencies in adjustment for confounders, limits the synthesis and interpretation of findings. Future studies should consider differences in the timing, intensity and duration of mental health symptoms over pregnancy and should employ diagnostic assessment of mental disorders. Fetal growth should be repeatedly measured and further work is needed to establish the biological mechanisms involved. © Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease 2016.","anxiety; depression; fetal growth; growth restriction; head circumference",

Transpiration and biomass production were studied on young sessile oak trees Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. regenerated as sprouts and seedlings, and grown in a coppice experimental site in the Czech Republic. Biomass production was estimated using destructive methods, while transpiration was derived from sap flow measurements and assessed according to the plant biometry and microclimatic conditions. Sprouts were characterized by a significantly higher diameter, height, leaf area and above-ground biomass and by a lower wood density as compared with seedlings of the same age. Moreover, the sap flow of sprouts was higher than that of seedlings, which was explained by the plant dimension. Transpiration, expressed as sap flow scaled to plant leaf area, did not differ between seedlings and sprouts when soil water was not limiting. However, during drought periods, when soil water potential dropped below -1.4 MPa, sprouts transpired significantly more than seedlings. Our results confirm that sprouts have access to a larger water pool via the old stump root system and are able to draw more water under drought. Moreover, sprouts seemed to be less susceptible to water limitations than seedlings of similar age. Less influence of drought on sprouts may partially explain their higher above-ground biomass production. Based on our results, coppice could be an appropriate management system to be adopted in sites characterized by frequent or extreme drought periods. © SISEF.","Biomass production; Coppice; Drought stress; Sap flow; Seedling; Sessile oak; Sprout; Transpiration",

Methods: A prospective study was performed for biometry measurements of 373 eyes of 192 healthy subjects using the IOLMaster at the outpatient department of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from February 2013 to July 2013. The axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), keratometry (K), and IOL power were measured before and after 1% tropicamide eye drop instillation. The Haigis formula was used in the IOL power calculation with the predicted target to emmetropia. Each parameter was compared by a paired t-test prior to and after pupillary dilation. Bland-Altman plots were also used to determine the agreement between each parameter. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 53.74±14.41 years (range 18-93 years).

Methods: We studied 149 consecutive patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. The presence of CVH was evaluated using indocyanine green angiography. Subfoveal choroidal thickness and axial length were measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography and optical biometry, respectively. Genotyping of three single nubleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) A69S (rs10490924), complement factor H (CFH) I62V (rs800292), and CFH (rs1329428), which are reportedly associated with central serous chorioretinopathy, was conducted using TaqMan technology.

Epidemiological studies in humans and animal experiments using rodent models indicate that gestational exposure to airborne pollution, in particular diesel engine exhaust (DE), reduces birth weight, but effects depend on exposure duration, gestational window and nanoparticle (NP) concentration. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of gestational exposure to diluted DE on feto-placental development in a rabbit model. Pregnant females were exposed to diluted (1 mg/m3), filtered DE (NP diameter ≈ 69 nm) or clean air (controls) for 2 h/day, 5 days/week by nose-only exposure (total exposure: 20 days in a 31-day gestation). Results: DE exposure induced early signs of growth retardation at mid gestation with decreased head length (p = 0.04) and umbilical pulse (p = 0.018). Near term, fetal head length (p = 0.029) and plasma insulin and IGF1 concentrations (p = 0.05 and p = 0.019) were reduced. Placental function was also affected, with reduced placental efficiency (fetal/placental weight) (p = 0.049), decreased placental blood flow (p = 0.009) and fetal vessel volume (p = 0.002). Non-aggregated and ""fingerprint"" NP were observed at various locations, in maternal blood space, in trophoblastic cells and in the fetal blood, demonstrating transplacental transfer. Adult female offspring were bred with control males. Although fetoplacental biometry was not affected near term, second generation fetal metabolism was modified by grand-dam exposure with decreased plasma cholesterol (p = 0.008) and increased triglyceride concentrations (p = 0.015). Conclusions: Repeated daily gestational exposure to DE at levels close to urban pollution can affect feto-placental development in the first and second generation. © 2016 The Author(s).",,

Methods: We prospectively reviewed the records of 245 eyes of 245 patients scheduled to undergo SB surgery and 238 eyes of 238 patients scheduled to undergo PPV. ACD, CCT, and AL were measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and biometry, before surgery as well as 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Results: For both SB and PPV surgeries, ACD was observed to decrease significantly postoperatively, with this trend continuing throughout the follow-up period (p < 0.005). CCT showed no significant difference after PPV or SB surgery. AL increased significantly after SB surgery but not PPV. Conclusion: Our results show that SB surgery altered the shape of the eye by changing both ACD and AL. PPV resulted in altered ACD. These findings should elucidate the changes to be expected after SB and PPV surgeries. © 2016 The Author(s).","Anterior chamber depth; Axial length; Central cornea thickness; Optical coherence tomography; Retinal detachment","adolescent; adult; aged; anterior eye chamber; biometry; cornea; eye axis length; female; human; male; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; prospective study; Retinal Detachment; sclera buckling procedure; visual acuity; vitrectomy; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anterior Chamber; Axial Length, Eye; Biometry; Cornea; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Retinal Detachment; Scleral Buckling; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity; Vitrectomy; Young Adult"

The accuracy, reproducibility, and time required for analysis of 5D CNS were compared with that of two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound.Methods: This was a prospective study of 120 uncomplicated singleton pregnancies undergoing routine second trimester examination. For every pregnancy standard biometric measurements including biparietal diameter, head circumference, distal lateral ventricle width, transverse cerebellar diameter and cisterna magna width were obtained using 2D ultrasound and three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound with 5D CNS software. Reliability and agreement of the two techniques were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and proportionate Bland-Altman plots were constructed. The time necessary to complete the measurements with either technique was compared and intraobserver and interobserver agreements of measurements calculated.Results: In 118/120 (98.3%), 5D CNS successfully reconstructed the axial diagnostic planes and calculated all the basic biometric head and brain measurements. The agreement between the two techniques was high for all the measurements considered (all ICCS > 0.920). The time necessary to measure the biometric variables considered was significantly shorter with 5D CNS (54 versus 115 s, p < 0.0001) than with 2D ultrasonography. No significant differences were found in 5D CNS repeated measurements obtained either by the same observer or by two independent observers.Conclusion: 5D CNS software allows us to obtain reliable biometric measurements of the fetal brain and to reduce the examination time.

These features are extracted using a multistage algorithm. On the first stage the pupil center is localized using a fast circular symmetry detector and the iris radius is computed using radial gradient projections, and on the second stage the external shape of the eye (of the eyelids) is determined through a Monte Carlo sampling framework based on both color and shape information. Extensive experiments performed on a different dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

However, addressing this association is methodologically challenging. We conducted a prospective cohort study of nulliparous women with a singleton pregnancy in Cambridge, United Kingdom (2008-2012). Ultrasonic fetal biometry was performed at 20 weeks of gestation as per routine clinical care. Participants also had blinded research ultrasonography performed at approximately 28 weeks. Biometric measurements were expressed as gestational-age-adjusted z scores. Fetal growth velocity was quantified by change in z score between 20 weeks and 28 weeks. Risk of sPTB, defined as delivery at ≥28 weeks and <37 weeks associated with labor in the absence of induction, was analyzed using cause-specific Cox regression. Of 3,892 women, 98 (2.5%) had sPTB. When compared with the other decile groups, the lowest decile of growth velocity of the fetal femur between 20 and 28 weeks was associated with increased risk of sPTB (hazard ratio = 2.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.43, 3.93; P < 0.001). Adjustment for maternal characteristics had no material effect (hazard ratio = 2.50, 95% confidence interval: 1.50, 4.14; P < 0.001). There were no significant associations between other fetal measurements and risk of sPTB. To conclude, slow growth velocity of the fetal femur is associated with an increased risk of sPTB. © 2016 The Author 2016.

Thus, it is perhaps unsurprising that craniofacial abnormalities are among the most common birth defects in people, or that these defects have a complex genetic basis involving interactions among multiple loci. Developmental processes that depend on such epistatic interactions become exponentially more difficult to study in diploid organisms as the number of genes involved increases. Here, we present hybrid haploid males of the wasp species pair Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti, which have distinct male head morphologies, as a genetic model of craniofacial development that possesses the genetic advantages of haploidy, along with many powerful genomic tools. Viable, fertile hybrids can be made between the species, and quantitative trail loci related to shape differences have been identified. In addition, a subset of hybrid males show head abnormalities, including clefting at the midline and asymmetries. Crucially, epistatic interactions among multiple loci underlie several developmental differences and defects observed in the F2 hybrid males. Furthermore, we demonstrate an introgression of a chromosomal region from N. giraulti into N. vitripennis that shows an abnormality in relative eye size, which maps to a region containing a major QTL for this trait. Therefore, the genetic sources of head morphology can, in principle, be identified by positional cloning. Thus, Nasonia is well positioned to be a uniquely powerful model invertebrate system with which to probe both development and complex genetics of craniofacial patterning and defects. © 2015 The Authors.","Cleft palette; Craniofacial; Epistasis; Hybrid; Introgression; Nasonia; QTL","animal experiment; Article; craniofacial development; craniofacial malformation; craniofacial morphology; embryo pattern formation; epistasis; female; gene locus; genetic cross; genetic model; haploidy; interspecific hybridization; introgression; invertebrate; male; molecular cloning; Nasonia giraulti; Nasonia vitripennis; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative trait locus; quantitative trait locus mapping; skull malformation; wasp; abnormalities; anatomy and histology; animal; biometry; chromosomal mapping; comparative study; craniofacial malformation; disease model; epistasis; gene; genetics; haploidy; head; hybridization; insect chromosome; morphogenesis; sexual development; species difference; wasp; Animals; Biometry; Body Patterning; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Insect; Craniofacial Abnormalities; Disease Models, Animal; Epistasis, Genetic; Female; Genes, Insect; Haploidy; Head; Hybridization, Genetic; Male; Quantitative Trait Loci; Sex Characteristics; Species Specificity; Wasps"

We analyzed paired trunk- and twigwood samples from 674 trees, representing 71 species in a subtropical evergreen forest to fill this knowledge gap. We found that larger tree size (i.e. diameter) results in denser trunkwood but lighter twigwood, whereas species stature affects only trunkwood negatively. Trunk- and twigwood density did not vary consistently with tree size and species stature, suggesting some functional divergence between the two locations. Generally, trunk- and twigwood density scaled positively and isometrically, with trunkwood being on average 8.3% denser than twigwood. However, there was a systematic increase in the relative difference in their densities from 2% to 15% across tree size groups. The relationship between trunk- and twigwood density overall is moderately strong (R2 = 0.3-0.6), but depends on both tree size and stature, becoming weaker for larger size and taller stature groups.

Recent advances in KVFI have shown that learning an effective similarity metric plays a critical role in the verification problem. However, most existing distance metric learning (DML) based KVFI methods use batch learning techniques to seek an optimal kin similarity metric, making them less scalable in practical verification tasks. To address this, we propose in this paper a scalable similarity learning (SSL) method for KVFI. Unlike existing DML-based solutions, SSL aims to learn a diagonal bilinear similarity model by online truncated gradient learning, which enjoys superiority in scalability and computational efficiency for practical KVFI with high-dimensional data. We further derive a multiview SSL algorithm by optimal fusion of the diagonal similarity models from multiple feature representations in a coherent online process, such that the interactions and correlations in multiview kin data can be leveraged to obtain refined and high-level information. Empirically, we evaluate our proposed method on two benchmark datasets against the state-of-the-art DML-based solutions, and the results demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive or better verification performance, and enjoys the superiority in scalability and computational efficiency. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Face recognition; Kin similarity; Kinship verification; Metric learning; Similarity fusion","Benchmarking; Clustering algorithms; Computer vision; Efficiency; Face recognition; Scalability; Benchmark datasets; Distance Metric Learning; High dimensional data; High-level information; Kin similarity; Metric learning; Similarity learning; Verification problems; Computational efficiency; algorithm; Article; biometry; consanguinity; controlled study; distance metric learning; face; facial expression; facial recognition; genetic similarity; genetic trait; human; image analysis; intermethod comparison; kinship verification; learning; neighborhood repulsed metric learning; online system; priority journal; scalable similarity learning"

However, its accuracy in the earlier stage of PACG before and after YAG laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) is not fully elucidated. Objective: This study was to assess the effect of YAG LPI in PACG patients with Pentacam. Methods: A prospective self-controlled study was performed. Thirty-five fellow eyes (pre-clinical stage of PACG) of acute PACG and 35 fellow eyes of chronic PACG were included in the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University from July, 2012 to December, 2013.YAG LPI was performed on the eyes, and the parameters of ocular anterior segment including central anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber volume (ACV) and peripheral anterior chamber angle (ACA) were measured and compared by Pentacam before and 1 day, 7 days, 28 days after operation. This study was approved by the Ethic Committee of the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Results: In pre-clinical stage of PACG eyes, the postoperative ACD and ACV values were increased in comparison with preoperation, showing significant differences among various time points (ACD: F=6.783, P=0.004; ACV: F=19.090, P=0.000), and no significant difference was found in ACA among different time points (F=0.153, P=0.928). In the fellow eyes of chronic PACG, the postoperative ACD and ACV values were larger than those of preoperation, with significant differences among various time points (ACD: F=21.576, P=0.000; ACV: F=47.506, P=0.000), and no significant difference was found in ACA among different time points (F=0.581, P=0.629). The change values of ACD and ACV were (0.064±0.022)mm and (27.840±4.963)mm3 in the eyes of pre-clinical stage of PACG, and those in the fellow eyes of chronic PACG were (0.047±0.020)mm and (21.000±3.278)mm3, showing significant differences between the two groups (ACD: t=2.783, P=0.008; ACV: t=5.749, P=0.000). Conclusions: Pentacam allows easy, fast, automatic and non-contact quantification and three-dimension image of the anterior chamber parameters before and after YAG LPI in pre-clinical stage of PACG eyes and fellow eyes of chronic PACG.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the SRK/T formula in predicting a target refraction ±1.0D in short and long eyes using ultrasound biometry after phacoemulsification. Methods: The present study was a retrospective analysis, which included 38 eyes with an AL < 22.0 mm (short AL), and 62 eyes ≥24.6 mm (long AL) that underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsification. Preoperative AL was measured by ultrasound biometry and SRK/T formula was used for IOL calculation. Three different IOLs were implanted in the capsular bag. The prediction error was defined as the difference between the achieved postoperative refraction, and attempted predicted target refraction. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS V21. Results: In short ALs, the mean age was 65.13 ± 9.49 year, the mean AL was 21.55 ± 0.45 mm, the mean K1 and K2 were 45.76 ± 1.77D and 46.09 ± 1.61D, the mean IOL power was 23.96 ± 1.92D, the mean attempted (predicted) value was 0.07 ± 0.26D, the mean achieved value was 0.07 ± 0.63 D, the mean PE was 0.01 ± 0.60D, and the MAE was 0.51 ± 0.31D. A significant positive relationship with AL and K1, K2, IOL power and a strong negative relationship with PE and achieved postoperative was found. In long ALs, the mean age was 64.05 ± 7.31 year, the mean AL was 25.77 ± 1.64 mm, the mean K1 and K2 were 42.20 ± 1.57D and 42.17 ± 1.68D, the mean IOL power was 15.79 ± 5.17D, the mean attempted value was -0.434 ± 0.315D, the mean achieved value was -0.42 ± 0.96D, the mean PE was -0.004 ± 0.93D, the MAE was 0.68 ± 0.62D. A significant positive relationship with AL and K1, K2 and a significant positive relationship with PE and achieved value, otherwise a negative relationship with AL and IOL power was found. There was a little tendency towards hyperopic for short ALs and myopic for long ALs. The majority of eyes (94.74 %) for short ALs and (70.97 %) for long ALs were within ±1 D of the predicted refractive error. No significant relationship with PE and IOL types, AL, K1, K2, IOL power, and attempted value, besides with MAE and AL, K1, K2, age, attempted, achieved value were found in both groups.

Methods In this prospective interventional case series, 21 primary angle closure suspects were enrolled. Intraocular pressure, refraction, ocular biometry (Lenstar, LS900), and anterior chamber parameters (Pentacam HR) were measured at four occasions: before PI (before and after mydriasis with phenylephrine) and two weeks after PI (before and after mydriasis). The study was conducted on both eyes and only one eye per patient, in random, was included in the analysis. Results The mean age of the participants was 60 ± 7 years and 17 (81%) were female. There were no significant differences in intraocular pressure, refraction, keratometry, biometric and anterior chamber parameters between groups, except for anterior chamber volume, which showed increments with PI and mydriasis. The corresponding values for anterior chamber volume were as follows: 88.2 ± 13.7 mm3 before PI, undilated; 106.3 ± 18.8 before PI, dilated; 99.0 ± 14.6 after PI, undilated, and 107.4 ± 16.5 after PI, dilated (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions This study showed no change in the ocular biometric and anterior chamber parameters including iridocorneal angle after PI and/or pharmacologic mydriasis except for increments in anterior chamber volume.

Content: After a brief review of Petit's life and his studies in neurology, anatomy, and cataract surgery, the methodology and results of his work in measuring many of the biometric parameters of the human eye are discussed. Among other techniques, he made use of frozen sections of eyes to explore their dimensions and employed an immersion technique to avoid the effect of corneal refraction on the appearance of the iris. His pioneering biometric results have been largely confirmed by modern studies. Those on the changes in the crystalline lens with age are particularly striking and suggest that these ocular aging effects have changed little over the last 300 years. Although largely forgotten today, his biometric work exercised a considerable influence on his more immediate successors, including Porterfield and Thomas Young.

Setting Ophthalmology Department, Calderdale Royal Hospital, Halifax, United Kingdom. Design Retrospective case series. Methods Consecutive eyes having phacovitrectomy for macula-off RRD were evaluated. The ALs were measured using optical biometry with user adjustment to identify a posterior peak corresponding to the eye's AL and ultrasound (US). These were compared with each other and with the postoperative optical biometry and analyzed for accuracy as an indication of the eye's AL. Results The study comprised 22 eyes of 22 patients. There was no statistically significant difference between the mean AL measurements derived from user-adjusted optical biometry and US AL (P = .964). The user-adjusted optical biometry was not statistically significantly different from the postoperative optical biometry (P = .242). Compared with the postoperative optical biometry, the IOL power was within ±0.5 diopter in 12 (92%) of 13 cases (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.8 to 100.0) for user-adjusted optical biometry and in 10 (77%) of 13 cases (95% CI, 54.0 to 99.8) for US measurements. Conclusions User-adjusted optical biometry could be used as an alternative method for measuring AL in macula-off RRD with combined phacovitrectomy. However, optical biometry would require assessment of agreement with US AL in cases in which a posterior peak is not easily identifiable. User-adjusted optical biometry might outperform US AL when calculating IOL power; however, a larger study should be performed to confirm this.

Our aim was to provide new reference data of the fetal vermis in 4 biometric parameters by using 3 imaging modalities, 2D ultrasound, 3D ultrasound, and MR imaging, and to assess the relation among these modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted between June 2011 and June 2013. Three different imaging modalities were used to measure vermis biometry: 2D ultrasound, 3D ultrasound, and MR imaging. The vermian parameters evaluated were the maximum superoinferior diameter, maximum anteroposterior diameter, the perimeter, and the surface area. Statistical analysis was performed to calculate centiles for gestational age and to assess the agreement among the 3 imaging modalities. RESULTS: The number of fetuses in the study group was 193, 172, and 151 for 2D ultrasound, 3D ultrasound, and MR imaging, respectively. The mean and median gestational ages were 29.1 weeks, 29.5 weeks (range, 21-35 weeks); 28.2 weeks, 29.05 weeks (range, 21-35 weeks); and 32.1 weeks, 32.6 weeks (range, 27-35 weeks) for 2D ultrasound, 3D ultrasound, and MR imaging, respectively. In all 3 modalities, the biometric measurements of the vermis have shown a linear growth with gestational age. For all 4 biometric parameters, the lowest results were those measured by MR imaging, while the highest results were measured by 3D ultrasound. The inter-and intraobserver agreement was excellent for all measures and all imaging modalities.

Thus, 439 stations (open water, helophytes, elodeids) were studied among 274 pastoral ponds (mid-west Poland). In each trophic state of waters a key predictor of zooplankton diversity was biomass of macrophytes attributed to a variety of ecological types or various species of macrophytes. A shift from the high importance of elodeids (e.g. Myriophyllum, Ceratophyllum demersum) in structuring zooplankton diversity in mesotrophic waters to helophytes (Typha angustifolia, Phragmites australis, Schoenoplectus lacustris) in hypereutrophic ponds was recorded. Hypereutrophy proved to be extremely unfavourable for zooplankton, as reflected in its lowest diversity; rotifers reached their optimum in eutrophy and crustaceans in mesotrophy. Adverse environmental conditions in hypereutrophic waters caused the elimination of macrophyte-dominated refuges, thereby lowering the macrophyte-site share, which ranged from 47% in eutrophy, 40% in mesotrophy to only 20% in hypereutrophy. Therefore, we assume that zooplankton diversity and macrophyte occurrence can be used for quality assessment of small water bodies. © 2015, The Author(s).","Aquatic plant biomass; Environmental predictors; Rotifer and crustacean diversity; Shallow ponds; Trophic status","Ceratophyllum demersum; Crustacea; Myriophyllum; Phragmites australis; Rotifera; Schoenoplectus lacustris; Typha angustifolia"

This study concurrently evaluated the effects of the Valsalva maneuver (VM) on the anterior and posterior ocular biometric parameters in a healthy Chinese cohort. METHODS. This prospective, cross-sectional study used anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) and swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) to measure the anterior and posterior ocular biometric parameters before and during the VM. Sixty-three volunteers (126 eyes; 17 males and 46 females) were enrolled. The IOP, blood pressure (BP), and refractive error were recorded before and during a VM. RESULTS. The mean IOP showed a statistically significant increase (from 13.86-14.25 mm Hg, P = 0.005), but the different layers of the retina and the choroidal thickness (CT) showed no significant changes. The anterior chamber parameters decreased sharply from the baseline, with a smaller angle opening distance (AOD500; from 0.35-0.31 mm, P &lt; 0.001), AOD750 (from 0.44-0.39 mm, P = 0.007), trabecular-iris space area (TISA500; from 0.14-0.13 mm, P = 0.027), TISA750 (from 0.25-0.23 mm, P = 0.007), and anterior chamber volume (ACV; from 143.09-139.84 mm3 P = 0.036). Regression analyses revealed an association between DIOP and the baseline IOP (β = 0.26 [0.15, 0.37], P &lt; 0.001) and DACW (b =-3.24 [-5.65, -0.83], P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS. This study is the first to provide simultaneous evaluation of the effects of the VM on anterior and posterior ocular biometric parameters. The VM caused a significant IOP increase and narrowing of the angles in healthy subjects. However, it did not change the CT in the macular region.

At the turn of the century, eugenics seemed poised to grant industrial nations unprecedented control over their own future, but that potential depended on contested understandings of the biological mechanisms of inheritance. Early in his career, Keynes helped William Bateson, Britain's chief proponent of Mendelian genetics, analyze problems in human heredity. Simultaneously, Keynes publicly opposed the efforts by Francis Galton and Karl Pearson to study inheritance through statistical biometry. For Keynes, this conflict was morally laden: Mendelism incorporated the only ethical theory of uncertainty, while biometry rested on false and dangerous concepts. This early study of heredity shaped Keynes's visions of industrial democracy after 1918. Liberals looked for a system of societal and economic management to engineer an escape from the postwar Malthusian trap. Britain's economic plight, Keynes argued, was rooted in the hereditary weaknesses of its leadership. Successful technocratic liberalism would depend on control over the quality as well as quantity of human beings. Ultimately, in his essay Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren, Keynes predicted that effective eugenic management would bring about capitalism's end. © The North American Conference on British Studies 2016.","biometry; Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren; eugenics; genetics; John Maynard Keynes; Karl Pearson; liberalism; population; probability; statistics; William Bateson",

Posterior eye shape assessment by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to study myopia. We tested the hypothesis that optical coherence tomography (OCT), as an alternative, could measure posterior eye shape similarly to MRI. METHODS. Macular spectral-domain OCT and brain MRI images previously acquired as part of the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study were analyzed. The right eye in the MRI and OCT images was automatically segmented. Optical coherence tomography segmentations were corrected for optical and display distortions requiring biometry data. The segmentations were fitted to spheres and ellipsoids to obtain the posterior eye radius of curvature (Rc) and asphericity (Qxz). The differences in Rc and Qxz measured by MRI and OCT were tested using paired t-tests. Categorical assignments of prolateness or oblateness using Qxz were compared. RESULTS. Fifty-two subjects (67.8 ± 5.6 years old) with spherical equivalent refraction from +0.50 to -5.38 were included. The mean paired difference between MRI and original OCT posterior eye Rc was 24.03 ± 46.49 mm (P = 0.0005). For corrected OCT images, the difference in Rc decreased to -0.23 ± 2.47 mm (P = 0.51). The difference between MRI and OCT asphericity, Qxz, was -0.052 ± 0.343 (P = 0.28). However, categorical agreement was only moderate (j = 0.50). CONCLUSIONS. Distortion-corrected OCT measurements of Rc and Qxz were not statistically significantly different from MRI, although the moderate categorical agreement suggests that individual differences remained. This study provides evidence that with distortion correction, noninvasive office-based OCT could potentially be used instead of MRI for the study of posterior eye shape. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

Fifty pregnant women underwent 3-dimensional sonographic examinations for fractional arm and thigh volumes at a mean menstrual age of 31.3 weeks. Manual and semiautomated fractional limb volume measurements were calculated, with the semiautomated measurements calculated by novel software (5D Limb Vol; Samsung Medison, Seoul, Korea). The software applies an image transformation method based on the major axis length, minor axis length, and limb center coordinates. A transformed image is used to perform a global optimization technique for determination of an optimal limb soft tissue boundary. Bland-Altman analysis defined bias with 95% limits of agreement (LOA) between methods, and timing differences between manual versus automated methods were compared by a paired t test. Bland-Altman analysis indicated an acceptable bias with 95% LOA between the manual and semiautomated methods: mean arm volume ± SD, 1.7% ± 4.6% (95% LOA, -7.3% to 10.7%); and mean thigh volume, 0.0% ± 3.8% (95% LOA, -7.5% to 7.5%). The computer-assisted software completed measurements about 5 times faster compared to manual tracings. In conclusion, semiautomated fractional limb volume measurements are significantly faster to calculate when compared to a manual procedure. These results are reproducible and are likely to reduce operator dependency. The addition of computer-assisted fractional limb volume to standard biometry may improve the precision of estimated fetal weight by adding a soft tissue component to the weight estimation process. © 2016 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.","3-dimensional sonography; Estimated fetal weight; Fractional arm volume; Fractional thigh volume; Obstetric ultrasound","Automation; Computer software; Fetal monitoring; Global optimization; Tissue; Titration; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonic imaging; Ultrasonography; 3-dimensional sonography; Fetal weight; Fractional arm volume; Global optimization techniques; Image analysis tools; Image transformations; Sonographic examinations; Thigh volume; Volume measurement; biometry; clinical article; computer program; echography; female; fetus; fetus weight; human; image analysis; instrument validation; intermethod comparison; pregnant woman; reproducibility; soft tissue; South Korea; Student t test; thigh; arm; cohort analysis; diagnostic imaging; embryology; fetus echography; image processing; pregnancy; procedures; prospective study; thigh; three dimensional imaging; Arm; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Thigh; Ultrasonography, Prenatal"

To evaluate the accuracy of the optical coherence tomography-based (OCT formula) and Barrett True K (True K) intraocular lens (IOL) calculation formulas in eyes with previous radial keratotomy (RK). METHODS. In 95 eyes of 65 patients, using the actual refraction following cataract surgery as target refraction, the predicted IOL power for each method was calculated. The IOL prediction error (PE) was obtained by subtracting the predicted IOL power from the implanted IOL power. The arithmetic IOL PE and median refractive PE were calculated and compared. RESULTS. All formulas except the True K produced hyperopic IOL PEs at 1 month, which decreased at ≥4 months (all P < 0.05). For the double-K Holladay 1, OCT formula, True K, and average of these three formulas (Average), the median absolute refractive PEs were, respectively, 0.78 diopters (D), 0.74 D, 0.60 D, and 0.59 D at 1 month; 0.69 D, 0.77 D, 0.77 D, and 0.61 D at 2 to 3 months; and 0.34 D, 0.65 D, 0.69 D, and 0.46 D at ≥4 months. The Average produced significantly smaller refractive PE than did the double-K Holladay 1 at 1 month (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in refractive PEs among formulas at 4 months. CONCLUSIONS. The OCT formula and True K were comparable to the double-K Holladay 1 method on the ASCRS (American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery) calculator.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, multistage sampling was used to select 300 clusters, including 6,311 individuals from the city of Shahroud. All selected participants underwent examinations in one place. Optometric examinations, including measurement of visual acuity and refraction, and ophthalmologic examinations, including slit-lamp examination, were performed for all participants. Moreover, all patients underwent imaging with the Pentacam. Results: The mean ACA and ACV was 34.3° (95% confidence interval [CI]: 34.1°-34.5°) and 139 L (95% CI: 137.7-140.3), respectively. In a multiple linear regression model, the ACA was inversely correlated with age (coefficient=-0.08), lens thickness (coefficient=-1.38), corneal diameter (coefficient=-0.36), and corneal curvature (coefficient=-1.43), and directly correlated with the anterior chamber depth (ACD) (coefficient=6.59). In another model, ACV was inversely correlated with age (coefficient=-0.37), central corneal thickness (coefficient=-0.04), and spherical equivalent (coefficient=-1.15), and directly correlated with the ACD (coefficient=85.67), lens thickness (coefficient=14.15), corneal diameter (coefficient=4.80), corneal curvature (coefficient=18.43), ACA (coefficient=0.65), and intraocular pressure (coefficient=0.23). Conclusion: The findings of this study could be used as a reference for diagnosis and treatment in Iran and the Middle East region. Increase in age and decrease in the ACD were important factors associated with decreased ACA and ACV, although the correlation of other biometric components was also evaluated.

Results Sixty-nine comparable vessels were analysed. Six vessels were excluded due to artefact or technical error. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated the ultrasound indices were comparable, although systematically lower than the MRI indices; Right UtA RI bias -0.03 (95% limits of agreement (LOA) -0.27 to +0.20), and left UtA RI bias -0.06 (95% LOA -0.26 to +0.14); Right UtA PI bias -0.06 (95% LOA -0.50 to +0.38), Left UtA PI bias -0.11 (95% LOA -0.54 to +0.32). The inter-rater agreement for the MRI derived PI and RI analysis was good. Conclusion This study demonstrates that in the majority of early third trimester pregnancies, the uterine arteries can be identified, and their flow profiles measured using MRI, and that the derived PI and RI values are comparable with Doppler ultrasound values. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: This study utilized ultrasound images acquired from women participating in the Oxford arm of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project. In the first phase of the study, BPDoo and BPDoi were measured on stored images. In the second phase, real-time measurements of BPD, occipitofrontal diameter (OFD) and HC in TT and TV planes were obtained by pairs of sonographers. Reproducibility of measurements made by the same (intraobserver) and by different (interobserver) sonographers, as well as the reproducibility of caliper placement and measurements obtained in different planes, was assessed using Bland–Altman plots. Results: In Phase I, we analyzed ultrasound images of 108 singleton fetuses. The mean intraobserver and interobserver differences were &lt; 2% (1.34 mm) and the 95% limits of agreement were &lt; 5% (3 mm) for both BPDoo and BPDoi. Neither method for measuring BPD showed consistently better reproducibility. In Phase II, we analyzed ultrasound images of 100 different singleton fetuses. The mean intraobserver and interobserver differences were &lt; 1% (2.26 mm) and the 95% limits of agreement were &lt; 8% (14.45 mm) for all fetal head measurements obtained in TV and TT planes. Neither plane for measuring fetal head showed consistently better reproducibility. Measurement of HC using the ellipse facility was as reproducible as HC calculated from BPD and OFD. OFD by itself was the least reproducible of all fetal head measurements. Conclusions: Measurements of BPDoi and BPDoo are equally reproducible; however, we believe BPDoo should be used in clinical practice as it allows fetal HC to be measured and compared with neonatal HC. For all head measurements, TV and TT planes provide equally reproducible values at any gestational age, and HC values are similar in both planes. Fetal head measurement in the TT plane is preferable as international standards in this plane are available; however, measurements in the TV plane can be plotted on the same standards. © 2016 ISUOG.

Beginning in 2017, Medicare will expand diagnostic categories subject to financial penalties for excess postoperative readmissions to include coronary revascularization procedures. Arrhythmias and pulmonary complications comprise the largest categories for readmission after cardiac surgery. Technologic advances in remote monitoring have led to the use of web-based digital health kits (DHK) aimed at reducing readmissions and improving postoperative outcomes. The present study was performed to determine the added benefit of incorporating DHK's into a formal readmissions reduction program (RRP) in preventing 30-d readmissions and to evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with the use of these devices. Materials and methods This was a prospective study of all adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution from March 2014 to June 2015. During the study period, 443 adult patients (mean age, 65 ± 14, 33% female) were identified and participated in the formal RRP, 27 of whom also received a DHK after discharge (416 control group). In addition to providing a live video link to a provider specializing in cardiac surgery, the DHK also allowed for automatic daily transmission of weight, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure. Patients also completed a daily health survey targeting symptoms concerning for heart failure, poor wound healing, poor ambulation, and nonadherence to medications. Abnormal vitals or survey responses triggered automatic notifications to the healthcare team. Satisfaction surveys were administered to participants and members of the healthcare team. Pearson χ2 test and the Welch's t-test were used to assess statistical differences in baseline characteristics and outcome variables. Results During the study period, the readmission rate for the DHK and control groups were similar (7.4% versus 9.9%, P = 0.65). The use of DHKs led to 1649 alerts and 144 interventions, with the highest number of alerts occurring during d 5-9. The majority of alerts (64%) were prompted by abnormal biometric measurements, and a significant correlation was noted between abnormal biometrics and required intervention (r = 0.62, P &lt; 0.001). No correlation was seen between alerts because of health survey responses (r = 0.07, P = 0.71) or missed check-ins (r = 0.06, P = 0.76) and required interventions. Poststudy satisfaction surveys showed an overall satisfaction rating of 4.9 ± 0.5 for DHK patients and 4.9 ± 0.2 for members of the care team (scale 1-5, 5 = agree). Conclusions In our study, adding DHKs to a formal RRP was not associated with a significant decrease in 30-d readmission rates. We also found that notifications because of abnormal biometric measures were significantly correlated with required interventions. In contrast, notifications due to abnormal health survey responses were not associated with increased interventions. Both patients and members of the healthcare team were highly satisfied with this technology. DHKs appear to extend care beyond the inpatient period and provide a portal for telemonitoring of surgical patients. However, this modality is highly resource intensive and may not significantly reduce readmissions. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of such kits in reducing readmissions and costs of care.","Cardiac surgery; Digital health kits; Outcomes; Patient satisfaction; Readmission reduction; Surgical readmissions; Telehealth","amiodarone; adult; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; biometry; blood pressure; body weight; cerebrovascular accident; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; digital health kit; faintness; female; health program; heart failure; heart rate; heart surgery; hospital readmission; human; kidney failure; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; outcome variable; oxygen saturation; patient mobility; patient monitor; patient satisfaction; pilot study; pneumonia; postoperative complication; priority journal; prospective study; readmissions reduction program; reoperation; sepsis; surgical infection; surgical mortality; surgical patient; telemonitoring; treatment refusal; vital sign; wound healing; clinical trial; health personnel attitude; health survey; hospital readmission; middle aged; postoperative care; Postoperative Complications; procedures; statistics and numerical data; telemedicine; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Readmission; Patient Satisfaction; Postoperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Telemedicine; Treatment Outcome; Vital Signs"

To date, neuroimaging attempts to interpret large-scale activity or connectivity results often turn to existing neural mapping based on previous literature. In case of a large number of results, manual selection or percent of overlap with existing maps is frequently used to facilitate interpretation, often without a clear statistical justification. Such methodology holds the risk of reporting false positive results and overlooking additional results. Here, we propose using enrichment analysis for improving the interpretation of large-scale neuroimaging results. We focus on two possible cases: position group analysis, where the identified results are a set of neural positions; and connection group analysis, where the identified results are a set of neural position-pairs (i.e. neural connections). We explore different models for detecting significant overrepresentation of known functional brain annotations using simulated and real data. We implemented our methods in a tool called RichMind, which provides both statistical significance reports and brain visualization. We demonstrate the abilities of RichMind by revisiting two previous fMRI studies. In both studies RichMind automatically highlighted most of the findings that were reported in the original studies as well as several additional findings that were overlooked. Hence, RichMind is a valuable new tool for rigorous inference from neuroimaging results. © 2016 Maron-Katz et al.

Methods: Sixty-eight eyes of 34 patients with schizophrenia and 60 eyes of 30 randomly selected healthy volunteers were involved in the study. Measurements of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, macula thickness, and macula volume were taken in both eyes using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0. Results: Average and nasal RNFL thicknesses were found to be significantly lower in the patient group than the control group (p = 0.030, p = 0.04, respectively). Macular thicknesses of nasal outer and inferior outer quadrants in the patient group were significantly lower than in the control group (p = 0.009, p = 0.027, respectively). Average macular thickness and macular thicknesses in the superior outer, superior inner, temporal outer, temporal inner, nasal inner, and inferior inner areas were lower in the patient group compared to the control group, but not significantly (p = 1.000, p = 1.000, p = 0.837, p = 1.000, p = 0.279, p = 1.000, p = 0.180, respectively). Conclusions: We detected RNFL and macular thinning in patients with schizophrenia. Based on these findings and results of other studies evaluating retina using OCT and brain magnetic resonance imaging studies in patients with schizophrenia, a neurodegenerative process may be an underlying pathologic mechanism in this disease. © 2015 Wichtig Publishing.","Macular thickness; Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness; Schizophrenia","adult; biometry; complication; female; human; male; middle aged; nerve fiber; normal human; optical coherence tomography; organ size; pathology; procedures; retina; retina ganglion cell; schizophrenia; Adult; Biometry; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Fibers; Organ Size; Retina; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Schizophrenia; Tomography, Optical Coherence"

Previously, this specimen had been identified as Dicerorhinus nipponicus. However, the specimen shares the following features with the genus Stephanorhinus: molarised premolars; absence of P1; absence of metacone fold on P3 and P4; presence of crochet on the premolars and molars; presence of a crista on the molars; absence of medifossette on both premolars and molars; triangular-shaped M3.

Methods Tooth measurements were obtained from a sample of 56 patients with normal occlusion, with a normal Bolton index (22 men, 34 women; mean age, 27.8 years), without previous orthodontic treatment or prosthetic or Class II restorations. Maxillary and mandibular measurements were analyzed separately in the sexes. Clustering was performed using the partitioning around medoid algorithm and principal component analysis-based transformed data. Statistical analysis was conducted. Results The multivariate analysis showed 3 distinct clusters of both maxillary and mandibular tooth measurements in the male and female subjects. Statistically significant differences were found between the sexes in terms of average tooth measurements, and there was significant proportionality between the maxillary and mandibular arch clusters. Conclusion Although the Bolton index is useful for identifying dentodental discrepancies in most patients, cluster analysis enabled the mandibular and maxillary tooth dimensions of the male and female subjects to be divided into 3 general classes (clusters) and the precise location of the discrepancies to be pinpointed. © 2016 American Association of Orthodontists",,"adult; cluster analysis; crowding (area); female; human; human tissue; Italian (citizen); major clinical study; male; mandible; maxilla; normal human; odontometry; orthodontic procedure; principal component analysis; tooth occlusion; anatomy and histology; biometry; odontometry; procedures; reference value; tooth; Adult; Biometry; Dental Occlusion; Female; Humans; Male; Odontometry; Reference Values; Tooth"

In preterm infants, the cerebellum grows particularly rapid and hypoplasia and cellular lesions are associated with motor dysfunction and cognitive deficits. We hypothesized that functional brain delays observed in preterm pigs would be paralleled by both structural and molecular differences in the cerebellum relative to term born piglets. Cerebella were collected from term (n = 56) and preterm (90% gestation, n = 112) pigs at 0, 5, and 26 days after birth for stereological volume estimations, large-scale qPCR gene expression analyses (selected neurodevelopmental genes) and western blot protein expression analysis (Sonic Hedgehog pathway). Memory and learning was tested using a T-maze, documenting that preterm pigs showed delayed learning. Preterm pigs also showed reduced volume of both white and gray matter at all three ages but the proportion of white matter increased postnatally, relative to term pigs. Early initiation of enteral nutrition had limited structural or molecular effects. The Sonic Hedgehog pathway was unaffected by preterm birth. Few differences in expression of the selected genes were found, except consistently higher mRNA levels of Midkine, p75, and Neurotrophic factor 3 in the preterm cerebellum postnatally, probably reflecting an adaptive response to preterm birth. Pig cerebellar development appears more affected by postconceptional age than by environmental factors at birth or postnatally. Compensatory mechanisms following preterm birth may include faster white matter growth and increased expression of selected genes for neurotrophic factors and regulation of angiogenesis. While the pig cerebellum is immature in 90% gestation preterm pigs, it appears relatively mature and resilient toward environmental factors. © 2016 The Authors.

Association analyses were carried out to determine independently associated systemic and ocular factors for anterior chamber angle width using a generalized estimating equation model. RESULTS. A total of 3014 subjects (48% female) with a mean age of 58.6 ± 10.4 years were included in this study. The mean anterior chamber angle width was 32.6° ±5.5°. Statistical analysis revealed an independent association between a smaller anterior chamber angle and female sex, higher age, and more hyperopic refraction. When including biometric parameters, shallow anterior chamber depth, shorter axial length, higher central corneal thickness, and lower corneal power were independently associated with a narrower mean anterior chamber angle width. CONCLUSIONS. These parameters are considered risk factors for angle-closure glaucoma. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

This species is first recorded at ca. 1.7-1.6 Ma (late Villafranchian, late Early Pleistocene) in NE Iberian Peninsula, roughly coinciding with the large faunal turnover that occurred around the middle to late Villafranchian boundary. Here we describe the largest collection of L. pardinus remains available to date from the Iberian late Early Pleistocene (Epivillafranchian), including localities from the Vallparadís Section (Vallès-Penedès Basin, NE Iberian Peninsula) and Cueva Victoria (Cartagena, SE Iberian Peninsula). The morphology and biometry of the studied material attests to the widespread occurrence of L. pardinus in the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula since the latest Early Pleistocene, i.e., about 0.5 million years earlier than it was generally accepted (i.e., at the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene). Based on the features observed in the large sample studied in this paper, we conclude that Lynx spelaeus is a junior synonym of L. pardinus and further propose to assign all the Epivillafranchian and younger fossil lynxes from SW Europe to the extant species L. pardinus. Due to the arrival of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) into Europe at the beginning of the Late Pleistocene, the attribution of specimens younger than MIS 5e to either this species or L. pardinus solely on morphological grounds has proven equivocal. Here we discuss the main diagnostic features of both species of European lynxes and further review their evolutionary history and paleobiogeography throughout the Pleistocene. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Cal Guardiola; Cueva Victoria; Iberian lynx; Lynx spelaeus; Pleistocene; Vallparadís Estació","Geology; Natural sciences; Cal Guardiola; Cueva Victoria; Iberian lynx; Lynx spelaeus; Pleistocene; Mammals; Carnivora; Felidae; Guardiola; Lynx; Lynx lynx; Lynx pardinus"

To conduct biometrics of the different structures of the hindbrain, establishing changes in these structures depending on gestational age. Material and methods We conducted a prospective study in 362 pregnant women from February-December 2013. The women were at 11-13+6 weeks of pregnancy (crl: 45-84 mm.). Vaginal and abdominal examinations were carried out. The fetus was viewed in mid-sagittal plane, rear back, with visualization of the reference markers for nuchal translucency (NT). View of 4 echogenic parallel lines in the hindbrain: 1st. Sphenoid bone rear ridge. 2nd Rear ridge of the anterior brainstem of the forth ventricle. 3rd Fourth ventricle choroid plexus. 4th Occipital bone. These lines delimit 3 echonegative spaces of similar echogenicity: 1st Brainstem. 2nd Forth ventricle. 3rd Cisterna magna. Their biometries and the brainstem/brainstem- occipital bone ratio were obtained. Results The mean crl was 64.65 mm (range 46.97-84). It was possible to obtain a mid-sagittal plane and visualize 4 lines–three spaces and a biometry in 98.6%. The biometrics were in agreement with those reported in the literature; they increased with gestational age and their thickness decreased. The ratio was constant. None of the fetuses evaluated in the 20th week ultrasonography and/or at birth had OSB. We confirm the usefulness of obtaining this view after finishing the study, in a case in which we only identified 3 lines–2 spaces, which prompted us to focus on the spine and diagnose OSB at a lumbosacral level. Conclusions Further studies are required, but we suggest including simple visualization of 4 lines–3 spaces as a routine step in OSB screening. If this visualization is abnormal or questionable, biometrics and a more meticulous cranio-spinal examination should be carried out taking into account the option of ultrasonography. © 2015 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","First trimester; Four-line view; Intracranial translucency; Posterior fossa; Prenatal diagnosis; Spina bifida; Ultrasound",

Currently, IUGR classification is based upon the system of ultrasound biometry. Doppler velocimetry allows the measurement of hemodynamic flow of major fetal vessels, comparing the flow indices and patterns of normal and IUGR cases. In this review, the effectiveness of Doppler velocimetry in assessing blood flow in major vessels including the umbilical artery, ductus venosus, and middle cerebral artery was studied for both diagnostic and prognostic screening of IUGR. The umbilical artery is the most frequently studied vessel in Doppler velocimetry due to its accessibility and the strength of its associations with fetal outcomes. Abnormalities in the ductus venosus waveform can be indicative of increased resistance in the right atrium due to placental abnormalities. The middle cerebral artery is the most studied fetal cerebral artery and can detect cerebral blood flow and direction, which is why these three vessels were selected to be examined in this context. A potential mathematical model could be developed to incorporate these Doppler measurements which are indicative of IUGR, in order to reduce perinatal mortality. The purpose of the proposed algorithm is to integrate Doppler velocimetry with biophysical profiling in order to determine the optimal timing of delivery, thus reducing the risks of adverse perinatal outcomes. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.","doppler velocimetry; ductus venosus; Intrauterine growth restriction; IUGR; middle cerebral artery; SGA; small-for-gestational age; umbilical artery",

Previous ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) studies showed that accommodative optical response (AOR) can be predicted from accommodative biometric changes in a young and a pre-presbyopic population from linear relationships between accommodative optical and biometric changes, with a standard deviation of less than 0.55D. Here, paraxial schematic eyes (SE) were constructed from measured accommodative ocular biometry parameters to see if predictions are improved. Methods. Measured ocular biometry (OCT, A-scan, and UBM) parameters from 24 young and 24 pre-presbyopic subjects were used to construct paraxial SEs for each individual subject (individual SEs) for three different lens equivalent refractive index methods. Refraction and AOR calculated from the individual SEs were compared with Grand Seiko (GS) autorefractor measured refraction and AOR. Refraction and AOR were also calculated from individual SEs constructed using the average population accommodative change in UBM measured parameters (average SEs). Results. Schematic eye calculated and GS measured AOR were linearly related (young subjects: slope = 0.77, r2 = 0.86; pre-presbyopic subjects: slope = 0.64, r2 = 0.55). The mean difference in AOR (GS - individual SEs) for the young subjects was -0.27D and for the pre-presbyopic subjects was 0.33D. For individual SEs, the mean ± SD of the absolute differences in AOR between the GS and SEs was 0.50 ± 0.39Dfor the young subjects and 0.50 ± 0.37D for the pre-presbyopic subjects. For average SEs, the mean ± SD of the absolute differences in AOR between the GS and the SEs was 0.77 ± 0.88D for the young subjects and 0.51 ± 0.49D for the pre-presbyopic subjects. Conclusions. Individual paraxial SEs predict AOR, on average, with a standard deviation of 0.50D in young and prepresbyopic subject populations. Although this prediction is only marginally better than from individual linear regressions, it does consider all the ocular biometric parameters.

To determine the relationship between accommodative lag and rate of myopia progression when Ghanaian myopic school children are either undercorrected or fully corrected with single vision lenses. Methods. A 2-year single masked randomized control trial was conducted using 150 Ghanaian myopic children aged 10 to 15 years with mean baseline myopia of-1.98 Â± 0.50D. The children were randomly assigned to wear either a full correction (n = 75) or +0.50D undercorrection (UC) (n = 75) single vision lenses. Repeated measurements which included refractive error and accommodative response at 33 and 28.6 cm for FC and UC, respectively, were performed using Open-Field Autorefractor whereas ocular biometry results were obtained using A-Scan ultrasonography. Results were based on the right eye and analyzed using STATA 11. Results. After 24 months, the mean myopia progression of children in the FC group (-0.54 Â± 0.26D) was not significantly different from that of the children in the UC group (-0.5 Â± 0.22D) (p = 0.31). There was no significant difference between the mean values of the initial near lag and the average lag measured 24 months later in both groups (FC: initial lag -0.74 Â± 0.17D, average lag -0.72 Â± 0.15D, p = 0.44; UC: initial lag -0.57 Â± 0.14D, average lag -0.58 Â± 0.15D; p = 0.67). Also, there was no significant correlation between refractive change seen in 24months and either the first near lag for both FC (r = -0.05, p = 0.43) andUC (r =-0.08, p = 0.43) or the average near lag of accommodation for both FC (r =-0.02, p = 0.49) and UC (r = -0.04, p = 0.49). Conclusions. This study showed no relationship between lag of accommodation and rate of myopia progression in children with progressing myopia. Different ethnic groups may respond differently to the same size of hyperopic blur.

Three consecutive measurements were performed on each eye in the following order: Lenstar, IOLMaster, and Ultrasound. The repeatabilities of the AL measurements for each instrument were assessed by calculating the pooled coefficients of variation (CVs) of 18 eyes in each group. Comparisons between the HM and normal groups were made with independent sample t-tests. The inter-device agreements were evaluated with Bland-Altman analyses and paired two-tailed t-tests. • RESULTS: For normal group, the CVs of the AL measurements taken with the Lenstar, IOLMaster and Ultrasound were 0.001%, 0.01% and 0.14%, respectively. The corresponding CVs for the HM group were 0.005%, 0.02% and 0.15%, respectively. There was significant difference between the Lenstar and the IOLMaster in normal group (P=0.031) but not in HM group (P=0.100). In the two groups, the Lenstar and the IOLMaster produced higher values than did the Ultrasound (all P<0.001). All three instruments exhibited good agreement in terms of AL values. For the intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation using SRK II formula, the Lenstar and the IOLMaster showed 0.5 D higher than Ultrasound in both groups (all P<0.001). No significant difference existed between the Lenstar and the IOLMaster for the IOL power calculation in both normal (P=0.474) and HM group (P=0.103). • CONCLUSION: The three devices exhibited excellent intra-visit repeatabilities in the AL measurements.

Control and accelerated groups had completed spawning by the time of harvest, and expressed sexual dimorphism in various biometric and flesh quality parameters. Pyridinoline cross-links, a key biochemical parameter investigated, were positively correlated with texture (r2 = 0.4), as also were cathepsin B&L and sex. Gaping was also impacted by pyridinoline cross-links, together with body mass and maturation. Interestingly, the level of gaping was significantly reduced with a pyridinoline cross-link concentration of >2500 pmols g-1 dry mass. In conclusion, light-manipulation can be used as a tool to improve flesh texture of farmed cod with a low gaping score, but with compromise of increased dress out percentage for the accelerated group. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A total of 1056 singleton fetuses from the Raine Study underwent serial ultrasound biometry (abdominal circumference [AC], head circumference, and femur length) at 18, 24, 28, 34, and 38 weeks gestation. Customized biometry trajectories were developed adjusting for epidemiological influences upon fetal biometry using covariates available at 18 weeks gestation. Prediction accuracy (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] and 95% confidence interval [95%CI]) was evaluated by repeated random sub-sampling cross-validation methodology. Results: The model for derived estimated fetal weight (EFW) performed well for EFW less than 10th predicted percentile (AUC = 0.695, 95%CI, 0.692-0.699) and EFW greater than 90th predicted percentile (AUC = 0.705, 95%CI, 0.702-0.708). Fetal AC was also well predicted for growth restriction (AUC = 0.789, 95%CI, 0.784-0.794) and macrosomia (AUC = 0.796, 95%CI, 0.793-0.799). Population-derived, sex-specific charts misclassified 7.9% of small fetuses and 10.7% of large fetuses as normal. Conversely, 9.2% of those classified as abnormally grown by population-derived charts were considered normal by customized charts, potentially leading to complications of unnecessary intervention. Conclusions: Customized fetal biometric charts may offer improved ability for clinicians to detect deviations from optimal fetal growth and influence pregnancy management. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Biometric trajectories; customization; fetal growth; Raine study","abdominal circumference; adult; Article; body height; controlled study; female; femur; fetal biometry; fetus; fetus growth; fetus monitoring; fetus weight; gestational age; head circumference; human; intrauterine growth retardation; macrosomia; maternal age; predictive value; prenatal period; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; sex difference; anthropometry; fetus development; growth curve; longitudinal study; pregnancy; procedures; young adult; Adult; Anthropometry; Female; Fetal Development; Growth Charts; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Pregnancy; Young Adult"

METHODS: Data was analyzed from 164 patients (206 eyes) with age-related cataracts who underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in our hospital from June 2014 to June 2015. Before surgery, axial length and corneal curvature were measured with IOL Master and combined application of ultrasonic or manual keratometry, respectively. Phacoemulsification and foldable lens implantation were done in the patients. IOL power calculation was carried out using the SRK-II formula with the basis of IOL Master data. The visual acuity and refractive outcome were followed-up for 3mo postoperatively. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the two methods on axial length measurement which was 23.86±1.05 mm by IOL Master and 23.50±0.83 mm by ultrasound (P=0.025). There was also a significant difference between the two methods on corneal curvature measurement which was 44.18±1.35D by IOL Master and 43.70±1.41D by keratometry (P=0.01). The mean absolute error (MAE), at 3mo after operation, was 0.41±0.30D and 0.93±1.10D by the IOL Master and ultrasound groups, respectively, there was a significant difference between the two methods (P=0.027). CONCLUSION: The IOL Master is a non-contact, safe, easy-to-do and patient-friendly methods for axial length and corneal curvature measurement with high accuracy, thus it can calculate the IOL power more accurate and improve the predictive value for postoperative refraction.

This study determined the risk factors for open-angle glaucoma (OAG) in adults examined in the Nigeria National Blindness and Visual Impairment Survey. Methods: A nationally representative sample of 13,591 people aged ≥40 years in 305 clusters in Nigeria were examined (response rate 90.4 %) between January 2005 to June 2007. Everyone had logMAR visual acuity measurement, Frequency Doubling Technology (FDT) visual field testing, autorefraction, A-scan biometry and optic disc assessment. Full ocular examination (n = 6397), included Goldmann applanation tonometry. Values for defining glaucoma using International Society of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology criteria were derived from the study population. Disc images were graded by Moorfields Eye Hospital Reading Centre. Socio-demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity, literacy and place of residence), ocular parameters (intraocular pressure [IOP], axial length and mean ocular perfusion pressure [MOPP]) and systemic parameters (blood pressure, blood glucose and body mass index [BMI]) were assessed for association with OAG. Results: Thirteen thousand eighty-one (96 %) of 13,591 participants had vertical cup:disc ratio measured in at least one eye. 682 eyes of 462 participants were classified as OAG, with 12,738 controls. In univariate analyses the following were associated with OAG: increasing age, male gender, Igbo and Yoruba ethnic groups, illiteracy, longer axial length, higher IOP, lower MOPP, greater severity of hypertension and low BMI (underweight). In multivariate analysis, increasing age (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95 % CI 1.03-1.05), higher IOP (OR 1.22, 95 % CI 1.18-1.25) and Igbo ethnicity (OR 1.73, 95 % CI 1.18-2.56) were independent risk factors for OAG.

These sequestrations account for 1.1-1.8% of all lung resections. Herein we present two clinical cases with a prenatal diagnosis of pulmonary sequestration using ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Pulmonary images indicated a progressive decrease in the size and echogenicity of the lung mass with fetal growth, resulting in asymptomatic neonates with normal chest radiographs. We emphasize the importance of combining imaging examinations with follow-up by a multidisciplinary team working in a center specialized in maternal-fetal medicine. For the successive monitoring of the size of the lung tissue mass, we propose the calculation of the following two biometric ratios that are not yet described in the literature: mass area/head circumference and mass volume/estimated fetal weight.

Methods Singleton pregnancies underwent placental ultrasound within seven days of delivery (n = 87, 29+3-41+5 weeks). Length and width (linear and curvilinear) and depth were estimated. Placental volume (PV) was estimated using 2D ellipse and shell techniques and 3D rotational (15°and 30°rotation angles) and multiplanar (5 and 10 mm slicing intervals) techniques. Measurements were compared to their true correlates following delivery. Intra- and inter-observer reliabilities of candidate placental size estimates were assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results Curvilinear placental length (Rs = 0.24, p = 0.031), width (Rs = 0.27, p = 0.013) and depth (Rs = 0.31, p = 0.0056) correlated well with ex vivo measurements. All methods of PV estimation were related to ex vivo volume (Rs ≥ 0.32, p &lt; 0.01) but not placental weight (p &gt; 0.05); 30°rotational estimation demonstrated the strongest biological correlation (Rs = 0.40, p = 0.0004). Intra- and inter-observer placental size measurements intraclass correlation coefficients were suboptimal (0.59-0.70 and 0.10-0.58 respectively). Discussion We have demonstrated that it is possible to obtain information about the size of the third trimester placenta in utero using 2D and 3D ultrasound. However it is essential that the reliability (particularly interobserver reliability) of these estimates is improved prior to prospective studies to determine their predictive value. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Ellipse; Placental volume; Placental weight; Three-dimensional ultrasound; Tissue density; Two-dimensional ultrasound; VOCAL","adult; Article; biometry; controlled study; correlation coefficient; echography; ex vivo study; female; human; major clinical study; obstetric delivery; parameters concerning the fetus, newborn and pregnancy; placenta length; placenta weight; priority journal; third trimester pregnancy; three dimensional imaging; three dimensional ultrasound; two dimensional ultrasound"

Setting Twelve sites in the United States. Design Prospective cohort study. Methods The eye with the more visually significant cataract was randomized to intraoperative aberrometry measurements (Ocular Response Analyzer with Verifeye) or standard preoperative biometry and use of a toric calculator with the contralateral eye automatically assigned to the other group. The primary effectiveness outcome was the proportion of eyes with a postoperative refractive astigmatism of 0.50 diopter (D) or less at 1 month. Results Of the 130 patients (260 eyes) enrolled, 124 (248 eyes) were randomized; 121 (242 eyes) completed the trial. The percentage of eyes with astigmatism of 0.50 D or less at 1 month was higher in the intraoperative aberrometry group than in the standard group (89.2% versus 76.6%) (P = .006). The mean postoperative refractive astigmatism was lower in the intraoperative aberrometry group (0.29 D ± 0.28 [SD] versus 0.36 ± 0.35 D) (P = .041). Secondary effectiveness endpoints, including manifest refraction spherical equivalent prediction error, uncorrected distance visual acuity, and corrected distance visual acuity, were similar. Conclusions Compared with standard methods, the use of the intraoperative aberrometry system increased the proportion of eyes with postoperative refractive astigmatism of 0.50 D or less and reduced the mean postoperative refractive astigmatism at 1 month.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study of unselected nulliparous women and performed ultrasonic measurement of the fetal abdominal circumference (AC) and head circumference (HC) at 20 and 28 weeks of gestational age (wkGA). Exposures were diagnosis of GDM ≧28 wkGA and maternal obesity. The risk of AC >90th and HC-to-AC ratio <10th percentile was modeled using log-binomial regression, adjusted for maternal characteristics. RESULTS Of 4,069 women, 171 (4.2%) were diagnosed with GDM at ≧28 wkGA. There was no association between fetal biometry at 20 wkGA and subsequent maternal diagnosis of GDM. However, at 28 wkGA, there was an increased risk of AC >90th percentile (adjusted relative risk 2.05 [95% CI 1.37-3.07]) and HC-to-AC ratio <10th percentile (1.97 [1.30-2.99]). Maternal obesity showed similar associations at 28 wkGA (2.04 [1.62-2.56] and 1.46 [1.12-1.90], respectively). The combination of GDM and obesity was associated with an approximately fivefold risk of AC >90th (4.52 [2.98-6.85]) and approximately threefold risk of HC-to-AC ratio <10th percentile (2.80 [1.64-4.78]) at 28 wkGA. Fetal AC >90th percentile at 28 weeks was associated with an approximately fourfold risk of being large for gestational age at birth. CONCLUSIONS Diagnosis of GDM is preceded by excessive growth of the fetal AC between 20 and 28 wkGA, and its effects on fetal growth are additive with the effects of maternal obesity. © 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.",,"abdominal circumference; adult; Article; biometry; cesarean section; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; female; fetal overgrowth; fetus; fetus disease; fetus monitoring; gestational age; head circumference; high risk pregnancy; human; labor induction; large for gestational age; major clinical study; maternal obesity; nullipara; oral glucose tolerance test; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; prospective study; risk assessment; young adult"

Design: Prospective cohort study. Subjects: 50 consecutive adult patients, 40–60 years of age, having primary angle closure. Methods: Clinical examination, perimetry, biometry and ultrasound biomicroscopy of the angle were done. A darkroom prone provocative test (DRPPT), a mydriatic test and a Valsalva maneuver were performed before and after the iridotomy. Main outcome measures: IOP change in response to the provocative tests before and after iridotomy, and correlation with baseline parameters. Results: IOP at baseline and after iridotomy was 14.4 ± 2.7 mmHg and 14.3 ± 2.6 mmHg, respectively (p = 0.)83. There was no significant change on diurnal phasing before and after an iridotomy (p = 0.)11. The mean IOP rise was 5.9 ± 3.7 mmHg on the DRPPT, 4.3 ± 3.5 mmHg on the Mydriatic test and 9.1 ± 4.9 mmHg on the Valsalva maneuver, and was reduced significantly to 3.2 ± 2.1 mmHg, 2.3 ± 1.8 and 6.4 ± 3.5, respectively(p < 0.001 for all tests). The decrease in pupillary block component for all 50 eyes was 46.5 % for the mydriatic test, 45.8 % for the DRPPT and 29.7 % for the Valsalva maneuver. PAC eyes positive on the DRPPT and mydriatic test prior to an iridotomy became negative after laser iridotomy in 75.9 and 84.6 % eyes, respectively, but on the Valsalva maneuver, only 23.8 % became negative. After iridotomy, eyes that continued to be positive on the mydriatic test had a significantly thicker lens (p = 0.02), decreased TCPD (p = 0.014) and narrower trabecular–iris angle (p = 0.048). On the DRPPT, they had a thicker lens (p = 0.03), shorter iris thickness (p = 0.025) and TCPD (p = 0.032), and on the Valsalva maneuver, they had a narrower scleral–ciliary process angle (SCPA; p = 0.019) and shorter TCPD (p = 0.015). Conclusions: This comprehensive functional evaluation of laser iridotomy in early PAC eyes showed a significant reduction in the pupillary block component of IOP response to provocative testing, possibly decreasing IOP fluctuations over time. An iridotomy does not, however, significantly change mean IOP or diurnal phasing of IOP in PAC eyes. Eyes with a very narrow angle or a thick lens may continue to have angle closure due to other pathomechanisms for angle closure. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Functional evaluation; Laser iridotomy; PAC; Pupillary block component","acoustic microscopy; adult; biometry; cohort analysis; female; Glaucoma, Angle-Closure; gonioscopy; human; intraocular pressure; iridectomy; iris; low level laser therapy; male; middle aged; oculoplethysmography; pathophysiology; perimetry; physiology; prospective study; pupil disease; solid state laser; therapeutic use; Valsalva maneuver; Adult; Biometry; Cohort Studies; Female; Glaucoma, Angle-Closure; Gonioscopy; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Iridectomy; Iris; Laser Therapy; Lasers, Solid-State; Male; Microscopy, Acoustic; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Pupil Disorders; Tonometry, Ocular; Valsalva Maneuver; Visual Field Tests"

The measurement of nuchal translucency (NT) allows the risk calculation for the fetal trisomies 21, 18 and 13 but also gives information on those fetal chromosomal defects which are at present unable to be detected using cffDNA. Nuchal translucency is the only auditable parameter at 11-13+6 weeks and gives thus information on the quality of the first trimester anomaly scan. In addition it gives indirect information on the risks for fetal defects and for cardiac anomalies. Also the chances for a healthy live baby can be estimated. As experience with first trimester anomaly scanning increases, and the resolution of the ultrasound equipment has increased substantially, more and more details of the fetal anatomy become accessible at the first trimester scan. Therefore fetal anatomical defects and complex anomalies have become amenable to examination in the first trimester.

Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted of ultrasonography examinations from women with singleton pregnancies with a confirmed diagnosis of T21 who sought care at an academic tertiary-care center in the USA between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2013. Growth curves were constructed using linear regression and compared with the Hadlock standard. Results The study included 425 ultrasonography examinations from 235 women. The head circumference and femur length were smaller than the reference standards at all gestational ages (head circumference: P = 0.017; femur length: P < 0.001). The abdominal circumference was larger than the reference standard from 29 weeks onward (P < 0.001). The biparietal diameter was smaller in the second trimester and in the late third trimester (P < 0.001). The overall estimated fetal weight was not different from the reference standard. Conclusion The T21-specific growth curves indicate anthropometric differences between T21 fetuses and the general population.

Box 19063, Tygerberg, South Africa","Purpose: There is an ongoing search for new drugs and drug targets to treat diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Both obesity and T2D are characterized by the development of a cardiomyopathy associated with increased hypertension and compensatory left ventricular hypertrophy. Small, specific glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitors were developed to replace lithium chloride for use in psychiatric disorders. In addition, they were advocated as treatment for T2D since GSK-3 inhibition improves blood glucose handling. However, GSK-3 is a regulator of hypertrophic signalling in the heart via phosphorylation of NFATc3 and β-catenin respectively. In view of this, we hypothesized that chronic inhibition of GSK-3 will induce myocardial hypertrophy or exacerbate existing hypertrophy. Methods: Rats with obesity-induced prediabetes were treated orally with GSK-3 inhibitor (CHIR118637 (CT20026)), 30 mg/kg/day for the last 8 weeks of a 20-week diet high in sugar content vs a control diet. Biometric and biochemical parameters were measured, echocardiography performed and localization and co-localization of NFATc3 and GATA4 determined in cardiomyocytes. Results: Obesity initiated myocardial hypertrophy, evidenced by increased ventricular mass (1.158 ± 0.029 vs 0.983 ± 0.03 g) and enlarged cardiomyocytes (18.86 ± 2.25 vs 14.92 ± 0.50um2) in association with increased end-diastolic diameter (EDD = 8.48 ± 0.11 vs 8.15 ± 0.10 mm). GSK-3 inhibition (i) increased ventricular mass only in controls (1.075 ± 0.022 g) and (ii) EDD in both groups (controls: 8.63 ± 0.07; obese: 8.72 ± 0.15 mm) (iii) localized NFATc3 and GATA4 peri-nuclearly. Conclusion: Indications of onset of myocardial hypertrophy in both control and obese rats treated with a GSK-3 inhibitor were found. It remains speculation whether these changes were adaptive or maladaptive. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cardiac hypertrophy; GATA4; GSK-3; NFATc3; Pre-diabetes","glycogen synthase kinase 3; glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor; transcription factor GATA 4; transcription factor NFAT3; antidiabetic agent; Gata4 protein, rat; glucose blood level; glycogen synthase kinase 3; insulin; transcription factor GATA 4; transcription factor NF-AT c3; transcription factor NFAT; animal experiment; animal model; Article; biochemical analysis; biometry; cardiac muscle cell; cardiovascular parameters; controlled study; diabetic obesity; disease exacerbation; echocardiography; enzyme inhibition; heart ventricle hypertrophy; heart ventricle remodeling; impaired glucose tolerance; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; treatment duration; analysis; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; blood; cardiomegaly; cell size; complication; diabetes mellitus; Diabetic Cardiomyopathies; diagnostic imaging; drug effects; glucose blood level; heart; metabolism; obesity; pathology; Wistar rat; Animals; Blood Glucose; Cardiomegaly; Cell Size; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Cardiomyopathies; Echocardiography; GATA4 Transcription Factor; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3; Heart; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Male; Myocytes, Cardiac; NFATC Transcription Factors; Obesity; Rats, Wistar"

However, the roles of Id during lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) progression remain unclear. Eighty-eight ADC samples were evaluated for Id-1,2,3 level and angiogenesis (CD 34 and VEGF microvessel density) by immunohistochemistry and morphometry. The impact of these markers was tested on follow-up until death or recurrence. A significant difference between tumor and normal tissue was found for Id-1,2,3 expression (P &lt; 0.01). In addition, high levels of nuclear Id-1 were associated with higher angiogenesis in the tumor stroma (P &lt; 0.01). Equally significant was the association between patients in T1-stage and low cytoplasmic Id-2, as well as patients in stage-IIb and low Id-3. High cytoplasm Id-3 expression was also directly associated to lymph nodes metastasis (P = 0.05). Patients at stages I to III, with low Id-1 and Id-3 cytoplasm histoscores showed significant long metastasis-free survival time than those with high Id-1 or Id-3 expression (P = 0.04). Furthermore, high MVD-CD34 and MVD-VEGF expression were associated with short recurrence-free survival compared to low MVD-CD34 and MVD-VEGF expressions (P = 0.04). Cox model analyses controlled for age, lymph node metastasis, and adjuvant treatments showed that nuclear Id-1, cytoplasmic Id-3, and MVD-CD34 were significantly associated with survival time.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out from January 2014 to January 2016; 1004 normal pregnant women, in different gestational ages, were evaluated, and the mentioned structures, previously standardized, were measured. The statistical analysis was performed with the FOSS PAST 3.04 for the organization of the data at each gestational age, in percentiles. They arose in graphic type nomograms and first-order polynomial regression model. Each graphic was evaluated with statistics significance with P < 0.05. Results: The intracranial structures could be measured entirely in 864 cases (86% of the tests). Biparietal diameter and head circumferences were obtained in all cases; it was observed a directly proportional growth to gestational age (P < 0.05). The measurement of the ventricular Atrium was stable throughout the pregnancy. Measures of the cisterna magna, cavum septum pellucidum and of the lateral ventricles are represented. Conclusions: Normal ranges are represented in tables for correct clinical use and research, the results are not different from previous research conducted in other countries. Usable reference values, in the prenatal consultation, through non-Gaussian statistics are presented.

In addition, we also implement a dialogue model between the two homunculus agents. The dialogue models show the necessity of both exchange of information and observation of object.

After weaning, some of the rats had five sessions per week of a 30-min treadmill walking (CE and SE), while the others remained sedentary (CS and SS) until the age of 120 days. Exercise caused a reduction of body weight (CS/CE = 1.18), Lee index (CS/CE = 1.04), fasting blood glucose (CS/CE = 1.35), mesenteric (CS/CE = 1.23), and ovarian fat (CS/CE = 1.33) in CE, but only glucose was decreased in SE (SS/SE = 1.16). The diameter of adipocytes decreased to a half in the small-litter groups. Exercise increased subcutaneous (CS/CE = 0.88 and SS/SE = 0.71), but decreased retroperitoneal adipocytes (CS/ CE = 1.2 and SS/SE = 1.3). Litter size reduction had little impact on females at the age of 120 days, but the light physical activity seemed insufficient to counteract all the effects of lactational overfeeding. On the other hand, pups from exercised mothers had a decrease in their biometric and glycemic indexes, demonstrating the transgenerational action of regular, although light, exercise. © 2016 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.","Adipocyte; Blood glucose; Exercise; Obesity; Small litter","cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; biometry; body composition; body mass; body weight; controlled study; exhaustion; female; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance test; glycemic index; insulin tolerance test; lactate blood level; lactation; mesenteric fat; metabolism; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; obesity; overnutrition; physical activity; sitting; treadmill exercise; treadmill walking"

This is the first report on allometric size-scaling of excretion and metabolic (both routine and standard) rates in this species. No evidences of differences in size exponent were found between physiological rates or between both populations for any physiological rate. Intercepts of regression lines were significantly higher in subtidal than in intertidal mussels, indicating greater levels of energy expenditure in the former. However, metabolic scope for feeding and growth was about two-fold in intertidal mussels, pointing to a reduced growth efficiency compared with subtidal mussels. Evolution of biometric parameters of body components with size indicated that subtidal mussels allocated energy resources preferably into flesh growth, achieving higher condition indices, while intertidal mussels put more effort on shell calcification and thickening which resulted in heavier shells of reduced organic content. These differentiated growth “strategies” of both populations could be related to their differences in growth efficiencies. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Allometric relationships; Ammonia excretion rates; Biometric parameters; Metabolic scope for feeding and growth (MSFG); Mytilus; Routine and standard metabolic rates","allometry; ammonia; biometry; bivalve; calcification; comparative study; energy resource; excretion; shell; Mytilus; Mytilus galloprovincialis"

But the durable salience of this article is perplexing, as its critique was misdirected (it should have been aimed at the craniometrics of the early twentieth century, not merely the roentgenographic extension used in the orthodontic clinic) and its proposed remedies have all failed to establish themselves as methods of any broad utility. When problems highlighted by Moyers and me have been resolved at all, the innovations that resolved them owe to tools very different from those suggested in our article and imported from fields quite a bit farther from biometrics than we expected back in 1979. One of these tools was the creation de novo of a new abstract mathematical construction, statistical shape space, in the 1980s and 1990s; another was a flexible and intuitive new graphic, the thin-plate spline, for meaningfully and suggestively visualizing a wide variety of biological findings in these spaces. On the other hand, many of the complaints Moyers and I enunciated back in 1979, especially those stemming from the disarticulation of morphometrics from the explanatory styles and purposes of clinical medicine, remain unanswered even today. The present essay, a retrospective historical meditation, reviews the context of the 1979 publication, its major themes, and its relevance today. This essay is dedicated to the memory of Robert E. Moyers on the 100th anniversary of the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics. © 2016 American Association of Orthodontists.",,"biometry; clinical medicine; craniometry; disarticulation; meditation; memory; orthodontics; orthopedics; publication; scientific literature; cephalometry; history; human; standards; Cephalometry; History, 20th Century; Humans"

Methods The population-based cross-sectional Beijing Eye Study 2011 included 3468 individuals (age: 64.6 ± 9.8 years; range: 50-93 years), who underwent enhanced depth imaging of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). CSC was defined as serous detachment of the retina in the macular region without signs of haemorrhages or signs of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, exudative age-related macular degeneration or other retinal vascular disorders, both on fundus photographs and on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Results Central serous chorioretinopathy was diagnosed in 10 eyes (prevalence rate: 0.15 ± 0.05%; 95% confidence interval (CI):0.06%, 0.25%) of 10 subjects (prevalence rate: 0.31 ± 0.10%; 95% CI: 0.12%, 0.50%). In five subjects, CSC was located foveally, and in five subjects, CSC was located extrafoveally. All subjects affected by foveal CSC were men, and three of the five individuals with extrafoveal CSC were men. In univariate analysis, subjects with CSC were significantly younger than the remaining study participants, and foveal CSC showed a significant (p = 0.02) predilection for men. After adjusting for age and gender, individuals with foveal CSC (383 ± 112 μm versus 270 ± 47 μm; p = 0.02) and the whole group of subjects with CSC had a significantly thicker subfoveal choroid. In a parallel manner, eyes contralateral to eyes with foveal CSC showed a significantly thicker subfoveal choroid than the age-adjusted control group (413 ± 74 μm versus 270 ± 47 μm; p = 0.001). Conclusions In Chinese aged 50+ years, the prevalence of CSC was 0.14% per subject. The choroid in the CSC affected eyes and in the contralateral unaffected eyes was significantly thicker than in an age- and gender-adjusted control population-based group. © 2016 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

Complutense 30, Madrid, Spain","This paper explores the feasibility of a contactless identification system based on hand features. The identification solution has been designed to be integrated with smart space applications and relies on a commercial 3D sensor (i.e., Leap Motion) for palm features capture. The first part of the paper is devoted to evaluate the significance of the different hand features and the performance of a set of classification algorithms. 21 users have contributed to build a testing dataset; for each user, the morphology of each hand has been gathered from 52 features, which include bones length and width, palm characteristics and relative distances among fingers, palm center and wrist. In order to get consistent samples and guarantee the best performance for Leap Motion device, the data collection system provides sweet spot control. This functionality guides the user to situate the hand in the best position and orientation with respect to the device. The selected classification strategies—nearest neighbor (NN), supported vector machine, multilayer perceptron, logistic regression and tree algorithms—have been evaluated on Weka. We have found that relative hand-pose distances are more significant than pure morphological features. On this feature set, the highest correct classified instances (CCI) rate is reached through the multilayer perceptron algorithm (>96 %), although all the evaluated classifiers provide a CCI rate above 90 %. The analysis also gather how these algorithms perform with a variable number of users in the database, and what the sensitivity to the number of training samples is for each algorithm. Results show that there are different alternatives that are accurate enough for non-critical, immediate response applications. The second part of the paper focuses on the implementation of application examples that are integrated with a real-time hand-based identification system using NN. In particular, the applications enable customization and gesture-based control of the smart space. A five-user study has provided insight into the system performance and user experience. Results confirm the viability of using in-air hand shape recognition in smart space settings, although also it is still needed to deal with aspects that hinder faster and more accurate recognition. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biometry; Classification; Gesture-based interaction; Hand-shape based identification; Smart spaces","Algorithms; Classification (of information); Multilayers; Space applications; Statistical tests; Biometry; Gesture-based interaction; Hand shape; Hand-based identification; Smart space; Smart space applications; Supported vector machines; Variable number of users; Palmprint recognition"

The termination of the thoracic duct occurred on the confluence between the left internal jugular vein and the left subclavian vein in 60 % of the individuals. The average results for the biometric measurements were: distance between the end of left internal jugular vein and omohyoid muscle 31.2 ± 2.7 mm; distance between the end of thoracic duct and the left internal jugular vein 0.0 ± 0.0 mm; distance between the end of thoracic duct and the left subclavian vein 3.6 ± 1.0 mm; distance between the end of thoracic duct and the left brachiocephalic vein 10.7 ± 3.1 mm. Moreover, it was identified that the left internal jugular vein length in level IV, measured between its entrance in the left subclavian vein and the omohyoid muscle, was able to predict the termination of the thoracic duct on the junction between the left internal jugular vein and the left subclavian vein (OR = 2.99) with high accuracy (79.3 %). In addition, the left internal jugular vein length at level IV was able to predict the localization of thoracic duct termination. Thus, this finding has practical value in minimizing the risk for a potential chyle leak during or after a left-sided neck dissection. © 2015, Japanese Association of Anatomists.","Anatomic variation; Anatomy; Neck dissection; Surgery; Thoracic duct","aged; anatomical variation; Article; biometry; body mass; brachiocephalic vein; cadaver; comparative study; controlled study; female; human; human tissue; hyoid bone; internal jugular vein; left internal jugular vein; left subclavian vein; male; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; subclavian vein; thoracic duct; anatomical variation; anatomy and histology; biometry; jugular vein; neck; neck dissection; Postoperative Complications; procedures; subclavian vein; thoracic duct; Anatomic Variation; Biometry; Brachiocephalic Veins; Cadaver; Female; Humans; Jugular Veins; Male; Neck; Neck Dissection; Postoperative Complications; Subclavian Vein; Thoracic Duct"

Design Prospective interventional study. Methods In this clinic-based study, 52 eyes of 52 patients with resolved APAC attack who underwent LPI were enrolled. Subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examination and AS-OCT imaging before and 6 weeks after LPI. Anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber area (ACA), iris thickness (IT), iris area, iris curvature, lens vault (LV), anterior vault, angle opening distance (AOD500, AOD750), and trabecular iris space area (TISA500, TISA750) were measured in qualified images and compared before and after LPI. A linear mixed-model analysis was performed for potential predictors of change in AOD750. Main outcome measure was change in AOD750 after LPI. Results The mean age of participants was 60.7 ± 9.2 years. Mean angle width (Shaffer grade) changed from 0.25 ± 0.34 at baseline to 1.22 ± 0.86 after LPI (P <.001). However, 25 nasal angles (48.0%) and 28 temporal angles (53%) had iridotrabecular contact after LPI. All angle parameters (AOD500, AOD750, TISA500, TISA750; P ≤.03), ACD (P =.001), and ACA (P <.001) increased significantly after LPI. Iris curvature and LV were reduced (P =.01 for both) after LPI, but there was no significant change in IT and iris area. After multivariate analysis, pre-LPI AOD750 was the only factor associated with change in AOD750 (β = -0.992, P =.02). Exaggerated LV, defined as LV greater than one-third of the anterior vault (sum of LV and ACD), was present in 61.5% of the cases (32 eyes). The extent of change in angle parameters was not significantly different between groups with and without exaggerated LV after LPI. Conclusion This study confirms that LPI results in a significant increase in the angle width, ACD, and ACA as well as flattening of the iris in APAC eyes. The extent of angle deepening is inversely related to baseline angle width. The lens shifts posteriorly after resolution of attack, especially in those with greater lens vault. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It supposedly affected the composition of the marine biosphere, including the primary producers. This study aims at using the size evolution of three species of coccolithophores (Biscutum constans, Zeugrhabdotus erectus and Watznaueria barnesiae) for better understanding the impact of the OAE 1a on primary producers. A total of 30 samples derived from three sites, which cover the upper Barremian-lower Aptian interval, have been analyzed from the North Sea and the Lower Saxony Basin. The sections expose near-shore and shallow marine sediments.The measured data of B. constans and Z. erectus are characterized by a size decrease synchronous to the negative carbon isotope excursion. This size reduction marks the early phase of the OAE 1a, more precisely the carbon isotope segment C3. Coccolith sizes recover to pre-OAE 1a values in the aftermath of this brief interval. The short termed size reduction is seen as a reaction of specific nannofossil taxa to an increase in humidity during the early phase of OAE 1a. Due to high weathering rates and a substantial run-off, the amount of detrital material transported into the marine system increased significantly. Consequently light availability diminished in the surface waters, causing habitat changes for the photoautotrophic primary producers. Light-sensitive species like B. constans and Z. erectus adjusted by forming smaller skeletons, thereby reducing their size. This strategy allowed for dwelling in shallower water depth and thus compensated for the decrease in sun light. The sizes of W. barnesiae in contrast remain stable throughout the entire OAE 1a interval. W. barnesiae was not affected by these environmental shifts and is thus interpreted as being robust with respect to changes of the sun light. © 2016.","Aptian; Barremian; Biometry; Calcareous nannofossils; Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (OAE 1a)","Aptian; biometry; calcareous alga; coccolith; marine ecosystem; nanofossil; paleobotany; taxonomy; Atlantic Ocean; Lower Saxony Basin; North German Basin; North Sea; Biscutum constans; Haptophyceae; Watznaueria; Zeugrhabdotus erectus"

The characterisation and differentiation of Fasciola populations is crucial to control the disease, given the different transmission, epidemiology and pathology characteristics of the two species. Lineal biometric features of adult liver flukes infecting livestock have been studied to characterise and discriminate fasciolids from Bangladesh. An accurate analysis was conducted to phenotypically discriminate between fasciolids from naturally infected bovines (cattle, buffaloes) throughout the country. Morphometric analyses were made with a computer image analysis system (CIAS) applied on the basis of standardised measurements and the logistic model of the body growth and development of fasciolids in the different host groups. Since it is the first ever comprehensive study of this kind undertaken in Bangladesh, the results are compared to pure fasciolid populations of F. hepatica from the European Mediterranean area and F. gigantica from Burkina Faso, geographical areas where both species do not co-exist. Principal component analysis showed that the biometric characteristics of fasciolids from Bangladesh are situated between F. hepatica and F. gigantica standard populations, indicating the presence of phenotypes of intermediate forms in Bangladesh. These results are analysed by considering the present emergence of animal fascioliasis, the local lymnaeid fauna, the impact of climate change, and the risk of human infection in the country. © W.

Weight-bearing limb bones in these species have geometries that enable them to withstand deformations due to loading, both within and between species. Departures from the expected scaling of bone size and shape to body mass occur in mammals that have become specialized for different types of locomotion. For example, mammals adapted for frequent running and jumping behaviors have hind limb bones that are long in relation to body mass, but with narrower cross-sections than predicted for their length. The Longshanks mouse was recently established, a selectively bred line of mice with ~12-13% longer tibiae relative to body mass. This increased limb length resembles superficially the derived limb proportions of rodents adapted for hopping and jumping. Here, 3D geometric morphometrics and analyses of bone cross-sectional geometry were combined to determine whether selection for increased relative tibia length in Longshanks mice has altered the scaling relationship of size and shape, and/or bone robusticity, relative to the tibiae of random-bred control mice from the same genetic background. The results suggest that the Longshanks tibia is not a geometrically scaled version of the control tibiae. Instead, the Longshanks tibia has become narrower in cross-section in relation to its increased length, leading to a decrease in overall bending strength when compared with control tibiae. These changes in bone shape and robusticity resemble the derived morphology of mammals adapted for running and jumping, with important implications for the material properties and strength of bone in these mammals. © 2016 Anatomical Society.","Allometry; Artificial selection; Geometric morphometrics; Locomotion; Longshanks mouse; Robusticity; Terrestrial mammals; Tibia shape","anatomic landmark; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; artificial selection; bone length; bone structure; breeding; controlled study; female; genetic background; geometry; male; measurement error; micro-computed tomography; morphology; morphometrics; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; reliability; three dimensional imaging; tibia; anatomy and histology; animal; biometry; growth, development and aging; selective breeding; tibia; Animals; Biometry; Female; Male; Mice; Selective Breeding; Tibia"

Serum specimens were detected by methods as Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA), chemiluminescent microparticle immune assay (CMIA), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), emulsion method (TP-AD) and toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST). Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated on five methods. Titers of syphilis antibody in different stages and pre/post on treatment among syphilis patients were compared and analyzed under the five methods.RESULTS: The sensitivity vs. specificity of TPPA, CMIA, ELISA, TP-AD and TRUST appeared as 100.00% vs. 99.50%, 99.38% vs. 99.00%, 98.12% vs. 99.00%, 94.38% vs. 94.50% and 85.62% vs. 95.50%, respectively. Among the patients at primary or latent stages, the syphilis antibody positive rate detected by TRUST appeared lower than that detected by ELISA, TPPA, CMIA or TP-AD, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.01). There were no statistical differences in the syphilis antibody positive rate of syphilis patients in the secondary or tertiary stages detected by five methods (P>0.05). In each stage of the syphilis patients, the syphilis antibody positive rate detected by ELISA or of CMIA combined with TRUST both reached 100.00%. Before and after treatment in 121 cases of confirmed syphilis, there was statistically significant difference in the syphilis antibody positive rate detected by TRUST method (P<0.05). There was no statistical significance in the syphilis antibody positive rate detected by other four methods (P>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and specificity of TPPA, CMIA and ELISA methods were better. METHODS as ELISA or as CMIA combined with TRUST both appeared reliable for syphilis screening in every stage of the disease.

Reintroducing captive-reared Chinese giant salamanders may help to augment the declining wild populations and conserve this critically endangered amphibian. We released 31 captive-reared juvenile giant salamanders implanted with VHF radio transmitters at the Heihe River (n = 15) and the Donghe River (n = 16) in the Qinling Mountains of central China. Salamanders were monitored every day for survival from April 28th 2013 to September 3rd 2014. We attempted to recapture all living individuals by the end of the study, measured their body mass and total body length, and checked for abnormalities and presence of external parasites. Two salamanders at the Heihe River and 10 animals at the Donghe River survived through the project timeline. Nine salamanders were confirmed dead, while the status of the other 10 animals was undetermined. The annual survival rate of giant salamanders at the Donghe River (0.702) was 1.7-fold higher than that at the Heihe River (0.405). Survival increased as individuals were held longer following surgery, whereas body mass did not have a significant impact on survival rate. All salamanders recaptured from the Donghe River (n = 8) increased in mass (0.50 ± 0.13 kg) and length (5.5 ± 1.5 cm) after approximately 11 months in the wild, and they were only 7% lighter than wild animals of the same length (mean residual = -0.033 ± 0.025). Our results indicate that captive-reared Chinese giant salamanders can survive in the wild one year after release and adequate surgical recovery time is extremely important to postrelease survival. Future projects may reintroduce older juveniles to achieve better survival and longer monitoring duration. © 2016 Zhang et al.

Study Design and Setting We obtained all 1,028,786 articles from the PubMed Central Open-Access archive (retrieved May 9, 2015). We focused on 113,450 medical research articles. A Delphi panel identified 177 statistical/epidemiological methods pertinent to clinical researchers. We used a text-mining approach to determine if a specific statistical/epidemiological method was encountered in a given article. We report the proportion of articles using a specific method for the entire cross-sectional sample and also stratified into three blocks of time (1995-2005; 2006-2010; 2011-2015). Results Numeric descriptive statistics were commonplace (96.4% articles). Other frequently encountered methods groups included statistical inferential concepts (52.9% articles), epidemiological measures of association (53.5% articles) methods for diagnostic/classification accuracy (40.1% articles), hypothesis testing (28.8% articles), ANOVA (23.2% articles), and regression (22.6% articles). We observed relative percent increases in the use of: regression (103.0%), missing data methods (217.9%), survival analysis (147.6%), and correlated data analysis (192.2%).

However, a factor often disregarded in empirical studies is the presence and the extent of measurement error. This is potentially a very serious issue because random measurement error can inflate the amount of variance and, since many statistical analyses are based on the amount of “explained” relative to “residual” variance, can result in loss of statistical power. On the other hand, systematic bias can affect statistical analyses by biasing the results (i.e. variation due to bias is incorporated in the analysis and treated as biologically-meaningful variation). Here, I briefly review common sources of error in geometric morphometrics. I then review the most commonly used methods to measure and account for both random and non-random measurement error, providing a worked example using a real dataset. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bias; Geometric morphometrics; Measurement error; Multivariate analysis","analysis of variance; computer program; correlation coefficient; geometric morphometric; measurement accuracy; measurement error; morphology; morphometrics; nonhuman; principal component analysis; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Review; sample size; statistical analysis; statistical bias; variance; anatomy; biometry; body size; methodology; procedures; Analysis of Variance; Anatomy; Biometry; Body Size; Research Design"

Remote authentication might be in the form of encrypted information. Intruder attacks such as Trojan Horse may cause serious issues especially in the case of remote operations. In this paper, a robust authentication technique is proposed, which is based on segmentation, symmetric encryption and data hiding. If a user wants to be remotely authenticated, initially user has to select a video. Next, user’s biometric signal is encrypted using a symmetric encryption method. Then the encrypted image is vectorized and the data hiding process is carried out using Qualified Significant Wavelet Trees (QSWTs). QSWT is used to achieve the invisibility, resistance to attacks and robustness in data hiding. Subsequently, the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is applied to retrieve the hidden information from the stego-object followed by an appropriate decryption process to get back the biometric image. Experimental results prove that the proposed technique would yield security merits and robustness to steganalytic attacks. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

Morpho-structural observations showed that the cuspidata flower is very similar to the europaea one. Nevertheless, some biometric parameters (length of pollen, pistil, ovule, and embryo sac) significantly differed between the two subspecies. Furthermore, numerous and interesting differences were observed between Asian and African cuspidata accessions for the morphology of stigma papillate cells, degree of secondary cell wall thickenings of the endothecial cells, persistence of the tapetum, ovule and embryo sac length. At functional level, main differences were in the synchrony/asynchrony of the microsporogenesis, percentage of male meiotic abnormalities and sterile pollen, development of ovules.

This study characterized FAP via proteomics and verified associations of these proteins with feed efficiency, body composition and fertility-related measures in yearling beef bulls. Assessments including testicular ultrasonography, infrared thermography, seminal quality, seminal plasma proteomics, carcass composition, and reproductive organ biometry were obtained. From a population of 31 bulls, the seven most and least feed efficient (efficient, inefficient) bulls were used for categorical comparisons. Correlations between FAP, productive performance and fertility-related measures were determined. These traits were also correlated with orthogonal factors summarized from the FAP. Efficient bulls had increased epididymal sperm-binding protein-1 and decreased concentration of protein-C inhibitor compared to inefficient bulls. Correlations between FAP with age, body size, body composition, reproductive organ biometry, scrotal temperature, and seminiferous tubule maturity are reported. Acrosin and cathepsin D increased with development of the testes and osteopontin increased with greater numbers of mature seminiferous tubules. Phosphoglycerate kinase-2 was higher in animals with a higher scrotum temperature and a higher prevalence of sperm morphology defects. The principal factor indicated that FAP variability concentrations were positively correlated with age, reproductive organ biometry, body size and composition. Our results indicate that FAP changes with body size and sexual development, and demonstrates differences in the proteomics of bulls with diverging feed efficiency. This is related to the delay in the sexual maturity of efficient young bulls. © 2016 Society for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.","Epididymal sperm-binding protein 1; Osteopontin; Residual feed intake; Sexual maturity; Testicular pixel intensity","seminal plasma protein; animal; body composition; bovine; diagnostic imaging; eating; echography; fertility; male; metabolism; physiology; proteomics; sperm; testis; Animals; Body Composition; Cattle; Eating; Fertility; Male; Proteomics; Semen; Seminal Plasma Proteins; Testis; Ultrasonography"

Maternal Zika virus infection has been associated with fetal microcephaly and severe cerebral damage. Objective: To analyze the MRI cerebral findings in fetuses with intrauterine Zika virus infection. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data. Inclusion criteria comprised cases with (1) estimated conception date between June 2013 and May 2014, (2) available US and MRI scans revealing severe fetal brain lesions and (3) positive polymerase chain reaction for Zika virus in the amniotic fluid. We recorded pregnancy history of Zika virus infection and analyzed US and MRI scans. Results: Three out of 12 cases of severe cerebral lesions fulfilled all inclusion criteria. History of maternal Zika virus infection had been documented in two cases. Calcifications and ventriculomegaly were present at US in all cases. MRI showed micrencephaly (n = 3), low cerebellar biometry (n = 2), occipital subependymal pseudocysts (n = 2), polymicrogyria with laminar necrosis and opercular dysplasia (n = 3), absent (n = 1) or hypoplastic (n = 1) corpus callosum and hypoplastic brainstem (n = 1). Conclusion: Severe cerebral damage was observed in our series, with indirect findings suggesting that the germinal matrix is the principal target for Zika virus.

Central corneal thickness, corneal endothelial cell density, hexagonality of corneal endothelial cells, and cell area of corneal endothelial cells were measured using specular microscopy. Axial length was measured using ultrasound biometry. 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and malondialdehyde levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.RESULTS: 8-OHdG level was lower in the aqueous humor of myopic patients than in that of control group (p = 0.014) and was positively correlated with central corneal thickness and negatively correlated with axial length (r = 0.511, p = 0.02; r = -0.382, p < 0.001).

This may be due partially to differences in pelvic floor structure and functional anatomy. To date, data on this issue are sparse. The aim of this study was to compare hiatal dimensions, pelvic organ descent and levator biometry in young, healthy nulliparous Caucasian and African women. Methods Healthy nulliparous non-pregnant volunteers attending a local nursing school in Uganda were invited to participate in this study during two fistula camps. All volunteers underwent a simple physician-administered questionnaire and a four-dimensional translabial ultrasound examination. Offline analysis was performed to assess hiatal dimensions, pelvic organ descent, levator muscle thickness and area. To compare findings with those obtained in nulliparous non-pregnant Caucasians, we retrieved the three-dimensional/four-dimensional ultrasound volume datasets of a previously published study. Results The dataset of 76 Ugandan and 49 Caucasian women was analyzed. The two groups were not matched but they were comparable in age and body mass index. All measurements of hiatal dimensions and pelvic organ descent were significantly higher among the Ugandans (all P ≤ 0.01); however, muscle thickness and area were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions Substantial differences between Caucasian and Ugandan non-pregnant nulliparae were identified in this study comparing functional pelvic floor anatomy. It appears likely that these differences in functional anatomy are at least partly genetic in nature. © 2015 ISUOG.

Materials and Methods: Twenty-five eyes of 25 patients with POAG and 29 eyes of 29 patients with PXG who had uncomplicated phacoemulsification and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation surgery were included to our prospective study. Central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and axial length (AL) were measured with an optical biometer preoperatively and at 1 month postoperatively. The pre- and postoperative values of intraocular pressure (IOP) and the anterior segment parameters and the differences between POAG and PXG were compared statistically by paired t, independent t and chi-square tests. Results: The mean values of preoperative CCT (p=0.042) and ACD (p=0.012) were significantly lower in the PXG than in the POAG group. In the PXG group, IOP decreased (p=0.001) but CCT (p=0.03) and ACD (p=0.001) increased significantly postoperatively; AL did not change significantly. In the POAG group, IOP decreased (p=0.01) and ACD (p=0.004) increased significantly postoperatively, while AL and CCT did not change significantly. There were no significant differences in the pre- to postoperative changes in IOP (p=0.76), AL (p=0.44) and CCT (p=0.52) values between the two groups. However, the postoperative increase in ACD was larger in the PXG group (p=0.03).

The calculated power of an imaginary IOL from the study devices fell within 0.28 diopter of one another (P >.05). Conclusions The image-guided system compared well with and provided astigmatism measurements similar to those of currently available diagnostic measurement devices. This system can aid appropriate preoperative IOL power calculations. Financial Disclosures Drs.

Methods: In this prospective study, 38 eyes of 38 patients having phacoemulsification surgery were included. All patients underwent detailed ophthalmologic examination, including preoperative axial length (AXL) measurement with optical biometry and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement preoperatively and 1 month postoperatively. The CT was measured perpendicularly at the fovea and 1.5 mm temporal, 3.0 mm temporal, 1.5 mm nasal, and 3.0 mm nasal using SD-OCT preoperatively and 1 month postoperatively. Changes in the CT after surgery and correlation of this change with age, AXL, preoperative IOP, and IOP change were evaluated. Results: There was a statistically significant increase in the CT at all regions evaluated. This increment was more prominent in the nasal and subfoveal regions. The IOP decreased significantly 1 month after surgery (16.14±4.94 mmHg vs 13.91±4.86 mmHg; P < 0.001). The change in IOP was correlated with the CT changes at all regions, whereas age, AXL, and preoperative IOP had no significant correlations with the changes in CT. Conclusion: Phacoemulsification surgery may cause significant increase in CT, which is correlated with surgery-induced IOP change in the short term. Long-term follow-up of eyes having phacoemulsification surgery may provide further insight into the effects of cataract surgery on the choroid. © 2016 Aslan Bayhan et al.","Choroidal thickness; Optical coherence tomography; Phacoemulsification",

METHODS: This retrospective case-control study was comprised of a consecutive case series of 35 patients with acute unilateral idiopathic CSC, and age- and sex-matched 50 control eyes. AXL of both eyes of unilateral CSC patients and the control eyes were investigated. AXL was measured by ultrasonic biometry, and the adjusted AXL was calculated for CSC eyes as measured AXL plus differences of foveal thickness between CSC and normal fellow eyes in millimeters. The main outcome measures were comparison of AXL between CSC, fellow and control eyes. RESULTS: The mean age of 35 CSC patients was 45.5y, and 31 males were included. The adjusted AXL of CSC eyes was 23.52 mm, and the AXL of fellow eyes was 23.46 mm, and of control eyes 23.94 mm. The AXL of both CSC and fellow eyes were significantly shorter than control eyes (CSC vs control, P=0.044; fellow vs control, P=0.026). There was no statistically significant difference in AXL between CSC and fellow eyes. CONCLUSION: In unilateral idiopathic CSC, the AXL of CSC and fellow eyes are shorter than that of control eyes. Short AXL may be related with choroidal circulation abnormality in CSC. © 2016, International Journal of Ophthalmology (c/o Editorial Office).

Biometrics related researches have been increasingly handled by scientists to achieve more secure and high performed systems. In low level or higher level designs, there are two basic criterion initially to be considered: area and speed.

In this study, there will be system related biometric research and implementations by only considering the high level designs. Module based high level design is Implemented which includes feature extraction and decision modules. In the first, biometric feature extraction together with relatively new techniques is handled. Fingerprint identification and face recognition are the first part interests by using new operators to reduce the operation complexity. In the second module, the decision of the authentication will be handled by using multi biometrics. Fingerprint and face are popular biometrics. In the feature extraction phase, new method to obtain features is used both for the finger and for the face. New image processing operator, Relational Bit Operator (RBO) is for the face biometry. Besides, Angle Invariant Fingerprint Features Matching Technique (AIFM) is for fingerprint matching. This paper presents the introduction to biometric systems together wkh literature review.

Our objective was to describe heart sparing effects in normally grown fetuses, and compare the presentation and outcome of heart sparing between fetuses with growth restriction and those who were normally grown.Methods: In a series of fetuses with prominent antegrade CA flow, we assessed Doppler flow profiles in the aortic isthmus, ductus venosus (DV), umbilical vein (UV), umbilical artery (UA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA). We calculated MCA and UA systolic/diastolic ratios and the cerebral placental ratio, and measured fetal biometry. We evaluated cardiac function using the myocardial performance index (MPI) and the cardiovascular profile score (CVPS).Results: Ten fetuses with heart sparing had normal DV flow at 24-36.6 (mean 30.9) weeks of gestation. Five had growth restriction (Group 1); 4/5 had normal MPI and CVPS, and one died. Five were normally grown (Group 2); 5/5 had elevated MPI and decreased CVPS, of these 2 died in utero and one died immediately after birth despite urgent delivery. Coronary arteries were normal after birth or autopsy.Conclusions: Heart sparing confers a poor prognosis in fetal growth restriction and in normally grown fetuses with cardiac dysfunction.

It is unclear how the numerous odorant molecules and their possible mixtures are discriminated by relatively few olfactory receptors. Using an information theoretic model, we show that a receptor array is optimal for this task if it achieves two possibly conflicting goals: (i) Each receptor should respond to half of all odors and (ii) the response of different receptors should be uncorrelated when averaged over odors presented with natural statistics. We use these design principles to predict statistics of the affinities between receptors and odorant molecules for a broad class of odor statistics. We also show that optimal receptor arrays can be tuned to either resolve concentrations well or distinguish mixtures reliably. Finally, we use our results to predict properties of experimentally measured receptor arrays. Our work can thus be used to better understand natural olfaction, and it also suggests ways to improve artificial sensor arrays.","Information theory; Molecular recognition; Natural statistics; Olfaction; Sensing","Article; entropy; excitation; human; natural odor; odor; olfactory receptor; priority journal; receptor affinity; receptor sensitivity; smelling; biometry; information science; odor; olfactory receptor; physiology; fragrance; olfactory receptor; Biometry; Humans; Information Theory; Odorants; Receptors, Odorant; Smell"

The present review systematically examines the integration of language models to improve classifier performance in brain-computer interface (BCI) communication systems. Approach. The domain of natural language has been studied extensively in linguistics and has been used in the natural language processing field in applications including information extraction, machine translation, and speech recognition. While these methods have been used for years in traditional augmentative and assistive communication devices, information about the output domain has largely been ignored in BCI communication systems. Over the last few years, BCI communication systems have started to leverage this information through the inclusion of language models. Main results. Although this movement began only recently, studies have already shown the potential of language integration in BCI communication and it has become a growing field in BCI research. BCI communication systems using language models in their classifiers have progressed down several parallel paths, including: word completion; signal classification; integration of process models; dynamic stopping; unsupervised learning; error correction; and evaluation. Significance. Each of these methods have shown significant progress, but have largely been addressed separately. Combining these methods could use the full potential of language model, yielding further performance improvements. This integration should be a priority as the field works to create a BCI system that meets the needs of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis population. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","braincomputer interface; language model; natural language processing; P300 speller; predictive spelling","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Error correction; Integration; Interfaces (computer); Natural language processing systems; Speech recognition; Speech transmission; User interfaces; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Augmentative and assistive communication devices; Classifier performance; Language model; NAtural language processing; P300 speller; predictive spelling; Signal classification; Brain computer interface; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Bayesian learning; biometry; brain computer interface; classifier; clinical evaluation; data base; decision making; dynamics; extraction; hidden Markov model; human; information processing; integration; language; linguistics; machine learning; measurement error; Medline; natural language processing; priority journal; probability; process model; Review; signal processing; speech discrimination; systematic review; visual evoked potential"

Most conventional classifiers assume equally balanced classes. They do not work well when impostor samples vastly outnumber the samples of the genuine user class. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, called RABOC, which inherits the natural capabilities of one-class classification and Real AdaBoost algorithm to handle the class imbalance problem in biometric systems. Particularly, we develop a weak classifier, which consists of one-class classifiers and is trained using data from both classes. We then exploit Real AdaBoost to combine the multiple weak classifiers in order to improve their performance without causing overfitting. Unlike the conventional Real AdaBoost, the weak classifiers in the proposed schema are learned on the same data set, but with different parameter choices. This not only generates the diversity necessary to make RABOC work, but also reduces the number of user-specified parameters. Extensive experiments were carried out on the BioSecure DS2 and XM2VTS benchmark databases, which involve data with extremely imbalanced class distribution. They demonstrate that the proposed RABOC algorithm can achieve a relative performance improvement of 28%, 24%, and 22% as compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, specifically the sum of scores, likelihood ratio based score fusion, and Support Vector Machines. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Biometric authentication; Class imbalance problem; Classifier ensemble; One-class classification; Real AdaBoost","Adaptive boosting; Algorithms; Authentication; Biometrics; Biometric authentication; Class imbalance problems; Classifier ensembles; Conventional classifier; Multimodal biometric authentications; One-class Classification; State-of-the-art techniques; Two-class classifier; Classification (of information); Article; BalanceCascade algorithm; Bayesian learning; biometry; classification algorithm; controlled study; decision tree; EasyEnsemble algorithm; k nearest neighbor; learning algorithm; machine learning; measurement accuracy; Minimum Description Length; Monte Carlo method; noise; priority journal; problem solving; RABOC algorithm; random forest; RUSBoost algorithm; SMOTEBoost algorithm; support vector machine; systematic error; UnderBagging algorithm; validation process"

Obtained results showed that a difference in U uptake by three investigated plant species depends not only of the type of substrate types and plant organs but also of their cultivars. Biometrics techniques provide a good opportunity for a better understanding the behavior of plants and obtaining much more useful information from the original data. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","biometrics; Corn; phytoremediation; soy bean; sunflower; uranium","soil pollutant; uranium; biometry; bioremediation; maize; metabolism; principal component analysis; soil pollutant; soybean; sunflower; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biometry; Helianthus; Principal Component Analysis; Soil Pollutants, Radioactive; Soybeans; Uranium; Zea mays"

The delivery of microbicides through vaginal rings is widely perceived as a way to achieve better adherence but vaginal rings do not eliminate the adherence challenges exhibited in clinical trials. Improved objective measures of adherence are needed as new ARV-based vaginal ring products enter the clinical trial stage. Methods: To identify technologies that have potential future application for vaginal ring adherence measurement, a comprehensive literature search was conducted that covered a number of biomedical and public health databases, including PubMed, Embase, POPLINE and the Web of Science. Published patents and patent applications were also searched. Technical experts were also consulted to gather more information and help evaluate identified technologies. Approaches were evaluated as to feasibility of development and clinical trial implementation, cost and technical strength. Results: Numerous approaches were identified through our landscape analysis and classified as either point measures or cumulative measures of vaginal ring adherence. Point measurements are those that give a measure of adherence at a particular point in time. Cumulative measures attempt to measure ring adherence over a period of time. Discussion: Approaches that require modifications to an existing ring product are at a significant disadvantage, as this will likely introduce additional regulatory barriers to the development process and increase manufacturing costs. From the point of view of clinical trial implementation, desirable attributes would be high acceptance by trial participants, and little or no additional time or training requirements on the part of participants or clinic staff. We have identified four promising approaches as being high priority for further development based on the following measurements: intracellular drug levels, drug levels in hair, the accumulation of a vaginal analyte that diffuses into the ring, and the depletion of an intrinsic ring constituent. Conclusions: While some approaches show significant promise over others, it is recommended that a strategy of using complementary biometric and behavioural approaches be adopted to best understand participants' adherence to ARV-based ring products in clinical trials. © 2016 Stalter RM et al; licensee International AIDS Society.","Adherence; Antiretrovirals; Biomarkers; Biometrics; Clinical trials.; HIV; Prevention; Vaginal rings","anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; biological marker; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; antiinfective agent; biological marker; biofilm; biometry; color; drug blood level; drug determination; drug hair level; drug saliva level; electronic sensor; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection prevention; medication compliance; patent; patient compliance; pH; priority journal; radiofrequency identification; Review; systematic review; temperature; vagina discharge; vagina ring; vaginal pressure; clinical trial (topic); female contraceptive device; HIV Infections; Anti-HIV Agents; Anti-Infective Agents; Biomarkers; Clinical Trials as Topic; Contraceptive Devices, Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Medication Adherence"

Methods Data were derived from a multicenter prospective cohort study in which women scheduled for conventional anterior colporrhaphy underwent translabial 3D ultrasound and MRI prior to surgery. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to estimate interobserver reliability between two independent observers and determine the agreement between ultrasound and MRI measurements. Bland-Altman plots were created to assess the agreement between ultrasound and MRI measurements. Results Data from 139 women from nine hospitals were included in the study. The interobserver reliability of ultrasound assessment at rest, during Valsalva maneuver and during contraction and of MRI assessment at rest were moderate or good. The agreement between ultrasound and MRI for the measurement of levator hiatal biometry at rest was moderate, with ICCs of 0.52 (95%CI, 0.32-0.66) for levator hiatal area, 0.44 (95%CI, 0.21-0.60) for anteroposterior diameter and 0.44 (95%CI, 0.22-0.60) for transverse diameter. Levator hiatal biometry measurements were statistically significantly larger on MRI than on translabial 3D ultrasound. Conclusions The agreement between translabial 3D ultrasound and MRI for measurement of the levator hiatus at rest in women with pelvic organ prolapse was only moderate. The results of translabial 3D ultrasound and MRI should therefore not be used interchangeably in daily practice or in clinical research. Copyright © 2015 ISUOG.

Objective: To create a sonographic reference range nomogram of the AFI for a Nigerian population using polynomial regression, and to test for reproducibility of AFI measurements. Methods: Five hundred and sixty patients between 16 and 40 weeks fetal gestational age (FGA) were sampled for the study. The FGA was estimated sonographically by combining the fetal biparietal diameter, abdominal circumference, and femoral length measurements. The AFI was obtained by measuring and summing up the deepest pool of amniotic fluid devoid of fetal parts and umbilical cord in each quadrant of the maternal abdomen. To test for reproducibility of AFI measurements, two sonographers with more than 8 years of obstetric clinical experience independently measured the AFI of 40 patients. Polynomial regression, Pearson's correlation, and intra class correlations were used for data analysis. Results: The mean ± SD of the AFI obtained in the second and third trimester respectively is 15.2 ± 4.0 cm, and 16.0 ± 5.8 cm. There was a steady but insignificant decrease in the AFI at all the FGA studied. A log transformed linear model adequately fitted the relationship between the AFI and FGA, given as: AFIcm=1.1461+0.00091×FGA(R2=0.002). Our normal AFI range is from 8.6 cm to 27.0 cm. Conclusion: Oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios can be satisfactorily diagnosed in the study population when AFI measurement is below or above 8.6 cm and 27.0 cm respectively. © 2015 The College of Radiographers.","Amniotic fluid index; Nigeria; Nomogram; Obstetrics; Sonography","abdominal circumference; adolescent; adult; amnion fluid; amniotic fluid index; analytical parameters; anthropometric parameters; Article; biometry; controlled study; echography; female; femoral length; fetal gestational age; fetus; gestational age; human; major clinical study; Nigerian; priority journal; reproducibility; scoring system; third trimester pregnancy; umbilical cord"

Methods A new vertical cranial biometric measurement was defined: the foramen magnum-to-cranium distance (FCD), measured between the foramen magnum and the upper inner cranial border along the posterior wall of the brainstem. The measurement was performed in a precise mid-sagittal plane using a three-dimensional multiplanar display of a sagittally acquired sonographic volume of the fetal head. The normal reference range was developed by measuring 396 healthy fetuses of low-risk singleton pregnancies between 15 and 40 gestational weeks. This reference was applied to 25 fetuses with microcephaly diagnosed prenatally (Fmic) based on HC ≥ 3 SD below the mean for gestational age. We determined an optimal FCD cut-off for combination with HC to detect all cases found with microcephaly at birth (micB), while excluding the fetuses with normal head circumference at birth (NHCB), who were described postnatally as having an acrocephalic-like cranial deformation. Results In the healthy singleton fetuses, FCD increased with gestational age, with a quadratic equation providing an optimal fit to the data (adjusted R2 = 0.934). The measurement could be assessed in 95.2% of cases. Of the 25 cases diagnosed with Fmic prenatally, on the basis of HC alone, 14 were micB and 11 were NHCB. We observed FCD below the mean - 2SD for gestational age in all 14 micB cases, but in only four of the 11 NHCB cases (P &lt; 0.003). An acrocephalic-like cranial deformation was described at birth in five of the seven NHCB cases with normal FCD. The mean ± SD FCD Z-score of the micB cases was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.001) than that of the false-positive ones: -3.85 ± 0.96 SD and -1.59 ± 1.45 SD, respectively. Based on HC measurement alone, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 56%. Combination of the HC and FCD criteria raised the PPV to 78%, decreasing the number of false positives from 11 to four, without missing any of the 14 micB cases. Conclusions Fetal vertical cranial biometric assessment in the mid-sagittal plane is feasible and correlates well with gestational age. In our series, a vertical cranial deformation was a frequent cause of a false Fmic diagnosis made on the basis of HC alone. Combination of the new vertical cranial biometric measurement with HC measurement can exclude these cases and thus improve diagnostic accuracy for Fmic. Copyright © 2016 ISUOG.

Methods: A total of 58 fetuses with CHD and 58 controls underwent a Doppler ultrasound and fetal MRI at 36-38 weeks. Fetuses with CHD were divided into two functional classes: class A with an expected severe reduction in oxygenated brain blood supply (left outflow tract obstruction and transposition of great vessels) and class B with theoretically near-normal or mildly impaired oxygenated brain blood supply (other CHD). Head biometry and cerebroplacental Doppler were assessed by ultrasound, and brain volumetry, cortical development and metabolism by MRI. Results: Both class A and B CHD fetuses had significant differences in head biometry, brain perfusion, cortical development and brain metabolism compared with controls. However, there was a significant linear tendency for head biometry, cerebral Doppler, volumes, cortical sulcation and metabolic ratios across the three clinical groups, with signs of more severe brain alterations in type A CHD fetuses. Conclusions: All fetuses with CHD showed significant brain developmental changes, but differences were more pronounced in CHD associated with an expected severe reduction in oxygenated blood supply to the brain. © 2015 S.

To evaluate the relationship between lens position parameters and intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction after cataract surgery in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and in nonglaucomatous patients. METHODS. The main outcomes of this prospective study were percent and absolute IOP change, which were calculated using the preoperative IOP and the IOP 4 months after cataract surgery in POAG and nonglaucomatous eyes. Lens position (LP), defined as anterior chamber depth (ACD) + one-half lens thickness (LT), was assessed preoperatively using parameters from optical biometry. Preoperative IOP, axial length (AL), ACD, LT, relative lens position (RLP), and the ratio of preoperative IOP to ACD (PD ratio) were also evaluated as potential predictors of IOP change. RESULTS. Four months postoperatively, the average IOP reduction was 2.80 ± 3.83 mm Hg (15.79%) from the preoperative mean of 14.73 ± 2.89 mm Hg for nonglaucomatous eyes. The average IOP reduction was 2.66 ± 2.07 mm Hg (16.98%) from the preoperative mean of 14.86 ± 2.97 mm Hg for POAG eyes. Preoperative IOP, sex, AL, ACD, PD ratio, and LP predicted IOP change in nonglaucomatous eyes. Preoperative IOP and PD ratio predicted IOP change in POAG eyes. CONCLUSIONS. Intraocular pressure reduction after phacoemulsification cataract surgery in nonglaucomatous eyes is significantly greater in more anteriorly positioned lenses. Though it did not reach statistical significance in patients with glaucoma, the association of LP with IOP reduction is in the same direction as in nonglaucomatous patients where smaller LP appears to predict greater IOP reduction. Lens position is a simple, easily calculable, accurate, and widely available parameter, which clinicians can potentially utilize in managing glaucoma. © 2016 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

Methods In 402 consecutive patients planned for RLE at Koskelas Eye Clinic, Luleä, Sweden, right eye data from pre- and postoperative subjective refraction, preoperative IOLMaster® biometry and Pentacam HR® measurements were collected. Postoperative Pentacam HR® data were collected for 54 of the patients. The spherical and astigmatic powers of the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces and for the total cornea were assessed and compared, and surgically, induced astigmatism was calculated using vector analysis. Results The spherical power of the anterior corneal surface was 48.18 ± 1.69D with an astigmatic power of 0.83 ± 0.54D. The corresponding values for the posterior surface were -6.05 ± 2,52D and 0.26 ± 0.15D, respectively. The total corneal spherical power calculated with ray tracing was 42.47 ± 2.89D with a 0.72 ± 0.48D astigmatic power, and the corresponding figures obtained by estimating the posterior corneal surface were 43.25 ± 1.51D (p &lt; 0.001) with a 0.75 ± 0.49D astigmatic power (p = 0.003). In eyes with anterior astigmatism with-the-rule, the total corneal astigmatism is overestimated if the posterior corneal surface is estimated; in eyes, with against-the-rule astigmatism it is underestimated. Had the posterior corneal surface been measured in this material, 14.7% of the patients would have received a spheric instead of a toric IOL, or vice versa. Conclusion Estimating the posterior corneal surface in RLE patients leads to systematic measurement errors that can be reduced by measuring the posterior surface. Such an approach can potentially increase the refractive outcome accuracy in RLE surgery. © 2016 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

SB surgery was performed using an encircling element and segmental buckle. Axial length (AL); anterior chamber depth (ACD), defined as the distance from the corneal epithelium to the anterior lens surface; anterior/posterior corneal curvature (K); and refraction were measured preoperatively and at week 1 and months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 postoperatively. Stability of each parameter was defined as the earliest time point at which there is no significant difference compared to its value at month 12.RESULTS: AL increased (26.09 ± 1.46 to 26.51 ± 1.96, P = .01), ACD decreased (3.84 ± 0.47 to 3.32 ± 0.57, P < .001), and a myopic shift of 1.04 diopters (95% CI 0.03-2.05, P = .04) occurred at month 12. Anterior/posterior K were not significantly changed from baseline. AL stabilized at month 3 while ACD and spherical equivalent (SE) stabilized at week 1. Cryotherapy was associated with greater increase in AL (P = .001) and myopic shift (P = .02). More extensive segmental buckling was associated with greater increase in AL (P = .009) and myopic shift (P = .03).CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that patients requiring cataract surgery after SB should have biometry performed no earlier than 3 months post SB surgery, and intraocular lens power calculation with a fourth-generation formula. A greater increase in AL and myopic shift was associated with cryotherapy and more extensive segmental buckling. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

IUGR is diagnosed when ultrasound-estimated fetal weight is below the 10th percentile for gestational age. IUGR diagnosis implies a pathologic process behind low fetal weight. IUGR in pregnancy complicated by type 1 diabetes is usually caused by placental dysfunction related to maternal vasculopathy. Prevention of IUGR should ideally start before pregnancy. Strict glycemic control and intensive treatment of nephropathy and hypertension are essential. Low-dose aspirin initiated before 16 gestational weeks can also reduce IUGR risk in women with vasculopathy. Umbilical and uterine artery Doppler studies can guide diagnosis and surveillance of fetuses with IUGR. Decisions regarding the timing of delivery should be based on assessment of umbilical artery Doppler. The risk of prematurity and impaired fetal lung maturation should always be considered, especially in fetuses younger than 32 weeks. © 2016, The Author(s).","Intrauterine growth restriction; IUGR; SGA; Small for gestational age; Type 1 diabetes; Vasculopathy","corticosteroid; angiogenesis; biochemical analysis; biometry; corticosteroid therapy; delivery; diet therapy; disease association; Doppler flowmetry; early diagnosis; fetal biophysical profile; fetus electrocardiography; fetus movement; gestational age; histopathology; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; intrauterine growth retardation; maternal care; measurement accuracy; pathogenesis; patient care; physical activity; pregnancy outcome; prenatal care; Review; risk assessment; vascular disease; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes, Gestational; female; Fetal Growth Retardation; fetus echography; pregnancy; umbilical artery; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Gestational Age; Humans; Pregnancy; Ultrasonography, Prenatal; Umbilical Arteries"

The major challenge of this task is that facial appearance is subject to significant change during the aging process. In this paper, we propose to solve the problem with a hierarchical model based on two-level learning. At the first level, effective features are learned from low-level microstructures, based on our new feature descriptor called local pattern selection (LPS). The proposed LPS descriptor greedily selects low-level discriminant patterns in a way, such that intra-user dissimilarity is minimized. At the second level, higher level visual information is further refined based on the output from the first level. To evaluate the performance of our new method, we conduct extensive experiments on the MORPH data set (the largest face aging data set available in the public domain), which show a significant improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods. © 2015 IEEE.","aging faces; Face recognition; feature descriptor","Hierarchical systems; Different ages; Facial appearance; Feature descriptors; Hierarchical learning; Hierarchical model; Missing children; State-of-the-art methods; Visual information; Face recognition; aging; algorithm; biometry; diagnostic imaging; face; factual database; human; image processing; machine learning; physiology; procedures; Aging; Algorithms; Biometric Identification; Databases, Factual; Face; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning"

Eighty lateral and frontal digital cephalometric radiographs from a private Dental Radiology service's database were evaluated. Evaluations were performed in a dimmed lighting room, using a 4.200 lux lightbox with mask, ultrafan paper and pencil with a 0.5 diameter tip. The sheet of paper was superimposed on the radiograph to obtain the outlines of the frontal sinus and two examiners made the drawings independently at two different times, with a minimum period interval between evaluations. To obtain the linear physical measurements of the frontal sinus, a digital pachymeter was used. Later, all the discrete variables were codded for the statistical analysis. All variables were tested by means of the Cohen's Kappa test. The intraexaminer agreement ranged from good to perfect (p < 0.001), while the interexaminer agreement ranged from regular to perfect (p < 0.001).

Methods: In this study, 93 children ranging from ages 2 to 13 who had myopia ≥ −3 diopters in at least one eye were examined with A-scans. The following data was collected and analyzed: history of birth, refractive error (RE), cornea thickness (CT) and average corneal curvature (AVK), depth of anterior chamber (ACD), lens thickness (LT), and axial length (AL) of the eye. Results: Eyes were tested and categorized into four groups: myopic eyes in full-term children (group 1), myopic eyes in premature children (group 2), non-myopic eyes in full-term children (group 3), and non-myopic eyes in preterm children (group 4). The RE were similar between group 1 and group2, and between group 3 and group 4. Myopic eyes in group 2 had higher AVK as compared to group 3; 45.4 Â± 0.4 D vs. 43.5 Â± 0.7 D, p = 0.008. The ACD in group 2 was shallower than that in group 1 (2.5 Â± 0.5 vs. 3.2 Â± 0.3, p = 0.01). The LT measurements in group 2 were thicker than those in group 1 (mean LT = 4.9 Â± 1.0 vs 4.1 Â± 0.3Â mm, p = 0.001, respectively). Finally, AL of myopic eyes in group 1 was longer than that of group 2, p = 0.01. Conclusion: These results suggest that increased axial length plays an important role in myopia in full-term children, whereas corneal curvature and lens thickness are major contributors to myopia in preterm children.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Anogenital distance is associated with serum reproductive hormones, but not with semen quality. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Epidemiological studies have suggested that anogenital distance (AGD) may be associated with testicular dysfunction in adult men. However, the role of AGD in estimating male reproductive function remains unclear. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We examined the associations between AGD and semen parameters and reproductive hormones levels in 656 young college students in a Male Reproductive Health in Chongqing College Students (MARHCSs) cohort study in June of 2014. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In this study, two variants of AGD (AGDAP and AGDAS) were measured in 656 university students. Serum levels of testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), prolactin (PRL), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and inhibin-B; and semen quality outcomes, including semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm number, sperm progressive motility, total motility and morphology, were assessed. The associations between AGD and semen parameters/reproductive hormones levels were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Both AGDAS and AGDAP were not associated with any semen parameters. In the non-parametric correlation analysis, AGDAP were correlated with sperm progressive motility and reproductive hormones of E2, testosterone, SHBG and the testosterone/LH ratio. However, body mass index (BMI) also significantly correlated with serum testosterone (r = -0.216, P = &lt;0.0001) and SHBG (r = -0.229, P = &lt;0.001). In the multiple regression models, AGDAP was negatively associated with the serum E2 level (95% CI, -0.198 to -0.043; P = 0.002) and positively associated with the ratio of T/E2 (95% CI, 0.004-0.011; P = 0.001) after an adjustment for BMI and other confounders. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Using only a single semen sample to predict male reproductive function over a longer period is a potential limitation of the present study. The other limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the study design. Longitudinal data from an extended follow-up on a large cohort would be more definitive. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results do not support previous studies where AGD is associated with male semen quality. The utility of AGD in predicting reproductive outcomes in adult males should thus be considered prudently.

Methods: This prospective study included 180 pregnant women followed up in the outpatient clinic at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Gaziantep University, Turkey, between January 2014 and January 2015. The gestational age (GA) was estimated by early fetal ultrasound measures and last menstrual period. Routine fetal biometric parameters, fetal kidney length, and amniotic fluid index were measured. We studied the correlation between fetal kidney length, amniotic fluid index, and gestational age. Result: The mean gestational age depending on last menstrual period and early ultrasound was 31.98±4.29 (24-39 weeks). The mean kidney length was 35.66±6.61 (19-49 mm). There was a significant correlation between gestational age and fetal kidney length (r=0.947, p=0.001). However, there was a moderate negative correlation between GA and AFI.

The aim of the study was to construct reference ranges for foetal biometric parameters in Greek foetuses and to compare them with previously published models. Materials and Methods: Measurements from 1200 Greek foetuses were used to construct normal curves for biparietal diameter (BPD), occipitofrontal diameter (OFD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), femoral length (FL) and the BPD/FL ratio according to the methodology described by Royston and Wright (1998). The model was validated in a second group of 1200 different foetuses using analysis of the corresponding standardized residuals (z-scores). The z-scores which were derived by our model were compared to those calculated using previously published models from other populations. Results: BPD, OFD, HC, AC, FL and the BPD/FL ratio are accurately described by simple quadratic equations (R2 &gt; 0·96 for most of the parameters tested). Statistically significant differences were observed for most of the z-scores when our models were compared to previously published models. Less than 10% of our foetuses were &lt; 5th or &gt; 95th centile of the latter models. About 10% of our foetuses were &gt; 95th centile for FL and HC when the INTERGROWTH-21st formulas were used. Conclusion: We present national foetal biometric references. Using charts from other populations (including INTERGROWTH-21st) may be unrepresentative of local populations and lead to misclassification of foetal growth status. © 2016 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.

Lu et al. recently proposed a robust biometric based authentication with key agreement protocol for a multi-server environment using smart cards. They claimed that their protocol is efficient and resistant to prominent security attacks. The careful investigation of this paper proves that Lu et al.'s protocol does not provide user anonymity, perfect forward secrecy and is susceptible to server and user impersonation attacks, man-in-middle attacks and clock synchronization problems. In addition, this paper proposes an enhanced biometric based authentication with key-agreement protocol for multi-server architecture based on elliptic curve cryptography using smartcards. We proved that the proposed protocol achieves mutual authentication using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic. The formal security of the proposed protocol is verified using the AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool to show that our protocol can withstand active and passive attacks.

A dramatic increase in the number of cases has been reported over the last decade; however, information on the epidemiological trends of this disease is lacking. The objective of this study is to provide an epidemiological description of human leptospirosis cases over a 9-year period (2004-2012) and disease relationship with meteorological, geographical, and demographical information.A retrospective study was undertaken to describe the patterns of human leptospirosis cases and their association with intrinsic (sex, age, and ethnicity) and extrinsic (location, rainfall, and temperature) factors. Data was grouped according to age, sex, ethnicity, seasonality and geographical distribution, and analyzed using statistical tools to understand the influence of all the different factors on disease incidence.A total of 12,325 cases of leptospirosis were reported between 2004 and 2012 with an upward trend in disease incidence, with the highest in 2012. Three hundred thirty-eight deaths were reported with an overall case fatality rate of 2.74%, with higher incidence in males (9696; 78.7%) compared with female patients (2629; 21.3%), and overall male to female ratio of 3.69:1. Patients aged cohorts between 30-39 years old (16.22 per 100,000 population) had the highest disease incidence while the lowest incidence occurred between <1 to 9 years old (3.44 per 100,000 population). The average incidence was highest amongst Malays (10.97 per 100,000 population), followed by Indians (7.95 per 100,000 population). Stratification according to geographical distribution showed that the state of Malacca had the highest average disease incidence (11.12 per 100,000 population) followed by Pahang (10.08 per 100,000 population). The states of Terengganu, Kelantan, and Perak recorded similar rates of incidence (≈8.00 per 100,000 population), while Johor with the least number of reported cases (1.80 per 100,000 population). Positive relationships were recorded between the number of reported cases with the number of raining days per month and monthly average temperature (p-value < 0.05). However, no significant association was noted between rainfall volume and number of reported Leptospirosis cases.This collaborative efforts between medical, academic and governmental institutions has enabled the construction of this comprehensive database that is essential to understand the disease trends in Malaysia and add insights into the prevention and control of this disease. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Leptospira; Leptospirosis; Outbreaks; Zoonotic infectious disease","rain; disease control; disease incidence; environmental factor; epidemiology; ethnicity; geographical distribution; infectious disease; leptospirosis; seasonality; tropical region; adult; age distribution; Article; child; controlled study; disease association; environmental temperature; ethnicity; female; geographic distribution; human; incidence; leptospirosis; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; mortality; retrospective study; school child; seasonal variation; sex difference; sex ratio; adolescent; age; aged; animal; biometry; comparative study; demography; forecasting; geography; infant; leptospirosis; middle aged; morbidity; mortality; preschool child; season; trends; tropic climate; very elderly; young adult; Zoonoses; Malaysia; Leptospira; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Biometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Demography; Female; Forecasting; Geography; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Leptospirosis; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Morbidity; Retrospective Studies; Seasons; Sex Factors; Tropical Climate; Young Adult; Zoonoses"

In geometric morphometrics, this approach implies applying generalized Procrustes analysis coupled with principal component analysis on multiple individuals or multiple species datasets. The trouble with such a procedure is that it mixes intra- and inter-group variation. While MANCOVA models are relevant statistical/mathematical tools to draw inferences about the similarities of trajectories, if one wants to observe and interpret the morphological deformation alone by filtering inter-group variability, a particular tool, namely parallel transport, is necessary. In the context of ontogenetic trajectories, one should firstly perform separate multivariate regressions between shape and size, using regression predictions to estimate within-group deformations relative to the smallest individuals. These deformations are then applied to a common reference (the mean of per-group smallest individuals). The estimation of deformations can be performed on the Riemannian manifold by using sophisticated connection metrics. Nevertheless, parallel transport can be effectively achieved by estimating deformations in the Euclidean space via ordinary Procrustes analysis. This approach proved very useful in comparing ontogenetic trajectories of species presenting large morphological differences at early developmental stages. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"anatomy and histology; animal; biological model; biometry; classification; mammal; multivariate analysis; principal component analysis; skull; Animals; Biometry; Mammals; Models, Biological; Multivariate Analysis; Principal Component Analysis; Skull"

Although a variety of powerful algorithms have been presented in the past few years, most of them usually focus on designing hand-crafted features and learning metrics either individually or sequentially. Different from previous works, we formulate a unified deep ranking framework that jointly tackles both of these key components to maximize their strengths. We start from the principle that the correct match of the probe image should be positioned in the top rank within the whole gallery set. An effective learning-to-rank algorithm is proposed to minimize the cost corresponding to the ranking disorders of the gallery. The ranking model is solved with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that builds the relation between input image pairs and their similarity scores through joint representation learning directly from raw image pixels. The proposed framework allows us to get rid of feature engineering and does not rely on any assumption. An extensive comparative evaluation is given, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art approaches, including both traditional and CNN-based methods on the challenging VIPeR, CUHK-01, and CAVIAR4REID datasets.

Methods: This study included 48 eyes of 48 cataract patients who underwent cataract surgery with toric IOL implantation. The rotational errors of 3 marking methods—the iris pattern marking method (iris pattern group), the pendulum marking method (pendulum group), and the 3-point marking method (3-point group)—were assessed. Results: The respective rotational errors were 4.0° ± 3.1° (mean ± SD), 5.3° ± 4.1°, and 7.3° ± 6.0°.

Setting Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom. Design Prospective comparative case series. Methods Each participant had biometry with both biometers. The level of agreement between the biometers was calculated using the Bland-Altman method. Double-angle polar plots were used to display the astigmatism vectors. Internal consistency was computed with the Cronbach α coefficient of reliability, whereas the dispersion of probability distribution was assessed with the coefficient of variation (CoV). The intraoperator repeatability was analyzed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); the AL was evaluated in all eyes and the mean K and the ACD in a subset of eyes. Results The study comprised 215 eyes; the ICC for the mean K and ACD was calculated in a subset of 54 eyes. There was a statistically significant difference between the 2 biometers in all measurements (P < .05). The level of agreement was high with both methods. The ICC and internal consistency were excellent with both biometers; the CoVs were low. Conclusions The OLCI biometer provided good agreement and repeatability compared with the PCI biometer, the current gold standard in ocular biometry.

Methods Microcephaly in utero was defined as a fetal HC 3SD below the mean for gestational age according to Jeanty et al.'s reference range. The records of cases with fetal microcephaly (Fmic) were evaluated for medical history, imaging findings, biometry and postnatal examination/autopsy findings. Microcephaly was confirmed at birth (micB) by an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) or a brain weight at autopsy 2SD below the mean for gestational age. The new INTERGROWTH-21st Project and a recent Israeli reference for fetal growth were applied for evaluation of the Fmic positive predictive value (PPV) for diagnosis of micB cases. Optimal HC cut-offs were determined for each of the new references with the aim of detecting all micB cases whilst minimizing the number of false positives found to have a normal HC at birth. We also assessed the difference between the Z-scores of the prenatal HC and the corresponding OFC at birth, the frequency of small-for-gestational age (SGA), decreased HC/abdominal circumference (AC) and HC/femur length (FL) ratios, the prevalence of associated malformations and family history. Results Forty-two fetuses were diagnosed as having Fmic according to the Jeanty reference, but micB was confirmed in only 24 (PPV, 57.1%). The optimal INTERGROWTH and Israeli reference HC cut-offs for micB diagnosis were mean - 3SD and mean - 2.3SD, resulting in a statistically non-significant improvement in PPV to 61.5% and 66.7%, respectively. The presence of a family history of microcephaly, SGA, associated malformations and application of stricter HC cut-offs resulted in a higher PPV of micB, although not statistically significant and with a concurrent increase in the number of false-negative results. The deviation of the HC from the mean, by all references, was significantly larger compared with the actual deviation of the OFC at birth, with mean differences between the corresponding Z-scores of -1.15, -1.95 and -0.74 for the Jeanty, INTERGROWTH and Israeli references, respectively. Conclusions The evaluated reference ranges all result in considerable over-diagnosis of fetal microcephaly. The use of the two new HC reference ranges did not significantly improve micB prediction compared with that of Jeanty et al., whilst use of additional characteristics and stricter HC cut-offs could improve the PPV with an increase in false negatives. The postnatal OFC deviates significantly less from the mean compared with the prenatal HC, and we propose that adjustment for this would enable better prediction of the actual OFC deviation at birth.

Complications, however, may affect the patient's quality of life and level of satisfaction. Common problems with multifocal lenses are blurred vision and photic phenomena associated with residual ametropia, posterior capsule opacification, large pupil size, wavefront anomalies, dry eye, and lens decentration. The main reasons for these are failure to neuroadapt, lens dislocation, residual refractive error, and lens opacification. To avoid patient dissatisfaction after multifocal intraocular lens implantation, it is important to consider preoperatively the patient's lifestyle; perform an exhaustive examination including biometry, topography, and pupil reactivity; and explain the visual expectations and possible postoperative complications. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Complications; Indications; Multifocal IOLs; Patient dissatisfaction; Visual outcomes",

Physiological characteristics of the body, such as the heart rate or Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, are promising means to simplify the setup process and to improve security of BANs. This paper describes the design and implementation steps required to realize an ECG-based authentication protocol to identify sensor nodes attached to the same human body. Therefore, the first part of the paper addresses the design of a body-area sensor system, including the hardware setup, analogue and digital signal processing, and required ECG feature detection techniques. A model-based design flow is applied, and strengths and limitations of each design step are discussed. Real-world measured data originating from the implemented sensor system are then used to set up and parametrize a novel physiological authentication protocol for BANs. The authentication protocol utilizes statistical properties of expected and detected deviations to limit the number of false positive and false negative authentication attempts. The result of the described holistic design effort is the first practical implementation of biometric authentication in BANs that reflects timing and data uncertainties in the physical and cyber parts of the system. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Authentication; Biometric; Body area sensor networks; Design","Authentication; Biometrics; Design; Electrocardiography; Physiology; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Authentication protocols; Biometric authentication; Body area sensor networks; Design and implementations; Electrocardiogram signal; False positive and false negatives; Physiological characteristics; Statistical properties; Body sensor networks; art; biometry; electrocardiography; genetic procedures; heart rate; human; physiologic monitoring; physiology; procedures; wireless communication; Biometric Identification; Biosensing Techniques; Electrocardiography; Heart Rate; Human Body; Humans; Monitoring, Physiologic; Wireless Technology"

For these diagnostics to achieve maximum impact on patient care, scientists and engineers developing the tests should understand the analytical and clinical statistical metrics that determine the efficacy of the test. Appreciating and using these metrics will benefit test developers by providing consistent measures to evaluate analytical and clinical test performance, as well as guide the design of tests that will most benefit clinicians and patients. This paper is broken into four sections that discuss metrics related to general stages of development including: (1) laboratory assay development (analytical sensitivity, limit of detection, analytical selectivity, and trueness/precision), (2) pre-clinical development (diagnostic sensitivity, diagnostic specificity, clinical cutoffs, and receiver-operator curves), (3) clinical use (prevalence, predictive values, and likelihood ratios), and (4) case studies from existing clinical data for tests relevant to the lab-on-a-chip community (HIV, group A strep, and chlamydia). Each section contains definitions of recommended statistical measures, as well as examples demonstrating the importance of these metrics at various stages of the development process.

This seemingly stochastic heterogeneity provides researchers great challenges in elucidating factors that determine metastatic outgrowth. Herein, we develop and implement an integrative platform that will enable researchers to obtain novel insights from intricate metastatic landscapes.

The second segment of our platform applies our custom-developed SMART 3D (Spatial filtering-based background removal and Multi-chAnnel forest classifiers-based 3D ReconsTruction), a multi-faceted image analysis pipeline, permitting quantitative interrogation of functional implications of heterogeneous metastatic landscape constituents, from subcellular features to multicellular structures, within our large three-dimensional (3D) image datasets. Coupling whole tissue imaging of brain metastasis animal models with SMART 3D, we demonstrate the capability of our integrative pipeline to reveal and quantify volumetric and spatial aspects of brain metastasis landscapes, including diverse tumor morphology, heterogeneous proliferative indices, metastasis-associated astrogliosis, and vasculature spatial distribution. Collectively, our study demonstrates the utility of our novel integrative platform to reveal and quantify the global spatial and volumetric characteristics of the 3D metastatic landscape with unparalleled accuracy, opening new opportunities for unbiased investigation of novel biological phenomena in situ.",,"animal; biometry; brain tumor; diagnostic imaging; fluorescence imaging; metastasis; mouse; pathology; procedures; secondary; Animals; Biometry; Brain Neoplasms; Mice; Neoplasm Metastasis; Optical Imaging; Pathology"

Evidence indicates that communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus can be two sequential phases of a single pathological phenomenon triggered by ependymal disruption and/or abnormal function of the subcommissural organ. We have hypothesized that a similar phenomenon may occur in human cases with fetal onset hydrocephalus. Case presentation: We report here on a case of human fetal communicating hydrocephalus with no central nervous system abnormalities other than stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius (SA) that became non-communicating hydrocephalus during the first postnatal week due to obliteration of the cerebral aqueduct. The case was followed closely by a team of basic and clinic investigators allowing an early diagnosis and prediction of the evolving pathophysiology. This information prompted neurosurgeons to perform a third ventriculostomy at postnatal day 14. The fetus was monitored by ultrasound, computerized axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After birth, the follow up was by MRI, electroencephalography and neurological and neurocognitive assessments. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected at surgery showed abnormalities in the subcommissural organ proteins and the membrane proteins L1-neural cell adhesion molecule and aquaporin-4. The neurological and neurocognitive assessments at 3 and 6years of age showed neurological impairments (epilepsy and cognitive deficits). Conclusions: (1) In a hydrocephalic fetus, a stenosed SA can become obliterated at perinatal stages. (2) In the case reported, a close follow up of a communicating hydrocephalus detected in utero allowed a prompt postnatal surgery aiming to avoid as much brain damage as possible. (3) The clinical and pathological evolution of this patient supports the possibility that the progressive stenosis of the SA initiated during the embryonic period may have resulted from ependymal disruption of the cerebral aqueduct and dysfunction of the subcommissural organ. The analysis of subcommissural organ glycoproteins present in the CSF may be a valuable diagnostic tool for the pathogenesis of congenital hydrocephalus. © 2016 Ortega et al.","Aqueduct of Sylvius; Case study; Cerebral aqueduct; Cerebrospinal fluid; Congenital hydrocephalus; Stenosis; Subcommissural organ","aquaporin 4; ceftriaxone; membrane protein L1 neural cell adhesion molecule; nerve cell adhesion molecule; phenobarbital; unclassified drug; vancomycin; glycoprotein; anastomosis; Article; biometry; brain aqueduct; brain size; case report; cerebrospinal fluid; cognition; cognitive defect; computer assisted tomography; drug dose reduction; early diagnosis; electroencephalography; epilepsy; female; fetus; follow up; human; hydrocephalus; intensive care; molecular biology; monotherapy; neurologic examination; neurosurgeon; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obliteration of the aquedyct of Sylvius; occlusive cerebrovascular disease; onset age; perinatal period; postoperative period; prediction; prefrontal cortex; psychomotor development; subcommissural organ; tonic clonic seizure; treatment response; ventriculomegaly; brain aqueduct; hydrocephalus; metabolism; pathology; pregnancy; stenosis, occlusion and obstruction; Cerebral Aqueduct; Constriction, Pathologic; Female; Fetus; Glycoproteins; Humans; Hydrocephalus; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pregnancy; Subcommissural Organ"

However, the measurement of the dimension of anterior segment from the OCT image with high speed and precision is a challenge at present. The software of automatic data processing is still lack in analyzing spectral domain OCT. Objective: This study was to perform the automatic biometry and data processing of human ocular anterior segment OCT image by using self-developed automatic detection software and evaluate the accuracy and repeatability of this method. Methods: Twenty eyes of 10 normal subjects were included in Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from June to July 2013. The OCT image of anterior eye segments were obtained with custom-made ultra-long scan depth OCT under the informed consent. An automatic software algorithm was developed for the biometric measurement on these OCT images, including boundary segmentation, image registration and optical correction of OCT images. The boundary segmentation algorithm utilized the axial gradient information of OCT images and the shortest path search principal based on the dynamic programming to optimize edge finding. Central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), pupil diameter (PD), lens thickness (LT), radius of lens anterior curvatures (LAC) and radius of lens of posterior curvatures (LPC) were automatically and manually measured, and the validity of automatic detection algorithm was assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the automatic and manual measurements, and the repeatability was validated by calculating the coefficient of repeatability (COR) between repeated measurement. This study was approved by the Ethic Committee of Wenzhou Medical University and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Results: There were no significant differences in the results of CCT, ACD, PD, LT, LAC and LPC between the automatic and manual measurements (P=0.205, 0.167, 0.285, 0.127, 0.102, 0.074). The results were consistent between automatic and manual measurements (all at ICC>0.75). The repeated measurement values were consistent in CCT, ACD and LT in both automatic and manual modes (all at ICC>0.75). The reproducibilities of automatic biometry in PD and LAC (ICC=0.793, 0.872; COR=2.90, 5.79) were better than those of manual mode (ICC=0.631, 0.579; COR=5.62, 10.46); while the reproducibility of automatic biometry in LPC (ICC=0.663; COR=6.17) was lower than that of manual mode (ICC=0.794, COR=4.79). Conclusions: Self-developed automatic detection software appears to be accurate and repeatable in measuring dimension of spectral domain OCT images.

Objective: This study was to access the repeatability of corneal power measurements in post-laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) eyes with Galilei II dual Scheimpflug analyzer. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 68 eyes of 36 subjects who received LASIK surgery more than 3 months in Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University were recruited from July to September in 2011. The mean preoperative spherical equivalent diopter was (-4.95±2.08) D in the subjects with the diopter range from -1.75 D to -10.00 D. The parameters of corneal power were measured by Galilei II dual Scheimpflug analyzer, including SimK, Ka, K, KG and Kray. Three-time consecutive measurements were completed in every examined eye to obtain the data of SimK, Ka, Kp, KG and Kray, respectively. The coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation (SD), Cronbach a coefficient and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated to evaluate the repeatability. Concordance between the different measurements was assessed using Bland-Altman agreement analysis. This study followed the Helsinki Declaration, all subjects signed informed consent. Results: The CVs of three-time measured SimK, Ka, Kp, KG and Kray were 0.24%, 0.28%, -0.37%, 0.31% and 0.32%, respectively, and the Cronbach a values were &gt;0.9 and the ICCs were &gt;0.982. The Bland-Altman analysis between different measurements showed that the maximum 95% limits of agreement (LoA) were 0.37 D for SimK, 0.46 D for Ka, 0.09 D for Kp, 0.45 D for KG and 0.49 D for Kray Respectively. Conclusions: The Galilei II dual Scheimpflug analyzer performed high repeatability and concordance on corneal power measurements in post-LASIK eyes. The differences between measuring results are clinically acceptable.

Corvis ST is applied abroad, but the study on its accuracy is few in China. Objective: This diagnostic trial was to evaluate the accuracy of Corvis ST for CCT and IOP measurement in myopic population. Methods: Fifty-six eyes from 56 myopic patients were prospective recruited in Visual Science and Optometry Center of Guangxi from November to December in 2012. IOP was measured by using Corvis ST and Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT), and CCT was measured by Corvis ST and A type ultrasonic pachymetry. The CCT difference between Corvis ST and A type ultrasonic pachymetry as well as IOP between Corvis ST and GAT were compared by using paired-t test, and agreements of measured outcomes were analyzed by Bland-Altman method. This study was approved by the Ethic Committee of People's Hospital of Guangxi and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Results: The CCT from Corvis ST was (539.82±19.79) μm, which was significantly higher than (535.34±19.41) μm from A type ultrasonic pachymetry (t=4.19, P<0.001). Bland-Altman analysis revealed that the CCT measured by Corvis ST was 4.5 μm higher than that of A type ultrasonic pachymetry, with the 95% limit of agreement ranged from -11.2 to 20.2 μm, and 7.1% (4/56) of points were located at the outside of the 95% confidence interval. The IOP measured by Corvis ST and GAT were (15.75±1.60) mmHg and (16.23±2.40) mmHg, respectively, showing statistically significant difference between the two methods (t=2.15, P=0.04). Bland-Altman analysis revealed that the IOP measurement of Corvis ST was 0.5 mmHg lower than that of GAT, with the 95% limit of agreement ranged from -3.8 to 2.8 mmHg, and 3.57% (2/56) of points were located at the outside of the 95% confidence interval. Conclusions: CCT obtained by Corvis ST is higher than that by A type ultrasonic pachymetry with poor agreement between these two outcomes, and the two methods cannot replace each other clinically in myopic eyes. IOP value from Corvis ST is slightly lower than that from GAT, showing a good agreement between these two outcomes. The IOP value of Corvis ST shows satisfactory accuracy.

Methods: The study groups were comprised of four age- and gender-matched cohorts: American Caucasians, American Chinese, southern and northern mainland Chinese. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) was performed to assess the following measurements of the ciliary body: trabecular-ciliary process distance (TCPD), trabecular-ciliary process angle (TCA) and ciliary body thickness at 1 mm posterior to the scleral spur (CBT1). A-scan ultrasonography was used to measure lens thickness (LT) and relative lens position (RLP), defined as (ACD + LT/2)/AL. Results: There were 109, 111, 115 and 117 subjects enrolled in the American Caucasian, American Chinese, and southern and northern mainland Chinese groups, respectively. Collectively, the Chinese had smaller TCPD (0.834 ± 0.234 versus 0.940 ± 0.236 mm, p < 0.001) and TCA (75.1 ± 17.9 versus 85.0 ± 21.5, p < 0.001) than Caucasians. No difference was found between the three Chinese subgroups, therefore they were combined as one for the following analyses. After multiple linear regression analysis, adjusting for age, gender, spherical equivalent (SE) and axial length (AL), TCPD and TCA were positively associated with CBT1 and RLP, but negatively correlated with LT in the whole sample. The ethnic Chinese had significantly smaller CBT1 (SRC = −0.177, p < 0.001) and RLP (SRC = −0.254, p < 0.001) than that of Caucasians. Conclusions: Compared with the Caucasians, the Chinese had a thinner ciliary body and a more anteriorly positioned lens, which may contribute to more anteriorly positioned ciliary processes in this population. These findings might help to explain the higher prevalence of angle closure in the Chinese. © 2016 Taylor & Francis, LLC.","Biometry; ciliary body; ethnic difference; ultrasound biomicroscopy",

Setting Northeast Veterans Administration Hospital, Northport, New York, USA. Design Retrospective case study. Methods Phacoemulsification surgeries performed by residents before and after a biometry curriculum were reviewed. The inclusion criterion was phacoemulsification performed by residents. Patients with fewer than 3 months of follow-up were excluded. The main outcome measure - the mean absolute difference between the target and final refraction - was compared using a linear mixed model. Results Phacoemulsification surgeries performed by 4 residents before (n = 223) and by 4 residents after (n = 242) a biometry curriculum was implemented were reviewed. All measured preoperative factors were similar in both groups, including age, visual acuity, axial length, steep and flat keratometry values, astigmatism, anterior chamber depth, and lens thickness. Before the biometry course was instituted, 10% of patients had a mean absolute difference of less than 0.25 diopter (D); the percentage was 35% afterward. The mean absolute difference was less than 0.50 D in 40% before the curriculum was initiated and 70% after. The mean absolute difference was less than 1.00 D in 75% before the curriculum was initiated versus 94% after (all P <.05). The corrected distance visual acuities were similar in both groups, with 83% and 80%, respectively, having an acuity of at least 20/25 (P >.05). Conclusion Residents' refractive predictions significantly improved after a formal biometry curriculum, showing that improvements in resident surgical outcomes are possible with structured curriculums reinforcing outcome measures.

The aquatic macrophytes excel in permanently flooded areas, particularly Nymphaeaceae species. Victoria amazonica, popularly known as the vitória-régia, is hallmarked for its beauty. However, the biology and conditions necessary for the seed germination of this flowering plant remain unknown. In the present study, the fruit and seed morphology and biometry were described and the seed germination was evaluated under different abiotic conditions. To this end, mature fruits of V. amazonica were collected from the bays near Paraguay River in the south Pantanal floodplain. The fruits and seeds were described and measured using digital caliper. Intact and mechanically scarified seeds were germinated under different temperature, light and substratum conditions, and the initial development was described. The fruits measured 67.5 x 119.7 mm in size and contained 100-700 seeds. The average seed measured 10.6 mm in length and 9.8 mm in width. The highest germination occurred at 25ºC, independent of the light condition. The seeds were considered neutral photoblastic. The seedlings showed heterophylly, and the main root was degenerated, forming adventitious roots. Morphological differences were observed in seedlings developed under different light conditions. © 2016, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

Setting Tertiary eyecare facility. Design Prospective evaluation of a diagnostic test. Methods Eyes of patients had 3 consecutive scans acquired by the same operator. The repeatability of measurements was assessed using the within-subject standard deviation and coefficient of variation (CoV). Agreement between the mean measurements of each machine was evaluated. Results The study comprised 100 eyes of 100 patients. The median lens thickness and axial length (AL) measurements were significantly greater (P <.001) with SS-OCT (4.29 mm and 23.5 mm, respectively, versus 4.25 mm and 23.4 mm, respectively); anterior chamber depth (ACD) was greater with OLCR (2.72 mm versus 2.70 mm, respectively) (P <.001). The within-subject standard deviation and CoV of the AL (0.01 and 0.05, respectively) and the ACD (0.04 and 1.22, respectively) measurements showed lower variability with SS-OCT (0.05 and 0.21, respectively, for AL; 0.06 and 1.99, respectively, for ACD) than with OLCR. Good agreement was seen for anterior segment measurements between the 2 devices. The 95% limits of agreement of most parameters fell within the test-retest variability of the parameters. The SS-OCT biometer also showed better penetration in dense posterior subcapsular cataracts, measuring AL successfully in 96% of cases. Conclusions The new SS-OCT biometer showed good repeatability and agreement with the OLCR biometer.

Methods This prospective clinical study included 100 eyes of 100 patients who underwent vitrectomy alone or phacovitrectomy for macula-off retinal detachment. All patients included signed an informed consent. Preoperative examination of the patients included recording the axial length measurements using optical biometry, A-scan ultrasound, and combined applanation vector-A/B-scan biometry. Results The mean postoperative IOLMaster axial length after macular reattachment was 26.11 ± 2.91 mm. The mean preoperative IOLMaster axial length with macula-off was 25.32 ± 2.72 mm. The mean preoperative A-scan axial length with macula-off was 25.29 ± 2.80 mm. The mean preoperative vector-A/B-scan axial length with macula-off was 26.03 ± 2.90 mm.

Methods: A retrospective consecutive non-randomised case series of patients receiving the MPlus® IOL following cataract surgery or clear lens extraction was performed at a privately owned ophthalmic hospital, Midland Eye, Solihull, UK. Analysis was undertaken of 116 eyes, with uncomplicated lens replacement surgery using the LENTIS™ MPlus® lenses. Pre-operative biometry data were stratified into short (&lt;22.00 mm) and long axial lengths (ALs) (≥22.00 mm). IOL power predictions were calculated with SRK/T, Holladay I, Hoffer Q, Holladay II and Haigis formulae and compared to the final manifest refraction. These were compared with the OKULIX ray tracing method and the stratification technique suggested by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth). Results: Using SRK/T for long eyes and Hoffer Q for short eyes, 64% achieved postoperative subjective refractions of ≤±0.25 D, 83% ≤ ±0.50 D and 93% ≤ ±0.75 D, with a maximum predictive error of 1.25 D. No specific calculation method performed best across all ALs; however for ALs under 22 mm Hoffer Q and Holliday I methods performed best. Conclusions: Excellent but equivalent overall refractive results were found between all biometry methods used in this multifocal IOL study. For eyes with ALs under 22 mm Hoffer Q and Holliday I performed best. Current techniques mean that patients are still likely to need top up glasses for certain situations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Formula; Intraocular; Multifocal; Optimisation; Ray; Tracing","Article; biometry; case study; cataract; cataract extraction; controlled study; eye refraction; human; lens implant; lens power; major clinical study; prediction; priority journal; retrospective study; visual acuity; devices; lens implant; lens implantation; nomogram; optics; physiology; reproducibility; spectacles; standards; Biometry; Cataract Extraction; Eyeglasses; Humans; Lens Implantation, Intraocular; Lenses, Intraocular; Nomograms; Optics and Photonics; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Visual Acuity"

Methods Charts of 23 patients (35 eyes) with at least 6 months' postoperative follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. Evaluation included preoperative and postoperative cycloplegic and manifest refractions, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit-lamp examination, fundoscopy, corneal topography, and biometry. Results Mean UCVA was 1.67 ± 0.30 (1.17-2.00) for all 35 eyes preoperatively and 0.35 ± 0.25 (0.00-1.00) postoperatively (p < 0.001; 95% CI 1.21-1.44). BCVA had a mean of 0.31 ± 0.26 for all 35 eyes preoperatively, and a mean of 0.22 ± 0.25 postoperatively (p < 0.001; 95% CI 0.04-0.14). Haptic migration into the superior PI was noted in 8 eyes (23%). The first migration was noted 2 years postoperatively and the last 8 years after implantation (mean, 5.6 ± 2 years). There was no statistically significant difference in the BCVA and UCVA before and after haptic migration. Follow-up ranged from 8 months to 8.5 years. Conclusions Angle-supported PAC-IOL implantation resulted in significant improvement in both UCVA and BCVA. However, there is a 23% incidence of haptic migration in our series with no sequelae on BCVA or harmful effect on the intraocular structures.

Although a large amount of RNA-seq data were produced for two-group comparison with small sample sizes at early stage, more and more RNA-seq data are being produced in the setting of complex experimental designs such as split-plot designs and repeated measure designs. Data arising from such experiments are traditionally analyzed by mixed-effects models. Therefore an appropriate statistical approach for analyzing RNA-seq data from such designs should be generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) or similar approaches that allow for random effects. However, common practices for analyzing such data in literature either treat random effects as fixed or completely ignore the experimental design and focus on two-group comparison using partial data. In this paper, we examine the effect of ignoring the random effects when analyzing RNA-seq data. We accomplish this goal by comparing the standard GLMM model to the methods that ignore the random effects through simulation studies and real data analysis. Our studies show that, ignoring random effects in a multi-factor experiment can lead to the increase of the false positives among the top selected genes or lower power when the nominal FDR level is controlled. © 2016 by De Gruyter.","generalized linear mixed models; method comparison; multifactor experiments; random effects; RNA-seq data analysis","controlled study; data analysis; experimental design; model; statistical model; biometry; gene expression profiling; high throughput sequencing; procedures; sequence analysis; statistics and numerical data; Biometry; Gene Expression Profiling; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Linear Models; Models, Statistical; Sequence Analysis, RNA"

We determined whether human ocular lens position is influenced by gravity. Methods. Anterior chamber depth (ACD) and lens thickness (LT) were determined with a Haag-Streit Lenstar LS900 for right eyes of participants in two age groups, with a young group of 13 participants aged 18 to 21 years (mean, 21 years; SD, 1 year) and an older group of 10 participants aged 50 to 63 years (mean, 58 years; SD, 4 years). There were two sessions for each participant separated by at least 48 hours, with one session for the usual upright head position and one session for a downwards head position. In a session, testing was done for minimum accommodation followed by testing at maximum accommodation. A drop of 2% pilocarpine nitrate was instilled, and testing was repeated after 30 minutes under minimum and maximum accommodation conditions. Results. Gravity, manipulated through head posture, affected ACD for young adult and older adult groups but mean effects were only small, ranging from 0.04 to 0.12 mm, and for the older group required the instillation of an accommodation-stimulating drug. Gravity had a weakly significant effect on LT for the young group without accommodation or a drug, but the effect was small at 0.04 ± 0.06 mm (mean ± SD, P = 0.04). Conclusions. There is a small but real effect of gravity on crystalline lens position, manifested as reduction in ACD at high levels of accommodative effort with the head in a downwards position.

SPSS 17.0 was used in performing statistical analysis.RESULTS: There were 109 severe and 135 mild cases among all the 244 HFMD cases. The number of enterovirus positive stool samples was 229, with positive rate as 93.85%. EV71, Cox A16 and Cox A10 made up 83.84%, 5.68% and 8.30% of the enterovirus etiologicy, strains, respectively. EV71 infection caused 8 HFMD cases with heart-lung failure and 2 death, Cox A10 infection led to 1 HFMD case with heart-lung failure and death. There were statistically differences seen regarding the enterovirus infection rates between severe and the mild HFMD cases (χ(2)=5.312,P=0.021). Statistically significant difference was seen in the constituent ratio of EV71, Cox A16 and the others by Fisher' s exact test (P=0.048). There was statistically significant difference seen between the cardiorespiratory failure rate and the fatality rate by EV71 and Cox A10 infection (χ(2)=0.051,P=0.821; χ(2)=2.198,P=0.138). Cox A10 strains idenfied in Henan in 2014 belonged to genotype 6. The rates on homology of nucleotide and amino acid among the Cox A10 strains in Henan in 2014 were 94.3%-99.7% and 96.3%-100.0% respectively.CONCLUSIONS: EV71 still remained the most common pathogen that causing severe HFMD in children, with the increasing Cox A10 percentage in the pathogens spectrum of HFMD infection. Cox A10 strains in Henan in 2014 belonged to genotype 6. Genotype 6 Cox A10 had appeared and widely distributed in Henan for long time, but not yet variated or reconstructed. Cox A10 infection could lead to cardio-respiratory failure thus called for the monitoring program on non-EV71 and non-Cox A16 enterovirus, especially Cox A10 to be strenthened.",,"amino acid; biometry; child; classification; Enterovirus A; Enterovirus Infections; genetics; genotype; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; hospital; human; isolation and purification; molecular evolution; real time polymerase chain reaction; statistics and numerical data; virology; Amino Acids; Biometry; Child; Enterovirus A, Human; Enterovirus Infections; Evolution, Molecular; Genotype; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; Hospitals; Humans; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"

Methods: Four-hundred and ninety patients with healthy pregnancy were studied in a cohort study. The absolute percent error in estimation was achieved by gestation-adjusted projection method from Hadlock model for weight calculation as measure of accuracy. The mean percentage error variation over the weeks was correlated to maternal body mass index (BMI, Kg/m2) at ultrasound. The relationship between BMI and ultrasound performance was assessed by linear regression. Results: The overall proportion of supposed sonographic estimated fetal weight at birth within ±10 % of the birth weight significantly declines over the weeks (P = .016). The trend toward a progressive deterioration in ultrasound accuracy is not statistically significant for normal weight women (P = .272) but it is for over-weight/obese (P = .044). On univariate analysis, the absolute percent error and absolute error are positively related to BMI. Conclusions: Accuracy is related to the week at ultrasound scan with a gradual deterioration over the time and it worsens with increasing distance in days between the date of ultrasounds and delivery. The deterioration is greater for BMI ≥ 25. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Estimated fetal weight accuracy; Fetal weight formulas; Hadlockfetal weight; Obesity; Sonographicfetal weight estimation; Ultrasound estimated fetal weight; Ultrasound fetal weight","adult; Article; birth weight; body mass; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; female; fetus echography; fetus weight; gestation adjusted projection method; human; maternal obesity; measurement accuracy; measurement error; methodology; pregnant woman; anthropometry; biometry; body mass; fetus echography; low birth weight; newborn; obesity; physiology; predictive value; pregnancy; pregnant woman; procedures; regression analysis; standards; term birth; Adult; Anthropometry; Biometry; Birth Weight; Body Mass Index; Cohort Studies; Female; Fetal Weight; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Obesity; Overweight; Predictive Value of Tests; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Regression Analysis; Term Birth; Ultrasonography, Prenatal"

Methods: Twenty-four young adult myopes (18-28 years; 20 females, 4 males) had baseline visual acuity, accommodation, near phoria, fixation disparity and stereopsis data collected with single vision (SV) SCLs. The same set of measurements was repeated immediately after subjects were fitted with each of two MFSCLs (with either +1.50 or +3.00 D add), and after 2 weeks of daily wear in each case. The order of testing was randomised and a one-week washout period was allowed between the first and second MFSCL trials. Results: Differences in distance and near acuities with MFSCLs compared to SVSCLs were small and clinically insignificant. Compared to responses with SVSCLs, MFSCLs increased accommodative lags with this change reaching statistical significance for the +1.50 D add lens. Furthermore, both MFSCLs induced significant shifts in near phorias in the exo direction. Finally, there were no significant differences in stereopsis and fixation disparity with MFSCLs compared to SVSCLs. Conclusion: Differences in acuities, accommodation accuracy and binocular posture with MFSCLs compared to SVSCLs were clinically small and mostly not significant. These results predict good tolerance of MFSCLs in young patients fitted with them for myopia control. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Accommodation; Binocular vision; Multifocal soft contact lenses; Myopia; Myopia control","accommodation; adult; Article; astigmatism; binocular vision; biometry; clinical article; controlled study; eye fixation; female; human; male; multifocal soft contact lens; myopia; priority journal; refraction error; soft contact lens; stereoscopic vision; visual acuity; young adult; accommodation; adolescent; binocular vision; depth perception; drug effects; hydrophilic contact lens; myopia; pathophysiology; physiology; visual acuity; Accommodation, Ocular; Adolescent; Adult; Contact Lenses, Hydrophilic; Depth Perception; Female; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Male; Myopia; Vision Disparity; Vision, Binocular; Visual Acuity; Young Adult"

Astigmatism was further analyzed as against-the-rule (ATR: steepest meridian 180±30°), with-the-rule (WTR: 90±30°), and oblique (OB: 30-60°or 120-150°).RESULTS: Mean age, AL, and ACD were 72.28±13.84 years, 23.99±1.85 mm and 3.08 ±0.52 mm, respectively. In all, 20.4% eyes had ≤0.50 diopters (D), 55.2% had 0.51-1.50 D, 7.9% had 2.01-3.00 D, and 3.7% eyes had >3.00 D of astigmatism. Overall, 44.2% of eyes had corneal astigmatism >1.00 D. Average astigmatism in age ranges 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, and 90+ years were 0.82, 1.04, 1.04, 1.02, 1.15 and 2.01 D, respectively. The magnitude of preoperative astigmatism positively correlated with age (P<0.0001), with increasing and decreasing prevalence of ATR and WTR astigmatism, respectively, with advancing age. The magnitude of ATR astigmatism inversely correlates to AL (P<0.0001). ATR astigmatism is more prevalent with increasing magnitude of astigmatism (P<0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: A majority of patients for cataract surgery have astigmatism between 0.51 and 1.5 D. ATR astigmatism increases, whereas WTR decreases with age. ATR astigmatism inversely correlates to AL. With increasing age, the magnitude of astigmatism increases and ATR astigmatism becomes increasingly prevalent.

Assessing the contribution of the valve as a portion to total ventricular load is essential for the aging population. A CT scan for one patient was used to create one in vivo tricuspid aortic valve geometry and assessed with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD simulated the pressure, velocity, and flow rate, which were used to assess the Gorlin formula and continuity equation, current clinical diagnostic standards. The results demonstrate an underestimation of the anatomic orifice area (AOA) by Gorlin formula and overestimation of AOA by the continuity equation, using peak velocities, as would be measured clinically by Doppler echocardiography. As a result, we suggest that the Gorlin formula is unable to achieve the intended estimation of AOA and largely underestimates AOA at the critical low-flow states present in heart failure. The disparity in the use of echocardiography with the continuity equation is due to the variation in velocity profile between the outflow tract and the valve orifice. Comparison of time-averaged orifice areas by Gorlin and continuity with instantaneous orifice areas by planimetry can mask the errors of these methods, which is a result of the assumption that the blood flow is inviscid. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Anatomic orifice area; Aortic stenosis; Computational fluid dynamics; Computed tomography; Doppler echocardiography; Effective orifice area; Gorlin; In vivo; Pressure recovery","Blood vessels; Cardiology; Computational geometry; Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Diseases; Echocardiography; Fluid dynamics; Orifices; Aortic stenosis; Doppler echocardiography; Effective orifice areas; Gorlin; In-vivo; Orifice area; Pressure recovery; Computational fluid dynamics; aging population; anatomy; biometry; blood; cardiovascular disease; computational fluid dynamics; disease treatment; equation; numerical model; tomography; velocity profile"

The soft tissues in the airway of OSA patients are prone to collapse under the low-pressure loads incurred during breathing. This paper describes efforts toward the development of a numerical tool for simulation of air–tissue interactions in the upper airway of patients with sleep apnea. A procedure by which patient-specific airway geometries are segmented and processed from dental cone-beam CT scans into signed distance fields is presented. A sharp-interface embedded boundary method based on the signed distance field is used on Cartesian grids for resolving the airflow in the airway geometries. For simulation of structure mechanics with large expected displacements, a cut-cell finite element method with nonlinear Green strains is used. The fluid and structure solvers are strongly coupled with a partitioned iterative algorithm. Preliminary results are shown for flow simulation inside the three-dimensional rigid upper airway of patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Two validation cases for the fluid–structure coupling problem are also presented. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biomedical flows; Fluid–structure interaction; Immersed boundary method","Algorithms; Computational fluid dynamics; Computerized tomography; Finite element method; Iterative methods; Object recognition; Respiratory mechanics; Tissue; Turbulent flow; Biomedical flows; Embedded boundary methods; Immersed boundary methods; Iterative algorithm; Obstructive sleep apnea; Signed distance fields; Structure mechanics; Tissue interactions; Sleep research; airflow; biometry; cells and cell components; disease incidence; finite element method; fluid dynamics; numerical model; sleep"

Methods In this observational study, 100 normal candidates underwent Scheimpflug analysis with Sirius 3D Rotating Scheimpflug Camera and Topography System (Costruzione Strumenti Oftalmici, Italy). Two scans in dark room conditions were performed by the same experienced user. The candidates were asked to keep both eyes closed for 5 min before the scans. Exclusion criteria were previous ocular surgery, corneal scarring and anterior segment/posterior segment anomalies. Only the right eyes were used for the analysis. Both corneal (central, minimum, and apical thickness, volume, horizontal visible iris diameter, and apical curvature) and anterior chamber (volume, depth, angle, horizontal diameter) measurements were evaluated. Results There was no difference in the means of repeated measurements (p > 0.05, ANOVA). Intraclass correlations between the measures were high and ranged from 0.995-0.997 for corneal to 0.964-0.997 for anterior chamber (AC) parameters. The precision of repeatability measures (1.96 × Sw) was approximately 5 μ for the central and minimum corneal thickness, 8 μ for the apical corneal thickness, 0.06 mm for AC (anterior chamber) depth and less than 2° for the AC angle.

Methods: An adaptive optics (AO) retinal camera (rtx1.; Imagine Eyes, Orsay, France) was used to acquire images of parafoveal cones from patients with type II diabetes mellitus with or without retinopathy and from healthy controls with no known systemic or ocular disease. Cone mosaic was captured at 0° and 2°eccentricities along the horizontal and vertical meridians. The density of the parafoveal cones was calculated within 100×100-μm squares located at 500-μm from the foveal center along the orthogonal meridians. Manual corrections of the automated counting were then performed by 2 masked graders. Cone density measurements were evaluated with ANOVA that consisted of one between-subjects factor, stage of retinopathy and the within-subject factors. The ANOVA model included a complex covariance structure to account for correlations between the levels of the within-subject factors. Results: Ten healthy participants (20 eyes) and 25 patients (29 eyes) with type II diabetes mellitus were recruited in the study. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age of the healthy participants (Control group), patients with diabetes without retinopathy (No DR group), and patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR group) was 55 ± 8, 53 ± 8, and 52 ± 9 years, respectively. The cone density was significantly lower in the moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and severe NPDR/proliferative DR groups compared to the Control, No DR, and mild NPDR groups (P &lt; 0.05). No correlation was found between cone density and the level of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or the duration of diabetes. Conclusions: The extent of photoreceptor loss on AO imaging may correlate positively with severity of DR in patients with type II diabetes mellitus. Photoreceptor loss may be more pronounced among patients with advanced stages of DR due to higher risk of macular edema and its sequelae. © 2016 Soliman et al.

We aim to assess the effect of AL on the skin parameters through biometric devices to determine whether it has positive effects on treated region. In this pretest-posttest study, we recruited patients who attended Laser Clinic of Skin and Stem Cell Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, from January through December 2014. Patients had to be free of any dermatologic conditions and lesion at the site of treatment or any contraindication to laser therapy. Baseline measurements were performed and patients received four sessions of AL therapy (spot size, 12 mm; fluence, 12 J/cm2; and pulse width, 5 Hz) with 4-week intervals. Four weeks after the last treatment session, the same parameters were assessed that included skin color, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), dermis and epidermis density and depth (through skin ultrasonography), melanin content, erythema intensity, and skin elasticity. Biometric parameters of 33 patients (27 females [81.8 %]), with mean (SD) age of 35.7 (9.5) years were evaluated. The mean percent changes of skin parameters were as follows: skin color, 5.88 % through Visioface and by 56.8 % through Colorimeter devices (became lighter); melanin content, −15.95 %; TEWL, −2.96 %; elasticity, +14.88 %; dermis depth −19.01 %; and dermis density, +1580.11 % (P &lt; 0.001 for changes in each parameter). AL could decrease melanin content of the skin and make the skin thinner while it could increase elasticity and density of epidermis and dermis, which might indicate increased collagen content of skin. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.","Alexandrite laser; Elasticity; Insensible Water loss; Melanin","hydrocortisone; melanin; zinc oxide; adult; alexandrite laser; Article; biometry; clinical article; dermis; echography; elasticity; epidermis; erythema; esthetic surgery; female; human; hypertrichosis; Iran; male; pretest posttest design; priority journal; skin color; skin colorimeter; skin elasticity; skin function; skin water loss; skinfold thickness; adverse effects; erythema; hair removal; low level laser therapy; middle aged; pathology; Radiation Injuries; radiation response; skin; skin pigmentation; solid state laser; therapeutic use; treatment outcome; Adult; Elasticity; Erythema; Female; Hair Removal; Humans; Iran; Lasers, Solid-State; Low-Level Light Therapy; Male; Middle Aged; Radiation Injuries; Skin; Skin Pigmentation; Treatment Outcome"

This study examined genetic, environmental, and prenatal hormonal influences on individual differences in personality masculinity-femininity (M-F). We used Big-Five personality inventory data of 9,520 Swedish twins (aged 27 to 54) to create a bipolar M-F personality scale. Using biometrical twin modeling, we estimated the influence of genetic and environmental factors on individual differences in a M-F personality score. Furthermore, we tested whether prenatal hormone transfer may influence individuals' M-F scores by comparing the scores of twins with a same-sex versus those with an opposite-sex co-twin. On average, males scored 1.09 standard deviations higher than females on the created M-F scale. Around a third of the variation in M-F personality score was attributable to genetic factors, while family environmental factors had no influence. Males and females from opposite-sex pairs scored significantly more masculine (both approximately 0.1 SD) than those from same-sex pairs. In conclusion, genetic influences explain part of the individual differences in personality M-F, and hormone transfer from the male to the female twin during pregnancy may increase the level of masculinization in females. Additional well-powered studies are needed to clarify this association and determine the underlying mechanisms in both sexes. © The Author(s) 2016.","genes; heritability; hormone transfer; masculinity; personality; sex-differences; twin study","adult; Article; biological model; biometry; cohort analysis; controlled study; environmental factor; female; femininity; genetic screening; heredity; hormone action; human; male; masculinity; monozygotic twins; personality; prenatal period; priority journal; psychological rating scale; scoring system; sex difference; sex hormone determination; Swedish citizen; dizygotic twins; environment; genetics; middle aged; pathophysiology; personality; personality disorder; pregnancy; sexual development; Sweden; Adult; Environment; Female; Femininity; Humans; Male; Masculinity; Middle Aged; Personality; Personality Disorders; Pregnancy; Sex Characteristics; Sweden; Twins, Dizygotic; Twins, Monozygotic"

Cattle identification and tracking refers to the process of accurately recognizing individual cattle and their products via a unique identifier or marker. Classical cattle identification and tracking methods such as ear tags, branding, tattooing, and electrical methods have long been in use; however, their performance is limited due to their vulnerability to losses, duplications, fraud, and security challenges. Owing to their uniqueness, immutability, and low costs, biometric traits mapped into animal identification systems have emerged as a promising trend. Biometric identifiers for beef animals include muzzle print images, iris patterns, and retinal vascular patterns. Although using biometric identifiers has replaced human experts with computerized systems, it raises additional challenges in terms of identifier capturing, identification accuracy, processing time, and overall system operability. This article reviews the evolution in cattle identification and tracking from classical methods to animal biometrics. It reports on traditional animal identification methods and their advantages and problems. Moreover, this article describes the deployment of biometric identifiers for effectively identifying beef animals. The article presents recent research findings in animal biometrics, with a strong focus on cattle biometric identifiers such as muzzle prints, iris patterns, and retinal vascular patterns. A discussion of current challenges involved in the biometric-based identification systems appears in the conclusions, which may drive future research directions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Beef animals; Biometrics science; Cattle identification; Cattle tracking; Iris patterns; Muzzle prints; Retinal vascular patterns","Beef; Biometrics; Meats; Ophthalmology; Animal identification; Animal identification systems; Cattle tracking; Future research directions; Identification accuracy; Iris patterns; Production management; Vascular patterns; Animals; biometry; cattle; computer; eye; identification method; ownership; research work; tagging; tracking; Animalia; Bos"

Within a given species, individuals might differ in their propensity to use such a tactic, in a similar manner to which they differ in their general level of aggressiveness. Standard metabolic rate is often viewed as a proxy for energy requirements. For this reason, it should directly impact on both kleptoparasitism and aggressiveness when individuals have to share the same food source. In the present study we first assessed the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of 128 juvenile European eels (Anguilla anguilla) by the determination of oxygen consumption. We then tested how the SMR could influence agonistic behavior of individuals competing for food in three distinct trials evenly distributed over three months. We demonstrate that SMR positively correlates with attacks (sum of bite and push events) in all trials. Similarly SMR correlated positively with kleptoparasitism (food theft), but this was significant only for the third trial (month 3). To our knowledge, the present study is the first reporting a link between kleptoparasitism and SMR in a fish species. This has ecological implications owing to the fact that this species is characterized by an environmental sex determination linked to early growth rate. We discuss theses findings in the light of the producer-scrounger foraging game. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Aggressiveness; Eel; Fish; Kleptoparasitism; Producer-scrounger; SMR","aggression; aggressiveness; Anguilla anguilla; Article; bite; correlational study; foraging; growth rate; kleptoparasitism; metabolic rate; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; priority journal; sex determination; theft; animal; basal metabolic rate; biometry; eel; feeding behavior; physiology; season; species difference; antidote; Aggression; Animals; Antidotes; Basal Metabolism; Biometry; Eels; Feeding Behavior; Seasons; Species Specificity"

Setting: Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo-SP, Brazil. Design: Prospective observational non-randomised, non-comparative study. Methods: Forty-seven patients (63 eyes) were indicated for the use of Esclera® SCL. All patients underwent Scheimpflug imaging before the initial SCL evaluation. The following parameters were measured by Pentacam: corneal elevations, thickness, density, and anterior chamber depth (ACD). Correlations between the SCL parameters and the Pentacam measurements were analysed with Pearson's correlation coefficients. A simple linear regression model was created for each lens parameter using the most-correlated Pentacam variable. Results: In the total group, the results show correlations between the SCL parameters and the corneal astigmatism, ACD and pentacam-measured corneal height (Hm), with p &lt; 0.001 each. In addition, an inverse correlation between the lens sagittal depth (LSD) and the anterior radii minimum was shown (p &lt; 0.001). In the keratoconus group, the results show correlations between the SCL parameters and ACD and Hm (p &lt; 0.001, each). An inverse correlation between the LSD and the total thickness corneal density average was also observed (p = 0.003). Conclusion: There was a positive correlation between the LSD and ACD, even as LD and ACD in the keratoconus group. Thus, these results suggest that certain Pentacam measurements can be good predictors of the most appropriate Esclera lens to be fitted in keratoconus patients. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Contact lens; Dry eye; Keratoconus; Scheimpflug camera; Scleral lens fitting; Scleral lenses","adult; anterior eye chamber depth; Article; astigmatism; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; cornea dystrophy; cornea thickness; dry eye; female; human; keratoconus; male; ophthalmic camera; pellucid marginal degeneration; penetrating keratoplasty; priority journal; prospective study; Scheimpflug camera; scleral contact lens; treatment indication; adolescent; anatomic model; biometry; contact lens; corneal pachymetry; devices; Dry Eye Syndromes; eye; keratoconus; keratometry; middle aged; pathology; photography; procedures; prosthetic fitting; sclera; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Biometry; Contact Lenses; Corneal Pachymetry; Corneal Topography; Dry Eye Syndromes; Eye; Female; Humans; Keratoconus; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Anatomic; Photography; Prospective Studies; Prosthesis Fitting; Sclera; Young Adult"

In addition, the direction and potential significance of the observed changes is speculated. Feulgen-stained neutrophils are pictured and their digitalized images are analyzed in specialized software for digital image processing and ImageJ analysis. Significant statistical difference is observed (p<0.01) between UV-treated neutrophils and controls in the vast majority of cytoplasmic morphometric parameters. Nuclear GLCM analysis was very sensitive with just GLCM homogeneity as non-significant between UV-treated cells and controls (p>0.05). For other parameters there was mostly high statistical significance (p>0.05). Significant unmatched correlations were found as sensitive markers of early morphological changes in cells exposed to UV light. In addition, the correlation between nuclear area and entropy was determined and was highly significant (p<0.001). UVB light, due to its high absorbance by DNA molecules, leads to double behavior of the cells. On one hand, cells start to rearrange but on the other UV light starts very early to immediately damage the cell. All these processes are very subtle in their intensity and GLCM analysis and computational imaging methods based on fractal geometry, i.e. fractal and morphometric analysis, in particular their combination, are very sensitive for detecting and describing these early chromatin changes. © Microscopy Society of America 2016.","computational morphometric analysis; fractal analysis; gray-level co-occurrence matrix analysis; lacunarity analysis; neutrophil granulocytes","chromatin; biometry; cell nucleus; chromatin; cytology; cytoplasm; image processing; neutrophil; radiation response; surface property; ultrastructure; ultraviolet radiation; Biometry; Cell Nucleus; Chromatin; Cytoplasm; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neutrophils; Surface Properties; Ultraviolet Rays"

S. libidinosus has a larger population and distribution, coexisting with S. flavius in Paraíba, however living in the western part of the state, in the semi-arid. Since there is a lack of knowledge about these species, a morphologic description of them was made, involving external and gastrointestinal tract biometry, visceral topography and anatomic description.

Setting Spektrum Eye Clinic, Wrocław, Poland. Design Prospective comparative study. Methods Anterior segment parameters were examined before and after phacoemulsification in 3 groups of eyes as follows: short (axial length [AL] <22.0 mm), normal (AL 22.5 to 25.0 mm), and long (AL> 25.5 mm) with optical biometry based on partial coherence interferometry (IOLMaster) and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (Visante). Results The study comprised 20 short eyes, 22 normal eyes, and 19 long eyes. The anterior chamber angle increased after surgery in all eyes (P <.05). The relative change in anterior chamber depth (ACD) was larger in short eyes (57%) than in normal eyes (44%) or long eyes (42%) (P <.017). The change in iris position after phacoemulsification was larger in short eyes than in normal or long eyes (mean change 0.93 mm, 0.70 mm, and 0.43 mm, respectively) (P <.017). The change in lens position after phacoemulsification in relation to the iris was smaller in short eyes (mean 0.51 mm) than in normal or long eyes (mean 0.82 mm and 1.10 mm, respectively) (P <.017). Conclusions The relative change in ACD after phacoemulsification was larger in short eyes than in normal eyes and long eyes. The largest change in iris position occurred in short eyes. The largest change in the lens versus the intraocular lens (IOL) position occurred in long eyes, with the IOL moving back from the iris. Optical biometry might underestimate the postoperative ACD.

Among them, Sicydium punctatum Perugia, 1896, which is endemic to the West Indies, represents the vast majority of fish in these rivers. The otolith microstructure and the biometry of S. punctatum postlarvae from Guadeloupe were investigated to explore the dispersal modalities of this species through an appreciation of the growth pattern, the pelagic larval duration (PLD) and the size-at-recruitment. The study was made on one cohort of 83 recruited postlarvae, fished at the Capesterre River's mouth on 2 November 2011. The mean (±SD) size-at-recruitment of the postlarvae was 24.6 ± 1.3 mm (range of 20.5-28.1 mm, n = 83). We found a mean (±SD) PLD of 72.2 ± 10.5 days (range of 54-101.5 days, n = 67). The growth rate estimated from the otolith increments showed a globally decreasing pattern during the marine larval phase. Growth rates at the beginning of the larval stage were significantly different between hatching periods, suggesting a relation between the hatching period and the growth rate in S. punctatum. This study adds on to the general understanding of the life cycle of S. punctatum in Guadeloupe that will help implement strategies to manage amphidromous fish populations in the Caribbean region. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Amphidromy; Larval dispersal; Lesser Antilles; Otolith; Sicydiinae",

This species group was comprehensively studied here using traditional biometry, geometric morphometrics, ecological niche modelling, and genetics. Our analyses revealed that E.persicus is split into two clades. A western clade, bearing at least two different species: E.persicus, distributed in south-western Iran, and an undescribed species from south-eastern Turkey and western Iran. The eastern clade consists of at least three species: Eirenis nigrofasciatus, distributed across north-eastern Iraq, and western and southern Iran; Eirenis walteri, distributed across eastern Iran, southern Turkmenistan, and western and southern Pakistan, and Eirenis angusticeps, distributed in north-eastern Pakistan. Ecological niche modelling revealed that the distribution of the species in the western clade are mainly affected by winter precipitation, and those in the eastern clade are mainly affected by the minimum temperature of the coldest month. A molecular clock analysis revealed that the divergence and diversification of the E.persicus species group mainly correspond to Eocene to Pliocene orogeny events subsequent to the Arabia-Eurasia collision. This study confirms that specimens with the unique morphology of having 13 dorsal scale rows on the anterior dorsum, occurring in the Suleiman Mountains in central Pakistan, can be referred to Eirenis mcmahoni (Wall, 1911).

The aim of the presented study was to analyse the possibility to influence the time of surgery. Material and Method: Data from 30 neonates with EA and TEF regarding the date and mode of birth, biometric data and preoperative acid-base and blood gas values were collected retrospectively. The newborns were divided into two subgroups: birth between Monday and Thursday (""week""), and birth from Friday to Sunday (""weekend""). Results: We observed a seasonal peak of births in November/December. The rate of prenatal ultrasound detection of polyhydramnions was 40%. In 14 of 16 cases with Caesarean section, maternal or foetal problems predicted the date and mode of delivery. In both groups, most newborns had an unimpaired postnatal adaptation. There were no significant differences regarding biometry. Delivery at the weekend was associated with later surgical repair (second vs. first day of life). Repeated estimations of acid-base and blood gas parameters over a median time span of 13 hours revealed a stable situation with a trend to normalisation. Discussion: The time of birth is multifactorial and, in most cases, can neither be predicted nor influenced. Stable respiratory and metabolic parameters in the majority of patients allow a surgical intervention within a limited time frame during the first days of life. Conclusion: As it is hardly possible to plan the surgical procedure, an experienced team as well as neonatal intensive care facilities and operation room access must be available throughout the week. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG.","esophageal atresia; respiratory status; surgical repair; time management","acid base balance; age; blood gas analysis; cross-sectional study; Esophageal Atresia; female; Germany; health care delivery; health service; human; male; newborn; retrospective study; risk factor; task performance; tracheoesophageal fistula; Acid-Base Equilibrium; Age Factors; Blood Gas Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Esophageal Atresia; Female; Germany; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Time and Motion Studies; Tracheoesophageal Fistula"

Now a days, several voice based biometry authentication systems are available to comply the requirements of our daily needs. The overall performances of these systems are totally based on the complexity of each part of the algorithm. Voice Activity Detector (VAD) is one of such relevant part. It can be designed in time domain as well as frequency domain. Time domain VAD have low complexity than the frequency domain or, other domain, like, wavelet transform domain based VAD. Normally, VAD is used to remove the silence portions from the speech signal and a suitable VAD must have high speech activity detection rate (HR1) and high non-speech detection rate (HR0). HP1 and HP0 are quantitative measurement of VAD accuracy to enumerate the speech, and silence part correctly from a speech signal. In this paper, we consider only time domain VAD for clean speech but, the existing time domain based VAD algorithms are not suitable to meet both of them simultaneously. Therefore, we design an unsupervised VAD algorithm which has high HR1, as well as, high HR0. The main advantage of unsupervised data segmentation is that no prior threshold information is required. Here, we use K-mean as an unsupervised clustering technique. In this paper, we compare different time domain voice activity detectors with our proposed VAD which we call it KVD(K-mean Voice-activity Detector). The results of that comparison show the highest performance of our proposed VAD. © 2015 IEEE.","ALED; K-mean; LED; VAD; WFD; ZVD",

At 3 months postoperatively, the subject’s vision was tested both uncorrected and with his/her best distance correction at: distance (4 m), intermediate (63 cm), and near (40 cm). Binocular defocus curves were measured with no correction and with the subject’s best distance correction in place. Quality of vision was measured using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire.Results: A total of 22 patients were enrolled (eleven in each group). There was no statistically significant difference in the absolute change in measured rotation between 1 month and 3 months postoperatively between the two intraocular lens (IOL) groups (P=0.98). At 3 months, the postoperative refraction and distance VA by eye were similar between groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the measured LCVA between groups (P=0.39). The defocus curve showed that at 67 cm, the trifocal toric lens had statistically significantly better VA when compared to the bifocal toric lens. There were no statistically significant differences by group for any of the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire scores (P.0.26 in all cases).Conclusion: The trifocal toric IOL improved the intermediate vision without negatively impacting visual function and distance, near, or low-contrast VA when compared to a bifocal toric IOL. The toric component of the trifocal lens effectively reduced astigmatism and provided good rotational stability. © 2016 Prospero Ponce et al.","Astigmatism; Contrast sensitivity; Defocus curve; FineVision; Multifocal; ReSTOR","adult; Article; astigmatism; biometry; clinical article; controlled study; diffractive apodized bifocal toric intraocular lens; diffractive trifocal toric intraocular lens; eye axis length; eye refraction; female; human; intermethod comparison; keratometry; lens implant; male; National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire score; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; presbyopia; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; slit lamp; vision; visual acuity"

Methods: In this paper, we propose a new nonparametric test with a simple test statistic to compare median survival times. Results: The results from our comprehensive simulation study show the new test controls type I error rate very well under all situations considered, even for small sample sizes. In addition, it has comparable detecting power compared to existing methods. Another advantage of the proposed test is its relatively simple formula that requires less computation. Conclusions: We propose a new statistical method for comparing survival curves based on their medians.

Mice and rats have been extensively used to study the effects of IUGR, but there are notable differences in fetal and placental physiology relative to those of humans that argue for alternative animal models. This study proposes that gradual occlusion of uterine arteries from mid-gestation in pregnant guinea pigs produces a novel model to better assess human IUGR. Fetal biometry and in vivo placental vascular function were followed by sonography and Doppler of control pregnant guinea pigs and sows submitted to surgical placement of ameroid constrictors in both uterine arteries (IUGR) at mid-gestation (35 days). The ameroid constrictors induced a reduction in the fetal abdominal circumference growth rate (0.205 cm day-1) compared to control (0.241 cm day-1, P &lt; 0.001) without affecting biparietal diameter growth. Umbilical artery pulsatility and resistance indexes at 10 and 20 days after surgery were significantly higher in IUGR animals than controls (P &lt; 0.01). These effects were associated with a decrease in the relative luminal area of placental chorionic arteries (21.3 ± 2.2% vs. 33.2 ± 2.7%, P &lt; 0.01) in IUGR sows at near term. Uterine artery intervention reduced fetal (∼30%), placental (∼20%) and liver (∼50%) weights (P &lt; 0.05), with an increased brain to liver ratio (P &lt; 0.001) relative to the control group. These data demonstrate that the ameroid constrictor implantations in uterine arteries in pregnant guinea pigs lead to placental vascular dysfunction and altered fetal growth that induces asymmetric IUGR. © 2016 The Physiological Society.",,"abdominal circumference; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anthropometric parameters; artery; artery occlusion; Article; biometry; biparietal diameter growth; brain to liver ratio; controlled study; Doppler flowmetry; echography; female; fetus growth; fetus weight; growth; growth rate; guinea pig; in vivo study; intrauterine growth retardation; liver weight; nonhuman; placenta; placenta weight; placental chorionic artery; placental vascular function; priority journal; umbilical artery; uterine artery; uterine artery occlusion; adverse effects; animal; disease model; Fetal Growth Retardation; pathology; pathophysiology; placenta circulation; pregnancy; procedures; surgery; uterine artery embolization; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Guinea Pigs; Placental Circulation; Pregnancy; Uterine Artery; Uterine Artery Embolization"

Less attention has been paid to species at lower trophic levels. The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) may be a useful model for investigating effects of POPs in mid-range trophic level species. In male house sparrows, ornamental traits involved in male quality signalling are important for female selection. These traits are governed by endocrinological systems, and POPs may therefore interfere with male quality signalling. The aim of the present study was to use the house sparrow as a mid-range trophic level model species to study the effects of environmental contaminants on endocrinology and male quality signalling. We analysed the levels of selected PCBs, PBDEs and OCPs and investigated the possible effects of these contaminants on circulating levels of steroid hormones (4 progestagens, 4 androgens and 3 estrogens) in male and female adult house sparrows from a population on the island Leka, Norway. Plasma samples were analysed for steroid hormones by GC-MS and liver samples were analysed for environmental contaminants by GC-ECD and GC-MS. In males, we also quantified ornament traits. It was hypothesised that POPs may have endocrine disrupting effects on the local house sparrow population and can thus interfere with the steroid hormone homeostasis. Among female house sparrows, bivariate correlations revealed negative relationships between POPs and estrogens. Among male sparrows, positive relationships between dihydrotestosterone levels and PCBs were observed. In males, positive relationships were also found between steroids and beak length, and between steroids and ornamental traits such as total badge size. This was confirmed by a significant OPLS model between beak length and steroids. Although sparrows are in the mid-range trophic levels, the present study indicates that POPs may affect steroid homeostasis in house sparrows, in particular for females. For males, circulating steroid levels appears to be more associated with biometric parameters related to ornamental traits. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Androgens; Blood; Estrogens; Ornamental traits; Pollution; Progestagens","Blood; Contamination; Endocrine disrupters; Endocrinology; Hormones; Houses; Impurities; Lipids; Organic compounds; Organic pollutants; Physiology; Pollution; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Androgens; Biometric parameters; Bivariate correlations; Environmental contaminant; Estrogens; Investigating effects; Ornamental traits; Progestagens; Steroid hormones; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 2,2',4,4' tetrabromodiphenyl ether; 2,2',4,4',5,5' hexabromodiphenyl ether; 2,2',4,4',5,5' hexachlorobiphenyl; androgen; androstanolone; bromodiphenyl ether 100; bromodiphenyl ether 154; bromodiphenyl ether 209; bromodiphenyl ether 28; bromodiphenyl ether 99; endocrine disruptor; estrogen; gestagen; polychlorinated biphenyl 101; polychlorinated biphenyl 118; polychlorinated biphenyl 138; polychlorinated biphenyl 180; polychlorinated biphenyl 28; polychlorinated biphenyl 52; steroid; unclassified drug; diphenyl ether derivative; endocrine disruptor; hormone; pollutant; polychlorinated biphenyl; androdioecy; biometry; blood; endocrinology; estrogenic compound; male behavior; passerine; persistent organic pollutant; pollution effect; signaling; steroid; adult; animal tissue; Article; beak; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental parameters; female; homeostasis; male; mass fragmentography; morphological trait; nonhuman; Norway; Passer domesticus; persistent organic pollutant; plasma; priority journal; quality signalling; sex difference; structure analysis; trophic level; anatomy and histology; animal; environmental monitoring; metabolism; physiology; pollutant; sparrow; toxicity; Passer domesticus; Passeridae; Androgens; Animals; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Hormones; Male; Norway; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Sparrows"

However, there is a paucity of relevant literature on the relationship between biometric and physicochemical indices of freshly harvested shrimp. This work therefore investigated the relationship between biometric (standard length (SL), total weight (TW) and condition factor (CF)) and physicochemical (moisture content, pH, titratable acidity, water activity, water retention index, colour values and fracturability) characteristics of freshly harvested Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) obtained from three different farms. The relationships between these parameters were determined using correlation and regression analyses. RESULTS: No significant correlation (P > 0.05) was found between the biometric and physicochemical indices of the sampled L. vannamei specimens. Possibly the lack of post-mortem and physical change(s) at day of harvest together with the absence of temporal variable may have collectively limited the degree of any significant correlation between biometric and physicochemical data points measured in this study. Although the TWs of freshly harvested L. vannamei shrimp resembled (P > 0.05), SL and CF differed significantly (P < 0.05) with minimal explained variance. Moreover, some biometric and physicochemical variables were independently correlated (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Data indicated that no significant correlation existed between biometric and physicochemical characteristics of freshly harvested L. vannamei shrimp. Across the farms studied, however, the biometric data were comparable. To best knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the biometric and physicochemical properties of freshly harvested shrimp using a comparative approach, which is also applicable to other economically important aquaculture species. Overall, this work provides useful information for competent authorities/stakeholders of the fishery industry and serves as a baseline for preservative treatments. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.","Biometrics; Freshly harvested shrimp; Litopenaeus vannamei; Physicochemical properties","anatomy and histology; animal; aquaculture; biometry; chemical phenomena; chemistry; comparative study; food preservation; food quality; growth, development and aging; Penaeidae; procedures; sea food; Southeast Asia; Animals; Aquaculture; Asia, Southeastern; Biometry; Chemical Phenomena; Food Preservation; Food Quality; Penaeidae; Seafood"

High quality of cataract surgery depends on preoperative precise biometry, reasonable operating scheme targeting at personality, suitable functional IOL, less intra- or post-operative complications, effectively avoiding treatment risk and correctly processing disadvantageous factors affecting postoperative visual quality.Therefore, the management of cataract surgery is a systemic procedure.The issue of improving ophthalmic examination, new cataract surgical technique and new IOL emerges as the time requires.How to make up individual-based treatment options for patients, better improve postoperative visual quality, enhance the safety of operative procedure, reduce operative complications is the challenges and unremitting goal for the ophthalmologists.

In addition, the bone flap can be left out when evacuating a mass lesion, usually an acute subdural haematoma (ASDH), in the acute phase (primary DC). Even though, the principle of ""opening the skull"" in order to control brain oedema and raised intracranial pressure has been practised since the beginning of the 20th century, the last 20 years have been marked by efforts to develop the evidence base with the conduct of randomised trials. This article discusses the merits and challenges of this approach and provides an overview of randomised trials of DC following TBI. An update on the RESCUEicp study, a randomised trial of DC versus advanced medical management (including barbiturates) for severe and refractory post-traumatic intracranial hypertension is provided.

This is the first study to include the Sicilian population of J. turbinata sensu stricto. Seven features of the cones and seeds, two of the shoots and leaves and eight ratios were used to describe the individuals and populations which were then compared using statistical methods. Four of the analysed populations (representatives of J. turbinata s.s.) are closely related to each other. The two other populations representing J. phoenicea s.s. appear to be much more variable but on the whole the two taxa treated at a species level seem to be quite distinct from each other. It was also noted that there are two quite different ecologies of these species: the first is typical of the thermomediterranean belt which is only found at high altitudes in the mountains of north Africa, and the second circumscribed to the meso- or supramediterranean belt of western Spain, France and northwestern Italy. In many parts of its coastal distribution, Juniperus turbinata is endangered due to the construction of summer resorts and therefore actions to protect this species are needed. © 2015 Società Botanica Italiana.","biogeography; biometry; Cupressaceae; Plant variation; taxonomy",

Methods: Twenty-eight adult subjects (32 pseudophakic eyes) having recently undergone cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. A custom system combining two optical coherence tomography systems with a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor was constructed to image and monitor changes in whole eye biometry, the ciliary muscle and ocular aberration in the pseudophakic eye. A Badal optical channel and a visual target aligning with the wavefront sensor were incorporated into the system for measuring the wavefront-derived refraction. The imaging acquisition was performed twice. The coefficients of repeatability (CoR) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated. Results: Images were acquired and processed successfully in all patients. No significant difference was detected between repeated measurements of ciliary muscle dimension, full-eye biometry or defocus aberration. The CoR of full-eye biometry ranged from 0.36% to 3.04%and the ICC ranged from 0.981 to 0.999. The CoR for ciliary muscle dimensions ranged from 12.2% to 41.6% and the ICC ranged from 0.767 to 0.919. The defocus aberrations of the two measurements were 0.443 ± 0.534 D and 0.447 ± 0.586 D and the ICC was 0.951. Conclusions: The combined system is capable of measuring full eye biometry and refraction with good repeatability. The system is suitable for future investigation of pseudoaccommodation in the pseudophakic eye. © 2016 Mao et al.

Twenty-nine Santa Ines lambs were used. Treatments consisted of diets with different hay: concentrate ratios (100:0-Control, 80:20- T1, 60:40-T2, 40:60-T3 and 20:80-T4). The characteristics evaluated were: body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), hearth girth (HG), body length (BL), height at withers (HW), height at rump (HR), rump width (RW), chest width (CW), scrotal perimeter (SP), testis length (TL) testis width (TW), testis thickness (TT), cauda epididymal length (CEL), cauda epididymal width (CAW), cauda epididymal thickness (CET), scrotal skin thickness (SST) and testicular volume (TV). Blood samples were collected to analyze glucose, urea, albumin, total cholesterol, total proteins, inorganic phosphate and magnesium concentrations. The body and testicular-epididymal measurements increased linearly with increases in the energy concentration in the diet. BW, BL, CW, RW, HG and BCS showed positive high correlations (r = 0.71 to 0.94) with all testis-epididymal measurements. The results of the metabolic profile study showed interactions between the addition of the concentrated feed and time of blood collection on total proteins, albumin, urea, cholesterol, phosphorus and magnesium concentrations. At the beginning of the trial, hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia were verified in T3 and T4. However, the indices returned to normal over time with the continuity in the diet supplied. Hypomagnesaemia was verified in all treatments. The plasmatic phosphorus concentration was sufficiently high at the end of all treatments, except control. In conclusion, the BL, HG, CW, RW as well as the BCS may be used to estimate the development of the testes and epididymis. The metabolic profile results verified that adjusts are necessary in the amount of concentrated feed given to the lambs when Tifton 85 hay (Cynodon spp) is provided to the animals.","Albumin.

Methods This was a screening study in 76 300, 54 999, 25 727 and 6181 singleton pregnancies at 11-13, 19-24, 30-34 and 35-37 weeks' gestation, respectively. The a-priori risk for LGA with birth weight &gt; 95th percentile (LGA &gt; 95th) was calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine which of the maternal factors had a significant contribution. Regression analysis was then used to determine whether screening by a combination of maternal factors, fetal biometry and various biophysical and biochemical markers had significant contribution in predicting delivery of LGA neonates. Results The likelihood of LGA &gt; 95th increased with increasing maternal weight and height and was lower in women of Afro-Caribbean and South Asian racial origins, in cigarette smokers and in nulliparous women. The risk was higher in women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus Type I and lower in those with chronic hypertension. In parous women, the risk increased with birth-weight Z-score in previous pregnancy and prior history of gestational diabetes and decreased with interpregnancy interval. Screening by maternal factors at 11-13 weeks predicted 32%, 44% and 60% of LGA &gt; 95th at false-positive rates (FPRs) of 5%, 10% and 20%, respectively. With the addition of fetal biometry, the detection rates improved to 37%, 51% and 68% at 19-24 weeks, 50%, 65% and 81% at 30-34 weeks and 60%, 73% and 85% at 35-37 weeks at FPRs of 5%, 10% and 20%, respectively. The addition of biomarkers did not improve the detection rates achieved when screening by a combination of maternal factors and fetal biometry. Conclusion Combined screening by maternal factors and fetal biometry can predict a high proportion of pregnancies that will deliver LGA neonates. © Copyright 2015 ISUOG.

We address the issue of what is understood by optical model eyes, discussing the 'encyclopaedia' and 'toy train' approaches to modelling. An extensive list of purposes of models is provided. We discuss many of the theoretical types of optical models (also schematic eyes) of varying anatomical accuracy, including single, three and four refracting surface variants. We cover the models with lens structure in the form of nested shells and gradient index. Many optical eye models give accurate predictions only for small angles and small fields of view. If aberrations and image quality are important to consider, such 'paraxial' model eyes must be replaced by 'finite model' eyes incorporating features such as aspheric surfaces, tilts and decentrations, wavelength-dependent media and curved retinas. Many optical model eyes are population averages and must become adaptable to account for age, gender, ethnicity, refractive error and accommodation. They can also be customised for the individual when extensive ocular biometry and optical performance data are available. We consider which optical model should be used for a particular purpose, adhering to the principle that the best model is the simplest fit for the task. We provide a glimpse into the future of optical models of the human eye.

Methods: Retrospective, observational study (between October 2012 and September 2014) was performed. Patients with TAO undergoing orbital decompression for stable proptosis received ophthalmic examinations, including Hertel exophthalmometry, A-scan biometry, autorefraction measures, corneal topography, and wavefront aberration measures, before orbital decompression and again 2 months after surgery. Results: Included in the study were 43 eyes from 23 patients. The mean exophthalmometric value decreased by 4.1 mm 2 months after orbital decompression (P<0.001). On average, axial length (AL) increased significantly by 0.08 mm (P<0.001); specifically, 37 (86%) of the 43 eyes had increased AL. Whereas anterior chamber depth and lens thickness showed no significant changes (P=0.086 and P=0.905, respectively), the mean spherical refraction and spherical equivalent (SE) decreased by 0.35 and 0.48 D, respectively (P=0.008 and P<0.001, respectively). However, cylindrical refraction and axis showed no significant changes (P=0.057 and P=0.218, respectively). The changes in AL and SE were significantly correlated (R=-0.411, P=0.009). Notably, there were no changes in corneal topography or wavefront aberration after orbital decompression.

The present investigation was performed to ae the significance of prenatal Doppler findings relative to postnatal anthropometrics and body composition in IUGR newborns over the first 12 months of life. Patients and Methods Consecutive cases of singleton pregnancies with suspected IUGR were prospectively enrolled over 12 months. Fetal biometry and prenatal Doppler ultrasound examinations were performed. Body composition was aeed by absorptiometry at ages 10 days, and at 4 and12 months. Results A total of 48 pregnancies qualifying as IUGR were studied. Doppler parameters were normal in 26 pregnancies. The remaining 22 deviated from normal, marked by an Umbilical Artery Pulsatility Index (UA-PI) >95th centil or Cerebro-placental ratio (CPR) <5th centile. No significant differences emerged when comparing anthropometry and body composition at each time point, in relation to Doppler findings. Specifically, those IUGR newborns with and without abnormal Doppler findings had similar weight, length, body ma index, lean and fat ma, and bone mineral content throughout the first 12 months of life. In a separate analysis, when comparing IUGR newborns by Doppler (abnormal UA-PI vs. abnormal CPR), anthropometry and body composition did not differ significantly. Conclusions Infants with IUGR maintain a pattern of body composition during the first year of life that is independent of prenatal Doppler findings. Future studies with larger sample sizes and correlating with hormonal status are warranted to further extend the phenotypic characterization of the various conditions now claified under the common label of IUGR. © 2016 Mazarico et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"abdominal fat; absorptiometry; anthropometric parameters; anthropometry; Article; body composition; body height; body mass; bone mineral; cerebroplacental ratio; controlled study; Doppler flowmetry; fat mass; female; fetal Doppler; fetus; fetus weight; gestational age; human; infant; intrauterine growth retardation; lean body weight; major clinical study; male; newborn; prospective study; anthropometry; biometry; diagnostic imaging; Doppler ultrasonography; Fetal Growth Retardation; fetus echography; longitudinal study; phenotype; pregnancy; sex difference; Anthropometry; Biometry; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Phenotype; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Sex Factors; Ultrasonography, Doppler; Ultrasonography, Prenatal"

Methods: We report a consecutive interventional case series of seven eyes of four patients affected by UES. On presentation in our clinic, all patients showed signs of steroid effects as a consequence of a presumptive diagnosis; one eye had undergone vitrectomy for retinal detachment (RD), without benefit. Diagnosis of UES was based on ophthalmic examination, ultrasonography, fluorescein angiography, biometry and magnetic resonance imaging. Five eyes with active disease were treated using scleral thinning surgical procedures based on the extent and characteristics of the disease: sclerectomy sites were ultrasound-guided to the area of maximal choroidal swelling, associated with evacuative puncture in the case of bilateral funnel-shaped RD. Results: One patient was diagnosed with type 1 UES, two with type 2, and one with type 3. Mean postoperative follow-up was 26 months. In all eyes, surgery resolved the ciliochoroidal and retinal detachment and improved visual acuity. In two eyes, visual restoration was limited by a prolonged disease course. Conclusion: UES may be mistaken for other sources of ciliochoroidal effusion. Early diagnosis and treatment is critical to avoid unnecessary procedures and to prevent severe visual loss as a result of neuroretinal damage. Surgical treatment based on the extent and characteristics of the disease may be effective for the resolution of ciliochoroidal effusion, even in type 3 UES, where conventional surgery has proved unsuccessful. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Ciliochoroidal effusion; Multimodal imaging; Scleral thinning surgery; Ultrasound-guided surgery; Uveal effusion syndrome","azathioprine; methylprednisolone; mydriatic agent; prednisolone; steroid; triamcinolone acetonide; adolescent; adult; Article; biometry; blurred vision; case report; choroid detachment; clinical feature; early diagnosis; echography; eye examination; eye pain; female; fluorescence angiography; follow up; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; priority journal; retina detachment; sclerectomy; uvea disease; uveal effusion syndrome; uveitis; visual disorder; vitrectomy; Vogt Koyanagi syndrome; chronic disease; differential diagnosis; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; pathophysiology; phacoemulsification; physiology; sclerostomy; Uveal Diseases; Uveitis, Posterior; visual acuity; Adolescent; Adult; Biometry; Chronic Disease; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Phacoemulsification; Sclerostomy; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Uveal Diseases; Uveitis, Posterior; Visual Acuity"

The experimental results showed that the proposed approach achieved a promising accuracy result (approximately 99.5%) which is better than existed proposed solutions. Moreover, to evaluate the results of the proposed approach, four different assessment methods (Area Under Curve (AUC), Sensitivity and Specificity, accuracy rate, and Equal Error Rate (EER)) were used.

In this paper, a multitask learning approach is proposed, in which feature extraction and classifier design are carried out simultaneously. Weights are assigned to the features within the kernel of each task. We decompose the matrix consisting of all the feature weights into sparse and low-rank components. The sparse component determines the features that are relevant to identify each individual, and the low-rank component determines the common feature subspace that is relevant to identify all the subjects. A fast optimization algorithm is developed, which requires only the first-order information. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments using the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm database. © 2015 IEEE.","Biometrics; classification; electrocardiogram (ECG); feature selection; multitask learning (MTL); sparsity","Algorithms; Biomedical signal processing; Biometrics; Electrocardiography; Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Medicine; Optimization; Biometric recognition; Biometric recognition system; Fast optimizations; Multitask learning; Normal sinus rhythm; Physiological trait; Sparse and low ranks; sparsity; Classification (of information); classifier; data base; decomposition; electrocardiogram; extraction; human; joint; learning; sinus rhythm; adult; algorithm; biometry; electrocardiography; female; male; middle aged; procedures; signal processing; Adult; Algorithms; Biometric Identification; Electrocardiography; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"

The data available on the accuracy of sonographic estimation of fetal weight in triplets are very limited. In the present study we investigated the accuracy of sonographic fetal weight estimation and discordancy in triplet gestations. Methods: We analyzed the sonographic data of 33 sets of triplets born at one medical center between January 2001 and March 2013. Estimated fetal weight was calculated from biometric measurements and compared with actual neonatal weights following delivery. The Pearson correlation coefficient, linear regression analyses, and Bland-Altman method were used for statistical comparisons. Results: The differences between predicted and actual birth weights (ABW) were &lt;10% in 69 newborns (70%), 10%-20% in 19 newborns (19%), and more than 20% in 11 newborns (11%).

In many real-world scenarios especially some unconstrained environments, human faces might be occluded by other objects, and it is difficult to obtain fully holistic face images for recognition. To address this, we propose a new partial face recognition approach to recognize persons of interest from their partial faces. Given a pair of gallery image and probe face patch, we first detect keypoints and extract their local textural features. Then, we propose a robust point set matching method to discriminatively match these two extracted local feature sets, where both the textural information and geometrical information of local features are explicitly used for matching simultaneously. Finally, the similarity of two faces is converted as the distance between these two aligned feature sets. Experimental results on four public face data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","biometrics; Face recognition; feature alignment; feature set matching; image matching; partial face recognition","Biometrics; Computer vision; Geometry; Image matching; Image processing; Face recognition methods; Feature alignment; Feature sets; Geometrical informations; Local textural features; Person identification; Persons of interests; Unconstrained environments; Face recognition; anatomy and histology; biometry; diagnostic imaging; face; factual database; female; human; image processing; male; procedures; Biometric Identification; Databases, Factual; Face; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male"

Setting Private practice, Saint Joseph, Michigan, USA. Design Retrospective consecutive case series. Methods Eyes were measured with 2 biometers before cataract surgery. Six formulas were ranked by machine. Formulas were also ranked for extremely long and short eyes by averaging the ranks of 6 statistics (mean error, mean absolute error, standard deviation [SD], maximum error, and percentage of eyes within ±0.5 diopter [D] and ±1.0 D of prediction). Results Formulas were ranked by the SD of the prediction errors. The OLCR device outperformed the PCI device using the preinstalled formulas. The Olsen formula performed the best (0.378) but was preinstalled on the OLCR device only. Other formulas had the following SDs (OLCR device first, PCI device second): Haigis (0.393, 0.401), Holladay 1 (0.408, 0.414), Hoffer Q (0.428, 0.432), SRK/T (0.433, 0.440), and SRK II (0.623, 0.633).

Design: The design is a retrospective study. Participants: Four thousand nine hundred thirty-one eyes of 3524 consecutive patients undergoing cataract surgery in Auckland Public Hospital over 18months were included in the study. Methods: Analysis of preoperative medical records was performed. Main Outcome Measures: Age, gender, self-reported ethnicity, keratometry, anterior chamber depth, axial length and intraocular lens (IOL) power data were collected. Results: Māori (4.7%) were under-represented compared with the proportion of Māori attending the eye clinic (5.5%) and in the major patient catchment area (8.2%). People of Māori, Pacific and Indian ethnicities presented at a significantly younger age (66.4, 65.9 and 67.9years, respectively) than those of Caucasian and Asian ethnicities (76.4 and 71.3years, respectively, P<0.001). Advanced cataract was more likely in Pacific peoples and Māori than Caucasians. The mean axial length was longest in Asian eyes (23.83±1.52mm). The mean anterior chamber depth in the eyes of Pacific peoples (3.20±0.39mm) was significantly greater than that of Caucasians (3.09±0.42mm, P=0.001) and Asians (3.05±0.49mm, P<0.001). The mean IOL power in Asian eyes was 19.45D. This was significantly lower than the IOL power required by Caucasian (20.72D, P<0.001) and Pacific ethnicities (20.61D, P=0.001). With-the-rule astigmatism was highly prevalent in Māori and Pacific peoples, whereas in all other ethnicities, against-the-rule astigmatism was more common. Conclusions: This study identified significant ethnic variation in presentation for cataract surgery and ocular biometric parameters. These data may help identify potential biometric refinements and those at risk of developing ocular morbidities known to be associated with these parameters. © 2016 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists.","Axial length; Biometry; Cataract; Ethnic origin","adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; anterior eye chamber depth; Article; Asian; astigmatism; biometry; cataract extraction; Caucasian; child; controlled study; demography; ethnic difference; ethnicity; eye axis length; female; human; Indian; keratometry; lens power; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); medical record; New Zealand; preoperative evaluation; prevalence; public hospital; residential care; retrospective study; school child; self report; sex difference; very elderly; anatomy and histology; anterior eye chamber; biometry; cataract; cataract extraction; corneal pachymetry; epidemiology; ethnic group; ethnology; eye refraction; middle aged; statistics and numerical data; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anterior Chamber; Axial Length, Eye; Biometry; Cataract; Cataract Extraction; Child; Corneal Pachymetry; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Refraction, Ocular; Retrospective Studies"

Given that 155 million adults are in the US workforce, and >60% have employee-based insurance, workplace studies provide an important opportunity to assess and potentially advance CVH through the use of comprehensive workplace wellness programs. Among a cohort of employees of the Baptist Health System, CVH was assessed annually during voluntary health fairs and health risk assessments (HRA) from 2011 to 2014 using the AHA's 7 CVH metrics: smoking, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, diet, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and blood glucose. Each metric was categorized as ideal, intermediate, or poor according to the AHA criteria. Cochrane-Armitage test was used to detect trends in CVH by year. Ideal CVH, defined as meeting ideal criteria for all 7 metrics, was assessed and compared across years. The overall cohort was 34,746 with 4,895 employees in 2011, 10,724 in 2012, 9,763 in 2013, and 9,364 in 2014. Mean age (SD) was between 43 (±12) and 46 years (±12). Female to male ratio was 3:1. The prevalence of study participants who met the ideal criteria for diet, physical activity, and blood pressure increased significantly from 2011 to 2014 but for BMI, total cholesterol, and blood glucose, a significant decrease was noticed. In addition, the prevalence of study participants in ideal CVH although low, increased significantly over time (0.3% to 0.6%, p <0.0001). In conclusion, this study shows the trends of the AHA's CVH metrics in a large health care organization. The positive findings noted for the metrics of smoking, physical activity, total cholesterol, and blood glucose should be reinforced. However, the metrics of diet, BMI, and blood pressure need more attention. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In a real-world application scenario, a watch-list (gallery set) of a handful of known target people are provided with very few (in many cases only a single) image(s) (shots) per target. Existing re-id methods are largely unsuitable to address this open-world re-id challenge because they are designed for (1) a closed-world scenario where the gallery and probe sets are assumed to contain exactly the same people, (2) person-wise identification whereby the model attempts to verify exhaustively against each individual in the gallery set, and (3) learning a matching model using multi-shots. In this paper, a novel transfer local relative distance comparison (t-LRDC) model is formulated to address the open-world person re-identification problem by one-shot group-based verification. The model is designed to mine and transfer useful information from a labelled open-world non-target dataset.

Throughout its history, epidemiology has drawn upon statistical ideas and methods to achieve its aims. Because of the exponential growth in our capacity to measure and analyze data on the underlying processes that define each person's state of health, there is an emerging opportunity for population-based epidemiologic studies to influence health decisions made by individuals in ways that take into account the individuals' characteristics, circumstances, and preferences. We refer to this endeavor as ""individualized health."" The present article comprises 2 sections. In the first, we describe how graphical, longitudinal, and hierarchical models can inform the project of individualized health. We propose a simple graphical model for informing individual health decisions using population-based data. In the second, we review selected topics in causal inference that we believe to be particularly useful for individualized health. Epidemiology and biostatistics were 2 of the 4 founding departments in the world's first graduate school of public health at Johns Hopkins University, the centennial of which we honor.

Barriers to optimal physical activity and diet have a significant role in this risk accumulation. Methods: We developed a physical activity and nutrition intervention with immigrant and refugee families through a community-based participatory research approach. Work groups of community members and health scientists developed an intervention manual with 12 content modules that were based on social-learning theory. Family health promoters from the participating communities (Hispanic, Somali, Sudanese) were trained to deliver the intervention through 12 home visits during the first 6 months and up to 12 phone calls during the second 6 months. The intervention was tested through a randomized community-based trial with a delayed-intervention control group, with measurements at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months. Primary measurements included accelerometer-based assessment of physical activity and 24-hour dietary recall. Secondary measures included biometrics and theory-based instruments. Results: One hundred fifty-one individuals (81 adolescents, 70 adults; 44 families) were randomized. At baseline, mean (SD) time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was 64.7 (30.2) minutes/day for adolescents and 43.1 (35.4) minutes/day for adults. Moderate dietary quality was observed in both age groups. Biometric measures showed that 45.7% of adolescents and 80.0% of adults were overweight or obese. Moderate levels of self-efficacy and social support were reported for physical activity and nutrition. Discussion: Processes and products from this program are relevant to other communities aiming to reduce cardiovascular risk and negative health behaviors among immigrants and refugees.

However, estimates of radionuclide exposure and consequent tissue-specific doses, particularly for early workers for whom monitoring was relatively crude but exposures tended to be highest, can be uncertain, limiting the accuracy of risk estimates. We review the use of job-exposure matrices (JEMs) in peer-reviewed epidemiological and exposure assessment studies of nuclear industry workers exposed to radioactive materials as a method for addressing gaps in exposure data, and discuss methodology and comparability between studies. We identified nine studies of nuclear worker cohorts in France, Russia, the USA and the UK that had incorporated JEMs in their exposure assessments. All these JEMs were study or cohort-specific, and although broadly comparable methodologies were used in their construction, this is insufficient to enable the transfer of any one JEM to another study. Moreover there was often inadequate detail on whether, or how, JEMs were validated. JEMs have become more detailed and more quantitative, and this trend may eventually enable better comparison across, and the pooling of, studies. We conclude that JEMs have been shown to be a valuable exposure assessment methodology for imputation of missing exposure data for nuclear worker cohorts with data not missing at random. The next step forward for direct comparison or pooled analysis of complete cohorts would be the use of transparent and transferable methods.",,"plutonium; adverse effects; analysis; biometry; France; human; occupational exposure; procedures; Russian Federation; United Kingdom; United States; Biometry; France; Humans; Occupational Exposure; Plutonium; Russia; United Kingdom; United States"

However, it is common to find data that exhibit overdispersion. In practice, the assumption of equidispersion may be violated due to unobserved heterogeneity in the cell population, which will render the variance of observed aberration counts larger than their mean, and/or the frequency of zero counts greater than expected for the Poisson distribution. This phenomenon is observable for both full- and partial-body exposure, but more pronounced for the latter. In this work, different methodologies for analyzing cytogenetic chromosomal aberrations datasets are compared, with special focus on zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models. A score test for testing for zero inflation in Poisson regression models under the identity link is also developed. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We present observations of novel spiral and rotor patterns produced by fairy ring fungi and explain these behaviors mathematically by first showing that a well known model of fairy ring fungal growth and the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model are mathematically equivalent. We then use bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations to identify the conditions under which spiral waves and rotors can arise. We demonstrate that the region of dimensionless parameter space supporting these more complex dynamics is adjacent to that which produces the more familiar fairy rings, and identify experimental manipulations to test the transitions between these spatial modes. These same manipulations could also feasibly induce fungal colonies to transition from rotor/spiral formation to a set of richer, as yet unobserved, spatial patterns. © 2016 Karst et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"behavior; computer simulation; diffusion; fungus growth; Basidiomycetes; biological model; biomass; biometry; microbiology; physiology; Basidiomycota; Biomass; Biometry; Computer Simulation; Models, Biological; Soil Microbiology"

Methods: A database of 82 papers that described female subject groups containing information on preexperimental maximal cycle-protocol designs, terminology, biometrical and physiological parameters, and cycling experience was analyzed. Subject groups were divided into performance levels (PLs), according to the nomenclature. Body mass, body-mass index, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), peak power output (PPO), and training status were compared between PLs and between female and male PLs. Results: Five female PLs were defined, representing untrained, active, trained, well-trained, and professional female subjects. VO2max and PPO significantly increased with PL, except for PL3 and PL4 (P &lt; .01). For each PL, significant differences were observed in absolute and relative VO2max and PPO between male and female subject groups. Relative VO2max is the most cited parameter for female subject groups and is proposed as the principal parameter to classify the groups. Conclusion: This systematic review shows the large variety in the description of female subject groups in the existing literature. The authors propose a standardized preexperimental testing protocol and guidelines to classify female subject groups into 5 PLs based on relative VO2max, relative PPO, training status, absolute VO2max, and absolute PPO. © 2016 Human Kinetics, Inc.","Classification; Female cycling; Performance parameters","aerobic capacity; body mass; classification; data base; exercise; female; human; male; nomenclature; participant observation; practice guideline; sport; systematic review; athletic performance; biometry; classification; comparative study; cycling; exercise test; methodology; normal human; oxygen consumption; physiology; procedures; standards; Athletic Performance; Bicycling; Biometry; Exercise Test; Female; Guidelines as Topic; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Research Design"

Careful checks of the submitted code as part of the reviewing process are essential to eliminate these issues and to foster RR. In this article, we reviewed recent submissions of code and data to identify common reproducibility issues. Based on these findings, guidelines for structuring code submission to the Biometrical Journal have been established to help authors. These guidelines should help researchers to implement RR in general.

This study aims to compute facial biometrics of Yorubas of Osun State of Nigeria using a novel Akinlolu-Raji image‑processing algorithm. Materials and Methods: Three hundred Yorubas of Osun State (150 males and 150 females, aged 15–33 years) were selected as subjects for the study with informed consents and when established as Yorubas by parents and grandparents. Height, body weight, and facial biometrics (evaluated on three-dimensional [3D] facial photographs) were measured on all subjects. The novel Akinlolu‑Raji image‑processing algorithm for forensic face recognition was developed using the modified row method of computer programming. Facial width, total face height, short forehead height, long forehead height, upper face height, nasal bridge length, nose height, morphological face height, and lower face height computed from readings of the Akinlolu‑Raji image‑processing algorithm were analyzed using z-test (P ≤ 0.05) of 2010 Microsoft Excel statistical software. Results: Statistical analyzes of facial measurements showed nonsignificant higher mean values (P > 0.05) in Yoruba males compared to females. Yoruba males and females have the leptoprosopic face type based on classifications of face types from facial indices. Conclusions: Akinlolu‑Raji image-processing algorithm can be employed for computing anthropometric, forensic, diagnostic, or any other measurements on 2D and 3D images, and data computed from its readings can be converted to actual or life sizes as obtained in 1D measurements.

According to the theory of a polycentric origin for domestication, mainly supported by the presence of the wild form all over the Mediterranean area, the goal of this study is to use endocarps biometric features, measured by image analysis techniques, in order to investigate the relationships among different Sardinian wild olive populations, ancient olive trees and olive cultivars. A total of 137 morphometric, colorimetric and textural characters were measured on each of the 2842 studied endocarps. The morpho-colorimetric analysis of olive endocarps proved the effectiveness of the technique to discriminate between the two currently recognized O. europaea L. varieties (var. europaea and var. sylvestris). The partial overlapping that resulted between wild and ancient olives suggests the existence of large populations characterized by a high degree of phenotypic variability. Similar results were reached for varietal discrimination, perfectly fitting with previous findings of molecular studies. Considering the phenotypic and genetic distance of cultivars from autochthonous wild olives, the allochthonous origin of local varieties is furthermore confirmed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Image analysis; Landraces; Morpho-colorimetric characterization; Olea europaea L.; Sardinia; Wild crop relatives","Color; Colorimetric analysis; Colorimetry; Computer vision; Cultivation; Forestry; Value engineering; Colorimetric characterization; Landraces; Olea europaea L; Sardinia; Wild crop relatives; Image analysis; biometry; colorimetry; computer vision; cultivar; deciduous tree; domestication; image analysis; Mediterranean environment; morphometry; phenotype; wild population; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Sardinia; Olea europaea; Olea europaea var. sylvestris; Oleaceae"

Our approach has two novel components: 1) a set of local binary features and 2) a locality principle for learning those features. The locality principle guides us to learn a set of highly discriminative local binary features for each facial landmark independently. The obtained local binary features are used to jointly learn a linear regression for the final output. This approach achieves the state-of-the-art results when tested on the most challenging benchmarks to date. Furthermore, because extracting and regressing local binary features are computationally very cheap, our system is much faster than previous methods. It achieves over 3000 frames per second (FPS) on a desktop or 300 FPS on a mobile phone for locating a few dozens of landmarks. We also study a key issue that is important but has received little attention in the previous research, which is the face detector used to initialize alignment. We investigate several face detectors and perform quantitative evaluation on how they affect alignment accuracy. We find that an alignment friendly detector can further greatly boost the accuracy of our alignment method, reducing the error up to 16% relatively. To facilitate practical usage of face detection/alignment methods, we also propose a convenient metric to measure how good a detector is for alignment initialization. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","face alignment; local binary feature; random forest; tracking","Bins; Decision trees; E-learning; Surface discharges; Alignment accuracy; Alignment methods; Binary features; Face alignment; Frames per seconds; Locality principle; Quantitative evaluation; Random forests; Face recognition; anatomy and histology; biometry; decision tree; diagnostic imaging; face; factual database; human; image processing; procedures; regression analysis; Biometric Identification; Databases, Factual; Decision Trees; Face; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Regression Analysis"

In earlier work published in Biometrics, Kim, Hudgens, Dreyfuss, Westreich, and Pilcher (2007, Biometrics 63, 1152-1162) also proposed group testing algorithms in a homogeneous population with misclassification. In both cases, the authors evaluated performance of the algorithms based on the expected number of tests per person, with the optimal design being defined by minimizing this quantity. The purpose of this article is to show that although the expected number of tests per person is an appropriate evaluation criteria for group testing when there is no misclassification, it may be problematic when there is misclassification. Specifically, a valid criterion needs to take into account the amount of correct classification and not just the number of tests. We propose, a more suitable objective function that accounts for not only the expected number of tests, but also the expected number of correct classifications. We then show how using this objective function that accounts for correct classification is important for design when considering group testing under misclassification.

This study was conducted to determine factors that influence tree species configurations and how tree characteristics affect canopy cover in cocoa farms. Eighty-six farmers and corresponding farms were selected in a systematic approach in four districts across two agro-ecological zones in Ghana. Results show that men tend to have larger farm sizes, higher tree density and diversity than women. Tree density and canopy cover of shade trees were low on large farms, but diversity increased with increasing farm sizes. Even though there was a significant correlation between diameter at breast height and crown area for all species investigated, tree species differed considerably in their crown area and thus the amount of ground cover provided. Current recommendations for shade are usually expressed in number of trees per ha, and our results suggest that these should be refined to reflect the effects of species, the size of their diameter at breast height and the crown area. © 2015, The Author(s).","Canopy cover; Cocoa agroforest; Structural diversity; Tree diversity","Cocoa; Agro-ecological zones; Canopy cover; Diameter-at-breast heights; Number of trees; Structural diversity; Theobroma cacao; Tree characteristics; Tree diversity; Forestry; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; agroforestry; biometry; canopy architecture; cocoa; farm size; species diversity; vegetation cover; Ghana; Theobroma cacao"

Methods: One-hundred seventeen eyes (29 PACS, 30 PAC, 28 PACG, and 30 POAG) of 117 patients were included in this cross-sectional study. The subjects underwent hourly IOP measurements with Goldmann tonometer from 0800 to 1700 hours. Subjects with PAC and PACG had laser peripheral iridotomy at least 2 weeks prior to the inclusion. SD of office-hour IOP readings was the main outcome measure. Results: IOP fluctuation differed between the groups (P=0.01; Kruskal-Wallis Test). Post hoc Mann-Whitney U-tests showed significantly less IOP fluctuation in PACS compared with PACG (P<0.01). Peak office-hour IOP was observed in the morning in untreated subjects and in the early afternoon in treated subjects. A stepwise linear regression model identified the presence of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), thickness of lens, large vertical cup-to-disc ratio (VCDR), and PAC category as significant predictive factors associated with office-hour IOP fluctuation. Conclusions: Diurnal IOP fluctuation in asymptomatic PACSs was less than that in treated PACG subjects and was at least comparable to that in treated PAC and POAG subjects. The greater the amount of PAS, the thicker the lens, the larger the VCDR, the greater was the IOP fluctuation during office hours. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",,"antiglaucoma agent; adult; anterior eye chamber depth; Article; closed angle glaucoma; controlled study; cornea thickness; cross-sectional study; disease severity; diurnal intraocular pressure fluctuation; female; gonioscopy; human; humphrey visual filed; intraocular pressure; iridotomy; laser peripheral iridotomy; lens thickness; major clinical study; male; middle aged; open angle glaucoma; optic disk; primary angle closure glaucoma; risk factor; trabecular meshwork; visual system parameters; aged; biometry; circadian rhythm; corneal pachymetry; Glaucoma, Angle-Closure; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; intraocular pressure; iridectomy; iris; laser coagulation; oculoplethysmography; pathophysiology; physiology; Aged; Biometry; Circadian Rhythm; Corneal Pachymetry; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Glaucoma, Angle-Closure; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Gonioscopy; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Iridectomy; Iris; Laser Coagulation; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Tonometry, Ocular"

Methods: Two samples of fetuses aged 14-40 weeks were selected from our institution's ultrasonographic database. Regression analysis was used to construct reference charts of femoral and humeral lengths based on the local population (n=901). Femur and humerus length measurements from a second sample (n=1240) were transformed into Z-scores using local and previously published equations. Z-score distributions were used to assess the appropriateness of reference curves for our population. Fetuses aged 18-24 weeks with measurements &lt;5th percentile were identified using each reference equation. Results: For femoral length, one equation other than the local equation yielded Z-score values within the standard normal distribution (P=0.10), but the histogram was skewed to the right. All Z-score distributions for humeral length fell within the normal distribution (P&gt;0.05), but one was skewed to the right. The numbers of fetuses with femoral and humeral lengths &lt;5th percentile in second-trimester ultrasound examinations varied widely among reference equations used. Conclusion: Most reference charts assessed underestimated the number of fetuses with long bone lengths &lt;5th percentile in second-trimester ultrasound examinations and were thus unfit for interpretations of biometric data from the study population. © 2016 by De Gruyter.","Reference charts; short femur; short humerus; ultrasound","Article; biometry; bone length; femur; fetus; fetus echography; gestational age; human; humerus; major clinical study; priority journal; reference value; retrospective study; second trimester pregnancy; adult; diagnostic imaging; evaluation study; female; pregnancy; reference value; regression analysis; Adult; Biometry; Female; Femur; Fetus; Gestational Age; Humans; Humerus; Pregnancy; Reference Values; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Ultrasonography, Prenatal"

When using passive markers for the optical motion tracking, avoiding identity confusion between the markers becomes a problem as the speed of motion increases, necessitating a higher frame rate to avoid a failure of the motion tracking caused by marker confusions and/or dropouts. Initially, one might believe that the Nyquist-Shannon sampling rate estimated from the assumed maximal temporal variation of a motion (i.e. a sampling rate at least twice that of the maximum motion frequency) could be the complete solution to the problem. However, this paper shows that also the spatial distance between the markers should be taken into account in determining the suitable frame rate of an optical motion tracking with passive markers. In this paper, a frame rate criterion for the optical tracking using passive markers is theoretically derived and also experimentally verified using a high-quality optical motion tracking system. Both the theoretical and the experimental results showed that the minimum frame rate is proportional to the ratio between the maximum speed of the motion and the minimum spacing between markers, and may also be predicted precisely if the proportional constant is known in advance. The inverse of the proportional constant is here defined as the tracking efficiency constant and it can be easily determined with some test measurements. Moreover, this newly defined constant can provide a new way of evaluating the tracking algorithm performance of an optical tracking system. © 2016 Song, Godøy.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"body movement; experimental model; eye tracking; identity; motion; sampling; theoretical model; velocity; algorithm; biometry; devices; human; image enhancement; procedures; time factor; Algorithms; Biometry; Humans; Image Enhancement; Motion; Time Factors"

Specifically, the MDML-DCPs scheme exploits the first derivative of Gaussian operator to reduce the impact of differences in illumination and then computes the DCP feature at both the holistic and component levels. DCP is a novel face image descriptor inspired by the unique textural structure of human faces. It is computationally efficient and only doubles the cost of computing local binary patterns, yet is extremely robust to pose and expression variations. MDML-DCPs comprehensively yet efficiently encodes the invariant characteristics of a face image from multiple levels into patterns that are highly discriminative of inter-personal differences but robust to intra-personal variations. Experimental results on the FERET, CAS-PERL-R1, FRGC 2.0, and LFW databases indicate that DCP outperforms the state-of-the-art local descriptors (e.g., LBP, LTP, LPQ, POEM, tLBP, and LGXP) for both face identification and face verification tasks. More impressively, the best performance is achieved on the challenging LFW and FRGC 2.0 databases by deploying MDML-DCPs in a simple recognition scheme. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","face image descriptors; face image representation; Face recognition","Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Computationally efficient; Expression variations; Face identification; Face images; Face Verification; Intra-personal variations; Local binary patterns; Local descriptors; Face recognition; algorithm; anatomy and histology; biometry; diagnostic imaging; face; human; image processing; principal component analysis; procedures; Algorithms; Biometric Identification; Face; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Principal Component Analysis"

In compound eyes, interommatidial angles are a key determinant of visual acuity but methods for measuring these angles are often demanding and limited to live animals with a pseudopupil. Here we present a new technique for measuring interommatidial angles that is less demanding in terms of technology than other techniques but still accurate. It allows measurements in eyes without a pseudopupil such as dark eyes or even museum specimens. We call this technique the radius of curvature estimation (RCE) method. We describe RCE and validate the method by comparing results from RCE with those from pseudopupil analysis for the butterfly Asterocampa leilia. As an application of RCE we measure the eyes of the butterfly Battus philenor, a species whose visually guided behaviour is well known but whose eye structure and visual acuity are unknown. We discuss the results of the eye morphology in B. philenor in relation to their behaviour and ecology. We contend that RCE fills a gap in the repertoire of techniques available to study peripheral determinants of spatial resolution in compound eyes, because it can be applied on species with dark eyes. RCE then opens up for sampling a larger number of specimens, which, in combination with being able to use museum specimens, makes it possible to quantitatively test ecologically and evolutionarily driven hypotheses about vision in animals in a new way. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London.","Butterfly vision; Eye morphology; Lepidoptera; Spatial resolution; Vision; Visual acuity","behavioral ecology; biometry; butterfly; eye; morphology; museum; spatial resolution; vision; visual analysis; Animalia; Aristolochia tomentosa; Asterocampa leilia; Battus philenor; Lepidoptera"

I undertook this examination. Methods Data from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used (N = 2048 adults 20 years old and older). Physical activity was assessed via accelerometry, with multimorbidity assessed via physician diagnosis and biometric screening. Results In a multivariable linear regression and after adjustments, for every 60-minute/day increase in LIPA, participants had a lower multimorbidity index (βadjusted = -0.09, 95% confidence interval -0.12 to -0.05, P &lt; 0.001). In a multivariable logistic regression and after adjustments, for every 60-minute/day increase in LIPA, participants had 13% (odds ratioadjusted 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.79-0.96, P = 0.01) reduced odds of being multimorbid (ie, having ≥2 morbidities). Conclusions LIPA, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, is associated with reduced odds of multimorbidity. As such, promotion of LIPA, as well as moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, may be a sensible strategy to help prevent and treat multimorbidity. © 2016 by The Southern Medical Association.","chronic disease; epidemiology; health; physical activity","cholesterol; cotinine; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; accelerometry; adult; Article; biometry; blood pressure; body fat; chronic disease; clinical assessment; controlled study; exercise intensity; female; health survey; human; hypertension; light intensity physical activity; major clinical study; male; medical multimorbidity; moderate to vigorous physical activity; morbidity; multimorbidity index; multiple linear regression analysis; obesity; physical activity; physical parameters; physician; poverty; sex difference; smoking; socioeconomics; United States; young adult; comorbidity; motor activity; statistical model; Adult; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Motor Activity; United States"

In 2015, Lu et al. used Li et al.’s scheme as a basis to propose a password authentication scheme for TMISs that is based on biometrics and smart card technology and employs extended chaotic maps. Lu et al. demonstrated that Li et al.’s scheme comprises some weaknesses such as those regarding a violation of the session-key security, a vulnerability to the user impersonation attack, and a lack of local verification. In this paper, however, we show that Lu et al.’s scheme is still insecure with respect to issues such as a violation of the session-key security, and that it is vulnerable to both the outsider attack and the impersonation attack.

We hypothesized that this disjunct occurrence (the Peloponnese in Europe and the Taurus and Lebanon Mountains in Asia) should be reflected in the patterns of genetic and morphological diversity and differentiation. Nuclear microsatellite markers (nSSR) and biometric variables of the cones and seeds were examined on material sampled from four populations in Europe and eight in Asia. The Asian populations were characterized by a higher level of genetic diversity than the European populations. The genetic differentiation among populations was moderate but significant (FST = 0.101, P &lt; 0.001). According to the clustering performed with BAPS, six genetically and geographically groups of populations were found: I and II from the Peloponnese; III from the Taurus Mountains; IV and V from the Anti-Taurus Mountains; and VI from the Lebanon Mountains. The level of genetic differentiation among these six groups (4.30%, P = 0.012) probably reflects long-lasting genetic isolation during the Pleistocene, as limited genetic admixture was found. In accordance with genetic analysis, the biometric investigations indicated a high level of morphological divergence between the European and Asian populations of the species, with further differentiation between the populations from the Taurus and Lebanon Mountains. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London.","Bayesian clustering; Biogeography; Biometrics; East Mediterranean; Multivariate analyses; NSSR; Plant diversity; Plant variation; STRUCTURE clustering","Bayesian analysis; biogeography; biometry; cluster analysis; coniferous tree; divergence; genetic analysis; genetic differentiation; genetic isolation; genetic marker; genetic variation; Mediterranean environment; mountain environment; multivariate analysis; plant community; Pleistocene; Aegean Sea; Asia; Europe; Greece; Mediterranean Sea; Peloponnese; Taurides; Turkey; Cupressaceae; Juniperus drupacea"

Eleven laboratories participated in a DNA matching exercise to identify victims from a hypothetical conflict with 193 missing persons. The post mortem database was comprised of 87 skeletal remain profiles from a secondary mass grave displaying a minimal number of 58 individuals with evidence of commingling. The reference database was represented by 286 family reference profiles with diverse pedigrees. The goal of the exercise was to correctly discover re-associations and family matches. The results of direct matching for commingled remains re-associations were correct and fully concordant among all laboratories. However, the kinship analysis for missing persons identifications showed variable results among the participants. There was a group of laboratories with correct, concordant results but nearly half of the others showed discrepant results exhibiting likelihood ratio differences of several degrees of magnitude in some cases. Three main errors were detected: (a) some laboratories did not use the complete reference family genetic data to report the match with the remains, (b) the identity and/or non-identity hypotheses were sometimes wrongly expressed in the likelihood ratio calculations, and (c) many laboratories did not properly evaluate the prior odds for the event. The results suggest that large-scale profile comparisons for DVI or MPI is a challenge for forensic genetics laboratories and the statistical treatment of DNA matching and the Bayesian framework should be better standardized among laboratories. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It is shown how the birds manage to make progress against the wind on the basis of small-scale dynamic soaring maneuvers. For this purpose, trajectory features, motion quantities and mechanical energy relationships as well as force characteristics are analyzed. The movement on a large-scale basis consists of a tacking type flight technique which is composed of dynamic soaring cycle sequences with alternating orientation to the left and right. It is shown how this is performed by the birds so that they can achieve a net upwind flight without a transversal large-scale movement and how this compares with downwind or across wind flight. Results on upwind dynamic soaring are presented for low and high wind speed cases. It is quantified how much the tacking trajectory length is increased when compared with the beeline distance.

A complete ophthalmologic exam was conducted, including neuro-ophthalmic reflexes, Schirmer tear test I (STT-I), intraocular pressure (IOP) using rebound tonometry, fluorescein staining, horizontal corneal measurements using Jameson calipers, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, and ocular ultrasound biometry. Eyes with an STT of <5 mm/min, outliers, and eyes with severe diseases were excluded from reference value analysis. No statistically significant differences were found between right or left eyes in either species or among individuals in different age groups and sexes. Mean intraocular pressures and Schirmer tear tests were also not statistically significantly different between great grey owls and snowy owls (IOP: 9.6 ± 2.6 mm Hg and 9.1 ± 1.9 mm Hg, respectively, and STT-I: 9.8 ± 2.8 mm/min and 9.8 ± 2.4 mm/min, respectively).

Patients and methods: A retrospective chart review of 416 eyes of 209 patients from one site that underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery with multifocal IOL implantation. Biometry, the IOL, and refractive data were recorded after the original implantation, with the same data recorded after retreatment. Comments related to vision were obtained both before and after retreatment for retreated patients. Results: The multifocal retreatment rate was 10.8% (45/416 eyes). The eyes that required retreatment had significantly higher residual refractive astigmatism compared with those who did not require retreatment (1.21±0.51 D vs 0.51±0.39 D, P<0.01). The retreatment rate for the two most commonly implanted primary IOLs, blended bifocal (10.5%, 16/152) and bilateral trifocal (6.9%, 14/202) IOLs, was not statistically significantly different (P=0.12). In those requiring retreatment, refractive-related complaints were most common. Retreatment with refractive corneal surgery, in 11% of the eyes, and piggyback IOLs, in 89% of the eyes, was similarly successful, improving patient complaints 78% of the time. Conclusion: Complaints related to ametropia were the main reasons for retreatment. Residual astigmatism appears to be an important determinant of retreatment rate after multifocal IOL implantation. Retreatment can improve symptoms for a high percentage of patients; a piggyback IOL is a viable retreatment option. © 2016 Gundersen et al.","Astigmatism; Piggyback IOL; STAAR; Sulcoflex; Symptoms; Toric","adult; ametropia; Article; astigmatism; cataract extraction; controlled study; cornea surgery; female; human; lens implant; lens implantation; major clinical study; male; medical record review; multifocal intraocular lens; refraction error; retreatment; treatment outcome"

There are more than 200 million residents living in the country. As a developing country, Indonesia has several health problems. First, Indonesia has a high value of mortality caused by heart and cardio vascular diseases. One of the major cause is the lack of medical checkup especially for heart monitoring. It is caused by limited number of medical instrumentation e.g. ECG in hospital and public health center. The supporting factor is the small number of cardiologist in Indonesia. There are 365 cardiologists across the country, which is a very small number compared to the 200 million of Indonesia population. Furthermore, they are not distributed evenly in all provinces, but only centered in Jakarta and other capital cities. Therefore, it is difficult for residents to get appropriate heart monitoring. Second, the mortality rate of mother and baby during delivery of the baby in Indonesia is also high. One way to solve this problem is to devise a system where the health clinics in rural areas can perform fetal biometry detection before consulting the results to the expert physicians from other areas. The proposed system will be equipped with algorithms for automatic fetal detection and biometry measurement. By the end of this development, we have several results, the first is a classifier to automatic heartbeat disease prediction with accuracy more than 95%, the second is compression method based on wavelet decompositon, and the third is detection and approximation a fetus in an ultrasound image with hit rate more than 93%. © 2015 IEEE.","ECG; Feal Growth; Heart Disease; telehealth; USG","Developing countries; Electrocardiography; Health; Information systems; Medical computing; Patient monitoring; Ultrasonic applications; Cardio-vascular disease; Compression methods; Heart disease; Medical instrumentation; Supporting factors; Telehealth; Telehealth system; Ultrasound images; Heart"

Moreover, data acquisition at the feature level brings out rich information from the traits, thus fusion of modalities at this level is desirable. In this paper we propose a novel fusion technique called non-stationary feature fusion where a new structure of interleaved matrix is constructed using local features extracted from two modalities i.e. face and palmprint images. A block based Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) algorithm is used to construct a fused feature vector by extracting independent feature vectors from each spatial image. This fused feature vector contains nonlinear information that is used to train a Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) based statistical model. The model provides accurate estimation of the class conditional probability density function of the fused feature vector. The proposed method produces recognition rates as high as 99.7% and 97% when tested on benchmark databases-ORL-PolyU and FERET-PolyU respectively. These rates are achieved using 23% low frequency DCT coefficients. The new technique is shown to outperform existing feature level fusion methods including methods based on matching and decision level fusion. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Face recognition; Feature fusion; Information fusion; Local features; Multimodal biometrics; Palmprint recognition","Anthropometry; Biometrics; Data acquisition; Discrete cosine transforms; Image matching; Image processing; Information fusion; Palmprint recognition; Probability density function; Speech recognition; Vectors; Biometric recognition system; Block-based discrete cosine transforms; Conditional probability density; Decision level fusion; Feature fusion; Gaussian Mixture Model; Local feature; Multi-modal biometrics; Face recognition; accuracy; algorithm; Article; automated pattern recognition; biometry; data base; density functional theory; discrete cosine transform algorithm; face and palmprint multimodal biometry; Gaussian mixture model; information processing; intermethod comparison; non stationary feature fusion; priority journal; probability; statistical model"

Methods: The interventional case series enrolled 314 eyes undergoing cataract surgery in Xiamen Ophthalmic Center between April and December 2013, patients were randomized to femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (153 eyes) and conventional phacoemulsification cataract surgery (161 eyes). The clincic parameters of preoperation, during operation and postoperation were compared and statistically studied. Quantitative data were analyzed using the analysis of variance, independent t tests. Qualitative datawere analyzed using the crosstabs analysis chi-square test or the Fisher's exact test. Results: The patient's demographics parameters (age, gender, IOP, axial length, mean keratometry, AC depth, Cataract grade) did not differ significantly between groups (P&gt;0.05). The CDE showing 4.78% (3.18%-8.88%) and EPT showing 14.05 s (10.07-20.85 s)in the laser group were significantly lower than the CDE showing 8.82% (6.01%-19.16%) and EPT showing 23.65 s(18.36-46.96 s)in the conventional group (z=2.30, 2.91; P&lt;0.05). The relative diameter and circularity in laser-assisted capusulotomies were significantly more accurate (t=2.58, 3.92; P&lt;0.05). The corneal endothelial cell loss showing 73.50 (-69.51-111.03)/mm2 was significantly lower in the laser group than the loss of 118.06 (53.55-299.03)/mm2 in the conventional group 1 month postoperatively (z=2.44; P&lt;0.05). Postoperative anterial chamber flare was significantly greater in the conventional group at 1 day of 18.81 (13.32-20.23) ph/ms in laser group, 24.51 (16.38-32.18) ph/m in conventional group and at 1 month of 13.01 (9.23-16.28) ph/ms in laser group, 18.05 (12.37-24.97) ph/ms in conventional group than the laser group (z=2.40, 2.31; P&lt;0.05). There were no severe surgical complications for both groups. Conclusions: The femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery was effective and safe. It reduced EPT and CDE during operation, therefore decreased endothelial damage and postoperative anterior chamber inflammation. It also provided more precise and reproducible capsulotomies.

Researches showed that the change of tear film stability leads to shift of corneal refractive power, which probably affects the measurement of intraocular lens (IOL) power. The influence of dry eye on the calculation of IOL power is worth paying close attention. Objective: This study was to investigate the influence of dry eye on the accuracy of IOL power calculation in age-related cataractous patients. Methods: A non-randomized controlled clinical study was performed. Two hundred and sixteen eyes of 216 cataract patients were enrolled in Yanbian Eye Ear Nose and Throat Hospital from May 2013 to February 2014. The visual acuity, intraocular pressure, break up time of tear film (BUT), Schirmer I test (SIt) and corneal fluorescein staining were examined in all the eyes, and then the patients were assigned to mild dry eye group (73 eyes), severe dry eye group (68 eyes) and non-dry eye control group (75 eyes). The axial length (AL) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were measured using IOL Master for the calculation of IOL power and K value (corneal curvature). Phacoemulsification with IOL implantation was performed on all the eyes,and the refractive power was measured with KR 8100 automatic optometry 2 months after operation. The mean absolute refractive error (MARE) between actual refraction and predicted refraction was calculated, and percentage of eyes in different refractive error ranges was compared between the dry eye group and non-dry eye control group. The correlations of dry eye-related parameters with peroperative K value and refractive error were analyzed. This study was approved by the Ethics of Yanbian University, and written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to entering the cohort. Results: No significant differences were found in age, gender, AL, ACD and MARE among the mild dry eye group, severe dry eye group and non-dry eye control group (all at P&gt;0.05), and significant differences in BUT, SIt and corneal fluorescein staining scores were found among these three groups (F=5.460, 4.521, 3.572, all at P&lt;0.05). The K values were (43.59±1.39), (44.66±1.53) and (43.42±1.32)D in the mild dry eye group, severe dry eye group and non-dry eye control group, and the K value in the severe dry eye group was significantly higher than that in the non-dry eye control group (P=0.012). The percentage of eyes with +0.50-+0.75 D deviation was significantly elevated (28.8% versus 13.3%), and that with -0.50-0.75 D deviation was significantly declined (17.3% versus 28.0%) in the dry eye group compared with non-dry eye control group (χ2=4.513, P=0.032; χ2=4.236, P=0.037). A negative correlation was found between BUT and K value (r=-0.204, P=0.011). Conclusions: Dry eye affects the accuracy of the determination of IOL power. Compared with the preoperative refraction predictive value,the postoperative refraction shift toward hyperopia.

Comparisons are made with the same elements in representatives of the three remaining extant families of lipotyphlans, the soricid Crocidura luna Dollman, 1910, the talpid Parascalops breweri (Bachman, 1842), and the erinaceid Erinaceus europaeus Linnaeus, 1758. The muscles attaching to the osseous elements of the foot in lipotyphlans are summarized based on the literature. The solenodon foot is generalized but with a unique modification regarding the entocuneiform: it has an elongate medial spur with a sizeable facet for the astragalar head. The other lipotyphlans studied have a medial spur of the entocuneiform, but it is well separated from the astragalus by the navicular. Crocidura luna also has a remarkable modification; the ectal facets on the astragalus and calcaneus have opposing concavoconvex surfaces. Measurements of all osseous elements of the foot were collected in the four lipotyphlans studied here. Various indices, the vast majority of which were taken from the literature, were calculated from these measurements.

The journal does not exist anymore but the methodology found widespread interest in the scientific community over the past 25 years. The use of such multistage adaptive designs raised many controversial discussions from the beginning on, especially after the publication by Bauer and Köhne 1994 in Biometrics: Broad enthusiasm about potential applications of such designs faced critical positions regarding their statistical efficiency. Despite, or possibly because of, this controversy, the methodology and its areas of applications grew steadily over the years, with significant contributions from statisticians working in academia, industry and agencies around the world. In the meantime, such type of adaptive designs have become the subject of two major regulatory guidance documents in the US and Europe and the field is still evolving. Developments are particularly noteworthy in the most important applications of adaptive designs, including sample size reassessment, treatment selection procedures, and population enrichment designs. In this article, we summarize the developments over the past 25 years from different perspectives. We provide a historical overview of the early days, review the key methodological concepts and summarize regulatory and industry perspectives on such designs. Then, we illustrate the application of adaptive designs with three case studies, including unblinded sample size reassessment, adaptive treatment selection, and adaptive endpoint selection. We also discuss the availability of software for evaluating and performing such designs. We conclude with a critical review of how expectations from the beginning were fulfilled, and - if not - discuss potential reasons why this did not happen. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Adaptive design; Clinical trials; Group sequential designs","cannabis; clonidine; crofelemer; eniporide; fentanyl; formoterol; indacaterol; midazolam; placebo; propranolol; tiotropium bromide; Article; capillary hemangioma; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical trial (topic); computer program; confirmatory adaptive design; diarrhea; drug approval; early termination of clinical trial; effect size; fibrinolytic therapy; human; methodology; multiple sclerosis; muscle rigidity; null hypothesis; outcome assessment; patient dropouts; personalized medicine; sample size; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; statistical analysis; study design; systematic error; transluminal coronary angioplasty; bioassay; biometry; meta analysis (topic); procedures; sample size; software design; statistics and numerical data; Biometry; Clinical Trials as Topic; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Endpoint Determination; Humans; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Research Design; Sample Size; Software Design"

This study aimed to analyze the diversity and characterize the crop yield of genotypes of Coffea arabica L. with potential for cultivation in high plant density systems. In addition, it also aimed to quantify the expression of agronomic traits in this cultivation system and provide information on the genotypes with the highest cultivation potential in the studied region. The experiment followed a randomized block design with 16 genotypes, four repetitions, and six plants per experimental plot. Plant spacing was 2.00 x 0.60 m, with a total of 8333 plants per hectare, representing a high-density cultivation system. Coffee plants were cultivated until the start of their reproductive phenological cycles and were evaluated along four complete reproductive cycles. Genotypes with high crop yield and beverage quality, short canopy, and rust resistance were selected. C. arabica genotypes showed variability in almost all characteristics. It was possible to identify different responses among genotypes grown in a high plant density cultivation system. Although the chlorophyll a content was similar among genotypes, the genotypes Acauã, Araponga MG1, Sacramento MG1, Tupi, and Catuaí IAC 44 showed a higher chlorophyll b content than the other genotypes. Among these, Sacramento MG1 also showed high leafiness and growth of vegetative structures, whereas Araponga MG1, Pau-Brasil MG1, and Tupi showed high fruit production.

PFM morphology can be inferred from the biometry of the levator hiatus determined through dynamic ultrasound imaging. Aims: The aim of this study was to determine the nature of PFM involvement in women with PVD via an evaluation of the biometry of the levator hiatus at rest, upon maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the PFMs, and upon maximal Valsalva maneuver (MVM). Methods: Thirty-eight women with PVD and 39 asymptomatic controls were imaged using 3D transperineal ultrasound. Levator hiatal dimensions (area; left-right [LR] and anteroposterior [AP] diameters) were measured at rest, on MVC, and on MVM. Differences in hiatal dimensions and in relative changes in dimensions from rest to MVC and from rest to MVM were compared between groups using separate 1-way analyses of variance for each measure and task. Analysis of covariance models were used to investigate the impact of levator hiatal dimensions at rest on the relative changes in the levator hiatal dimensions during MVC and MVM. Main Outcome Measures: Levator hiatal area, LR, and AP diameters, at rest, on MVC, and on MVM were the main outcome measures. Relative changes in hiatal dimensions were assessed as the percent change in hiatal area, LR diameter, and AP diameter. Results: In comparison with controls, women with PVD had smaller hiatal areas at rest, on MVC, and on MVM, concurrent with smaller LR diameters on MVM. Women with PVD had a significantly smaller change in hiatal area on MVM than controls, but no differences were evident on MVC. In both groups, smaller levator hiatal dimensions at rest were associated with smaller relative decreases in dimensions on MVC and larger relative increases in dimensions on MVM. Conclusion: In comparison to controls, women with PVD appear to have narrower levator hiatus' and less capacity to distend their hiatus on Valsalva. The state of the PFMs at rest appears to significantly influence biometric changes in the PFMs during contraction and Valsalva. © 2016.","Dyspareunia; Pelvic Floor Muscles; Provoked Vestibulodynia; Ultrasound Imaging; Vulvodynia","adult; Article; biometry; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; echography; female; human; levator hiatus; muscle contraction; pathophysiology; pelvis floor; priority journal; provoked vestibulodynia; rest; three dimensional imaging; transperineal ultrasound; Valsalva maneuver; vulvovaginal disease; Canada; clinical trial; echography; high-energy shock wave; multicenter study; pathology; pathophysiology; pelvis floor; procedures; therapeutic use; vulvodynia; Adult; Biometry; Canada; Female; High-Energy Shock Waves; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Muscle Contraction; Pelvic Floor; Rest; Valsalva Maneuver; Vulvodynia"

Calliper and ultrasonographic measurements of testicular dimensions (length, width and height) of both testes were taken on five adult collared peccaries. The testicular volume was calculated by Lambert's empiric formula: length (L) × width (W) × height (H) × 0.71, the formula of an ellipsoid L × W × H × 0.52, and Hansen's formula: L × W2 × 0.52. The calculated volumes were then compared with the actual ones, which were estimated by water displacement. The mean of true testicular volume was 22.65 ± 1.52 ml. Lambert's formula estimated testicular volume more accurately when ultrasound measurements were taken. However, when the calliper was the methodology used, the results were closest to the true volume, especially when Ellipsoid formula and Hansen's formula were applied, and underestimated the true volumes by 1.53 ± 1.75 ml and 1.53 ± 1.65 ml, respectively. This specific application of technologies in wild animals has the potential to revolutionize the selection process for the collared peccary entering artificial insemination or natural breeding programmes. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,"anatomy and histology; animal; Artiodactyla; biometry; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; echography; male; mathematical phenomena; orchiectomy; procedures; testis; veterinary; Animals; Artiodactyla; Biometry; Male; Mathematical Concepts; Orchiectomy; Testis; Ultrasonography"

Stochastic eye models are a method to generate random biometry data with the variability found in the general population for use in optical calculations. This work improves the accuracy of a previous model by including the higher-order shape parameters of the cornea. METHODS. The right eye biometry of 312 subjects (40.8 ± 11.0 years of age) were measured with an autorefractometer, a Scheimpflug camera, an optical biometer, and a ray tracing aberrometer. The corneal shape parameters, exported as Zernike coefficients, were converted to eigenvectors for dimensional reduction. The remaining 18 parameters were modeled as a sum of two multivariate Gaussians, from which an unlimited number of synthetic data sets (SyntEyes) were generated. After conversion back to Zernike coefficients, the data were introduced into ray tracing software. RESULTS. The mean values of nearly all SyntEyes parameters were statistically equal to thos0e of the original data (two one-sided t-test, P > 0.05/109, Bonferroni correction). The variability of the SyntEyes parameters was similar to the original data for most important shape parameters and intraocular distances (F-test, P < 0.05/109), but significantly lower for the higher-order shape parameters (F-test, P > 0.05/109). The same was seen for the correlations between higher-order shape parameters. After applying simulated cataract or refractive surgery to the SyntEyes model, a very close resemblance to previously published clinical outcome data was seen. CONCLUSIONS. The SyntEyes model produces synthetic biometry that closely resembles clinically measured data, including the normal biological variations in the general population. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

Setting Ein-Tal Eye Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel. Design Retrospective comparative case series. Methods Consecutive cases of toric IOL implantation and preoperative measurements by optical biometry with optical low-coherence reflectometry (OLCR) (Lenstar LS 900) and a Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam) were retrospectively reviewed. Five methods of toric IOL calculation were compared as follows: (1) anterior corneal astigmatism using OLCR, (2) application of the Baylor nomogram, (3) posterior tomography combined with anterior corneal measurements using vector summation, (4) the Scheimpflug camera's true net power, and (5) total corneal refractive power. Toric IOL astigmatic power and axis, aiming for the lowest residual astigmatism, were selected according to these methods. Simulated residual refraction was calculated for each method based on manifest refraction and measured IOL alignment more than 3 weeks after surgery. Results The study included 115 eyes of 92 patients. The median simulated residual astigmatism was lower when based on vector summation of anterior and posterior astigmatisms than with calculations based on anterior corneal measurements only, application of the Baylor nomogram, true net power, and total corneal refractive power readings (0.49 diopters [D] versus 0.70 D, 0.60 D, 0.64 D, and 0.76 D, respectively) (P <.001). Conclusions Residual astigmatism after toric IOL implantation can be reduced by appropriate consideration of the posterior corneal astigmatism.

However, the issue about whether blocking MSTN can inhibit obesity-induced bone loss has not been previously investigated. In the present study, we have evaluated the effects of MSTN blocking on bone quality in high-fat (HF), diet-induced obese rats using a prepared polyclonal antibody for MSTN (MsAb). Twenty-four rats were randomly assigned to the Control, HF and HF + MsAb groups. Rats in the HF + MsAb group were injected once a week with purified MsAb for eight weeks. The results showed that MsAb significantly reduced body and fat weight, and increased muscle mass and strength in the HF group. MicroCT analysis demonstrated that obesity-induced bone loss and architecture deterioration were significantly mitigated by MsAb treatment, as evidenced by increased bone mineral density, bone volume over total volume, trabecular number and thickness, and decreased trabecular separation and structure model index. However, neither HF diet nor MsAb treatment had an impact on femoral biomechanical properties including maximum load, stiffness, energy absorption and elastic modulus. Moreover, MsAb significantly increased adiponectin concentrations, and decreased TNF-α and IL-6 levels in diet-induced obese rats. Taken together, blocking MSTN by MsAb improves bone quality in diet-induced obese rats through a mechanotransduction pathway from skeletal muscle, and the accompanying changes occurring in the levels of circulating adipokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines may also be involved in this process. It indicates that the administration of MSTN antagonists may be a promising therapy for treating obesity and obesity-induced bone loss. © 2015, © 2015 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","adipokines; Myostatin; obesity; pro-inflammatory; trabecular bone microarchitectures","myostatin; anatomy and histology; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; biometry; bone; bone density; complication; diet; male; metabolism; obesity; osteolysis; prevention and control; signal transduction; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Biometry; Bone and Bones; Bone Density; Bone Resorption; Diet; Male; Myostatin; Obesity; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Signal Transduction"

Therefore, local hydrodynamics could be one of the environmental factors affecting traits of C. chromis with repercussions at the population level. We compared the body condition, individual growth and body shapes of damselfish collected under two different hydrodynamic conditions (low ~10 cm s-1 vs. high ~20 cm s-1). Specimens showed higher body condition under high-hydrodynamics, where conditions offered greater amounts of food, which were able to support larger individuals. Individuals smaller than 60-mm were more abundant under low-hydrodynamics.

Considering that dermatoglyphics is an important biometric method, due to it being practical and inexpensive, this longitudinal and retrospective study was aimed to evaluate the morphological variations in fingerprints obtained from men and women (n=20) during their adult and elderly stages of life; the time between obtaining the two fingerprints was 33.5±9.4 years. For the morphometric analysis, an area of 1 cm2 was selected to quantify the visible friction ridges, minutiae, interpapillary and white lines, and later side-by-side confrontation was used to determine the identity of the individuals. Our results showed a reduction of friction ridges, an increase in the number of white lines for the group (men and women) and a decrease in the number of interpapillary lines in the group of women. It also showed that the selection of compatible fingerprints by the automated AFIS/VRP system allowed the identification of 23 individuals (57.5%), but when the identification was made by the automated AFIS/VRP system, followed by the analysis of archived patterns to eliminate incompatible fingerprints, determination of the identity of 28 individuals (70.0%) was possible. The dermatoglyphics of the elderly suffered morphometric changes that prevented the identification of 30% of them, probably due to the aging process, and pointed to the importance of improving the methods of obtaining fingerprints to clarify issues related to the identification of the elderly. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Aging; Dermatoglyphics; Elderly; Identification; Morphometry","adult; adulthood; aged; aging; Article; automation; biometry; controlled study; female; finger dermatoglyphics; forensic identification; human; human experiment; image analysis; image quality; longitudinal study; male; morphometrics; normal human; occupation; priority journal; retrospective study; sex difference; statistical analysis; worker; age; aging; dermatoglyphics; middle aged; reproducibility; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Dermatoglyphics; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult"

The exact criteria to avoid DJK have been controversial. It has been recommended to include the SSV into the fusion by some authors, while others suggest that fusion to FLV is sufficient. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of DJK in relation to distal fusion level selection in SK surgery by investigating the relationship between the sagittal stable vertebra (SSV), first lordotic vertebra (FLV), and the lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV). Methods: 54 patients (mean age: 21.2 years, range 12–43; male/female: 20/34) with SK who were treated by posterior segmental instrumentation and fusion were prospectively evaluated. Patients were allocated into 3 groups according to distal fusion level. In group 1, SSV was chosen as LIV (n = 20), and in group 2, LIV was the FLV (n = 16). Third group consisted of 18 patients in whom SSV and FLV was the same vertebra. Distal junctional angle, sagittal plane analysis, and clinical outcomes according to SF-36 were evaluated. Results: Mean preoperative kyphosis angles were 77.2°, 73.4°, and 76.7° in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p = 0.281), which decreased to 38.1°, 37.3°, and 37.8° postoperatively at final follow-up (p = 0.988). Mean follow-up time was 28.3 months. Correction amounts were similar between the groups (p = 0.409). 3 patients in SSV group, 5 patients in FLV group, and 3 patients in SSV-FLV group developed DJK, which was statistically insignificant. The C7 sagittal plumbline, lumbar lordosis, and pelvic parameters were not significantly different before or after surgery between the groups. Preoperative and postoperative results of SF-36 questionnaire were similar in all the groups. None of the patients who had DJK required revision surgery during the follow-up time. Conclusion: Proper selection of distal fusion level is important in order to prevent DJK after SK surgery. According to this study, it is not necessary to extend the fusion down to the SSV.

Patients must perform self-retraining exercises of the perineal muscles at home in order to maintain the benefit of the physiotherapy. The aim of this study is to assess the benefit of a perineal electro-stimulator, using three-dimensional ultrasound, during this home-care phase. Materials and methods. A longitudinal prospective study was conducted between May 2012 and May 2013. All patients with de novo SUI benefited from PFMT followed by a self-maintenance of perineal rehabilitation at home with the Keat® Pro system. The primary endpoint was the biometric of the levator ani and it was assessed by three-dimensional perineal ultrasound at inclusion, after conventional rehabilitation and at the end of the study after self-rehabilitation. Ten patients were included. All patients (100%) showed a clinical improvement of SUI. The quality of life was significantly improved after PFMT vs. inclusion (PCombining double low line0.014) and after self-rehabilitation vs. after PFMT (PCombining double low line0.033). Levator ani muscles were significantly thicker after conventional rehabilitation than at baseline (PCombining double low line0.004) and significantly thicker after self-rehabilitation than after PFMT (PCombining double low line0.009). Conclusions Conducting self-rehabilitation in addition to conventional PFMT objectively improves the perineal muscle building achieved after conventional rehabilitation. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the effects of this class of compounds on neuro-cardiovascular system damage induced by high fat diet remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of incretin-based therapies on neuro-cardiovascular dysfunction induced by high fat diet in Wistar rats. Methods and Results We have evaluated fasting glucose levels and insulin resistance, heart rate variability quantified on time and frequency domains, cerebral microcirculation by intravital microscopy, mean arterial blood pressure, ventricular function and mitochondrial swelling. High fat diet worsened biometric and metabolic parameters and promoted deleterious effects on autonomic, myocardial and haemodynamic parameters, decreased capillary diameters and increased functional capillary density in the brain. Biometric and metabolic parameters were better improved by glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) compared with dipeptdyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. On the other hand, both GLP-1 agonist and DPP-4 inhibitor reversed the deleterious effects of high fat diet on autonomic, myocardial, haemodynamic and cerebral microvascular parameters. GLP-1 agonist and DPP-4 inhibitor therapy also increased mitochondrial permeability transition pore resistance in brain and heart tissues of rats subjected to high fat diet. Conclusion Incretin-based therapies improve deleterious cardiovascular effects induced by high fat diet and may have important contributions on the interplay between neuro-cardiovascular dynamic controls through mitochondrial dysfunction associated to metabolic disorders. © 2016 Marques-Neto et al.

This biologically rare phenomenon of the coexistence of males and hermaphrodites is termed androdioecy. To test whether the hermaphrodite and male sexes are fixed or plastic in the androdioecious pedunculate barnacle Octolasmis warwickii, we conducted a series of 22-day-long transplanting experiments to evaluate the effects of a) the original site (attached to the conspecific vs. attached directly to the substrate) and b) the transplanting site (conspecific-attached vs. substrate-attached). Penis length (as an index of male function), the presence or absence of egg mass (female function), and growth rate were investigated. As with natural dwarf males, individuals that were transplanted onto conspecifics developed longer penises than did those that were transplanted onto the substrate. The original site of attachment also affected penis length. However, no significant effects of the original site or the transplanting were detected in egg-laying activities, as only one experimental individual laid eggs. Individuals that were transplanted onto conspecifics grew less than those that were attached to the substrate. These results indicate that individual sexual expression is affected by the environment in O. warwickii. © 2016 Marine Biological Laboratory.",,"Cirripedia; Octolasmis warwickii; Pedunculata; Thoracica; anatomy and histology; animal; barnacle; biometry; male; penis; physiology; reproduction; sexual behavior; Animals; Biometry; Male; Penis; Reproduction; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Thoracica"

Setting Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, United Kingdom. Design Prospective case series. Methods Eyes having intrastromal AK for corneal cylinder correction were analyzed. Preoperative biometric parameters included axial length, anterior chamber depth, central corneal thickness, and Ocular Response Analyzer corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF). Preoperative and 1-month postoperative corneal keratometry was measured using the Topcon KR8100PA topographer-autorefractor. Astigmatic analyses were performed using the Alpins method. Results The study analyzed 319 eyes of 213 patients with a mean target induced astigmatism of 1.24 diopters (D) ± 0.44 (SD), mean surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) of 0.71 ± 0.43 D, and mean difference vector of 0.79 ± 0.41 D. Two multiple regression models were constructed for SIA prediction. Model 1, based on previous manual limbal relaxing incision parameters, confirmed age and astigmatism meridian (with/against the rule and oblique) to be associated with SIA in addition to AK arc length, AK start depth, and preoperative corneal cylinder magnitude. Model 2, additionally considering other parameters, found only lower CH (-0.06 DC per unit CH), a higher CRF (0.04 D per unit CRF), and the astigmatism meridian to be independent predictors of greater SIA (after adjusting for intrastromal AK arc length, start depth, and preoperative corneal cylinder). With-the-rule astigmatism was associated with a 0.13 D higher SIA than against-the-rule astigmatism, holding all other variables constant. Conclusion Corneal biomechanical parameters and astigmatism meridian were independent predictors of femtosecond laser intrastromal AK efficacy even after adjusting for AK arc length, AK start depth, and preoperative corneal cylinder.

More recently, controversial discussion was initiated by an editorial decision of a scientific journal [1] to refuse any paper submitted for publication containing null hypothesis testing procedures. Since the large majority of papers published in forensic journals propose the evaluation of statistical evidence based on the so called p-values, it is of interest to expose the discussion of this journal's decision within the forensic science community.

The parapapillary gamma zone has been defined as the parapapillary region without Bruch’s membrane. We examined which morphologic parameters are associated with the presence and size of the parapapillary gamma zone. Methods. Using fundus photographs and spectral-domain optical coherence tomographic images of the optic nerve head in the population-based Beijing Eye Study, we determined parapapillary gamma zone width, macular Bruch’s membrane length, optic disc-fovea distance, the angle of horizontal optic disc rotation, the angle of vertical optic disc rotation, and the ratio of the vertical-to-horizontal disc diameter. Results. The study included 2068 individuals with a mean age of 63.0 ± 9.0 years (range, 5091 years), and mean axial length was 23.2 ± 1.0 mm (range, 18.96-28.87 mm). In multivariate analysis, larger width of parapapillary gamma zone was associated with more marked vertical optic disc rotation (P < 0.001; standardized correlation coefficient β, 0.15; nonstandardized correlation coefficient B, 0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02, 0.03), more marked horizontal optic disc rotation (P = 0.02; β, 0.05; B, 0.01; 95% CI, 0.001, 0.01), longer axial length (P = 0.01; β, 0.07; B, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.01, 0.04), longer horizontal optic disc diameter (P = 0.02; β, 0.05; B, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01, 0.12), longer disc-fovea distance (P < 0.001; β, 0.25; B, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.18, 0.27), higher degree of fundus tessellation (P = 0.03; β, 0.17; B, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.03, 0.0), and thinner subfoveal choroidal thickness (P < 0.001; β, —0.13; B, 0.000; 95% CI, —0.001, 0.000). Parapapillary gamma zone width was not significantly associated with macular Bruch’s membrane length (P = 0.72), disc-fovea angle (P = 0.62), age (P = 0.62), or sex (P = 0.46). Conclusions. The parapapillary gamma zone was associated with an axial elongation-induced rotation of the optic disc mainly around the vertical disc axis, leading to a stretching of the temporal peripapillary scleral flange.

A 'stepped-down; version of the stepped-care approach to adolescent weight loss has never been evaluated. Objectives: We conducted a one-year randomized controlled trial to compare a stepped-down weight loss intervention versus enhanced usual care (EUC). Methods: Study participants were obese adolescents age 11-13 (N = 106, 51% girls, and 82% Hispanic) recruited from primary care clinics in San Diego, California. The stepped-down intervention was delivered through clinician and health educator counseling (in-person and by phone) and mailed content. The intervention consisted of four-month 'steps' beginning with the most intensive contact followed by reduced contact if treatment goals were met. The EUC group received an initial physician visit, one session with a health counselor, and monthly mailed materials. Body mass index (BMI kg/m2) was measured at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months. Mixed-model regression analyses were stratified by sex. Results: Results indicated a clinically significant treatment effect for boys on BMI (p &lt; 0.001) but not girls. No between group differences were found for adiposity and biometric outcomes. Only 13% of intervention participants succeeded in stepping down from step 1 to step 2 or step 3. Conclusions: A stepped-down approach to weight loss showed some evidence of efficacy for weight loss in boys but not girls. The findings suggest the program as designed was not intensive enough to result in weight loss in this population segment. © 2015 World Obesity.","Adolescents; obesity; primary-care intervention; stepped-down","adolescent; adolescent obesity; Article; behavior therapy; biometry; body height; body mass; body weight; child; controlled study; female; health education; Hispanic; human; major clinical study; male; patient counseling; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; school child; sex difference; treatment outcome; United States; weight reduction; adolescent behavior; California; directive counseling; epidemiology; Pediatric Obesity; procedures; program evaluation; psychology; weight loss program; weight reduction; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Behavior Therapy; Body Mass Index; California; Child; Directive Counseling; Female; Humans; Male; Pediatric Obesity; Program Evaluation; Weight Loss; Weight Reduction Programs"

Over the past several decades, researchers have proposed different algorithms for facial expression recognition, but there has been little focus on detection in real-Time scenarios. The present work proposes a new algorithmic method of automated marker placement used to classify six facial expressions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. Emotional facial expressions were captured using a webcam, while the proposed algorithm placed a set of eight virtual markers on each subject's face. Facial feature extraction methods, including marker distance (distance between each marker to the center of the face) and change in marker distance (change in distance between the original and new marker positions), were used to extract three statistical features (mean, variance, and root mean square) from the real-Time video sequence. The initial position of each marker was subjected to the optical flow algorithm for marker tracking with each emotional facial expression. Finally, the extracted statistical features were mapped into corresponding emotional facial expressions using two simple non-linear classifiers, K-nearest neighbor and probabilistic neural network. The results indicate that the proposed automated marker placement algorithm effectively placed eight virtual markers on each subject's face and gave a maximum mean emotion classification rate of 96.94% using the probabilistic neural network. © 2016 Maruthapillai, Murugappan.

The goals of this study were to (a) characterize age trajectories of state anxiety symptoms in the second half of life, and (b) estimate genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences in the age trajectory of state anxiety. This study was based on data from 1,482 participants in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging who were aged 50 and older at their first occasion (512 complete twin pairs, 458 singletons) and had up to 6 measurement occasions spanning 11 years. Consistent with life span developmental theories of age-related emotional change, anxiety symptom levels declined during the transition from midlife to the mid-60s, followed by a mild increase that gradually plateaued in the 80s. There were substantial individual differences in the age trajectory of anxiety. After accounting for effects of sex, cohort, mode of testing, and proximity to death, this longitudinal variation was partitioned into biometric sources. Nonshared environmental variance was highest in the late 60s and declined thereafter, whereas genetic variance increased at an accelerated pace from approximately age 60 onward. There was no evidence for effects of rearing or other shared environment on anxiety symptoms in later life. These findings highlight how the etiology of anxiety symptoms changes from midlife to old age. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Aging; Anxiety; Longitudinal study; Trajectory; Twin study","adoption; adult; aged; aging; anxiety; death; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; half life time; human; lifespan; major clinical study; PsycINFO; rearing; symptom; age; anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; biometry; cohort analysis; environment; female; genetics; genotype environment interaction; individuality; life event; male; middle aged; psychology; social environment; statistics and numerical data; Sweden; twin study; twins; very elderly; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Biometry; Cohort Studies; Death; Environment; Female; Gene-Environment Interaction; Humans; Individuality; Life Change Events; Male; Middle Aged; Social Environment; Sweden; Twin Studies as Topic; Twins"

First, a new image feature called Normalized Pixel Difference (NPD) is proposed. NPD feature is computed as the difference to sum ratio between two pixel values, inspired by the Weber Fraction in experimental psychology. The new feature is scale invariant, bounded, and is able to reconstruct the original image. Second, we propose a deep quadratic tree to learn the optimal subset of NPD features and their combinations, so that complex face manifolds can be partitioned by the learned rules. This way, only a single soft-cascade classifier is needed to handle unconstrained face detection. Furthermore, we show that the NPD features can be efficiently obtained from a look up table, and the detection template can be easily scaled, making the proposed face detector very fast. Experimental results on three public face datasets (FDDB, GENKI, and CMU-MIT) show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting unconstrained faces with arbitrary pose variations and occlusions in cluttered scenes. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","AdaBoost; cascade classifier; normalized pixel difference; regression tree; Unconstrained face detection","Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Forestry; Pixels; Product development; Table lookup; Cascade classifiers; Cluttered scenes; Detection templates; normalized pixel difference; Original images; Regression trees; Scale invariant; State-of-the-art performance; Face recognition; algorithm; anatomy and histology; biometry; face; factual database; human; image processing; machine learning; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; software; Algorithms; Biometric Identification; Databases, Factual; Face; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; ROC Curve; Software"

Of particular importance to the assessment of health and fitness of fish stocks in response to environmental conditions or pollution are morphometric (e.g. Fulton's condition index) and somatic indices (e.g. hepatosomatic, and gonadosomatic index). Standard measurements of somatic indices are invasive and require, by definition, the sacrifice of examined animals, thus prohibiting longitudinal studies and relocation of animals captured in the field. As a potential solution, in the present study, we propose the use of micro-computed tomography (μCT) as imaging modality to non-invasively tomographically image rainbow trout (. Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to different sediment suspensions. We here demonstrate that μCT can be used as a tool to reliably measure the volumes of different organs, which could then be applied as a substitute of their weights in calculation of somatic indices. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the results of μCT analyses in the context of ecotoxicological research in rainbow trout. It has the potential to greatly increase the information value of experiments conducted with fish and also to potentially reduce the number of animals required for studying temporal effects through facilitating longitudinal studies within the same individuals. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Biometry; Condition index; Liver somatic index; Micro-computed tomography","Animals; Computerized tomography; Pollution control; Tomography; Water quality; Assessment of water qualities; Biometry; Condition index; Environmental conditions; Liver somatic indices; Microcomputed tomography; Rainbow trouts (Oncorhynchus mykiss); Standard measurements; Fish; biometry; ecotoxicology; morphometry; salmonid; tomography; Article; calculation; controlled study; ecotoxicology; liver weight; longitudinal study; micro-computed tomography; morphometrics; nonhuman; Oncorhynchus mykiss; priority journal; sediment; water pollution; water quality; animal; ecotoxicology; environmental monitoring; metabolism; Oncorhynchus mykiss; physiology; procedures; toxicity; water pollutant; Animalia; Oncorhynchus mykiss; water pollutant; Animals; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Monitoring; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Water Pollutants, Chemical; X-Ray Microtomography"

However, the problem continues to be challenging due to the large variability in expression, illumination, pose, and the existence of occlusions in real-world face images. In this paper, we present a dual sparse constrained cascade regression model for robust face alignment. Instead of using the least-squares method during the training process of regressors, sparse constraint is introduced to select robust features and compress the size of the model. Moreover, sparse shape constraint is incorporated between each cascade regression, and the explicit shape constraints are able to suppress the ambiguity in local features. To improve the model's adaptation to large pose variation, face pose is estimated by five fiducial landmarks located by deep convolutional neuron network, which is used to adaptively design the cascade regression model. To the best of our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to fuse explicit shape constraint (sparse shape constraint) and implicit context information (sparse feature selection) for robust face alignment in the framework of cascade regression. Extensive experiments on nine challenging wild data sets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods. © 2015 IEEE.","Cascade regression; Robust face alignment; Sparse feature selection; Sparse shape constraint","Alignment; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Least squares approximations; Neural networks; Context information; Face alignment; Facial landmark; Least squares methods; Regression model; Shape constraints; State-of-the-art methods; Training process; Regression analysis; algorithm; anatomy and histology; biometry; face; human; image processing; procedures; regression analysis; Algorithms; Biometric Identification; Face; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Regression Analysis"

Despite the increasing production of tambaqui (annual growth of approximately 8%), no study has addressed the effects of farming on tambaqui's reproductive physiology and growth performance. As part of an institutional portfolio that aims to increase the production of tambaqui per area of cultivation, the present work details the tambaqui's gametogenesis and steroidogenesis during 10. months of farming, until they reached the market size. Spermatogenesis is very precocious (750. g fish) and apparently is a rapid and constant process in tambaqui testes, with major concentration of mature fish in August. On the other hand, oogenesis is a much longer process that starts only in fish at around 1200. g and does not complete before harvesting (no mature female observed). The plasmatic concentration of sex steroids is very similar among immature male and female tambaqui. However, testosterone and estradiol rise in parallel with testis development while only the second rises with ovarian primary growth. Concentration of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone remains at basal levels during spermatogenesis of farmed tambaqui, but it slightly increases during oocyte primary growth. At harvest, the biometrical analysis reveals that female and male tambaqui yield different gutted weight in the order of 16% in favor of the former. Most probably due to the precocious gonad maturation that farmed males go through (5. m old), females are heavier at harvest (12. m old) and therefore stand out as the most profitable gender to be produced in the tambaqui farming industry. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aquaculture; Fish; Gametogenesis; Puberty; Reproduction; Sex steroid","biometry; body mass; experimental culture; finfish; freshwater ecosystem; gametogenesis; growth response; male; maturation; native species; reproductive biology; steroid; weight; Brazil; Colossoma macropomum; Colossoma marcopomum"

Two factors were found that explained the deviation of the target refraction using the Holladay 1 formula; that is, the ratio of the corneal radii and the AL and the ratio of corneal radii for the SRK/T formula. A new IOL adjustment calculator was derived and validated at a second center using 14 eyes (10 patients). Conclusions The error in IOL calculation for normal eyes after laser refractive treatment was related to the ratio of posterior-to-anterior corneal radius. A formula requiring Scheimpflug data and suggested IOL power only yielded an improved postoperative result for patients with previous corneal laser refractive surgery having cataract surgery.

The informal and formal security analysis of our scheme are given, which demonstrate that our scheme satisfies the desirable security requirements. The presented scheme provides a variety of significant functionalities, in which some features are not considered in the most of existing authentication schemes, such as, user revocation or re-registration and biometric information protection. Compared with several related schemes, our scheme has more secure properties and lower computation cost. It is obviously more appropriate for practical applications in the remote distributed networks. © 2016 Wang et al.

Behavioural flexibility is an important factor in estimating the adaptive potential of both individuals and populations, and predicting the degree to which they can cope with change. Study Design: This study on the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is an empiric illustration of the degree of behavioural variation that can emerge between semi-natural systems within only a single generation. Wild-caught adult sticklebacks (P, N = 400) were randomly distributed in equal densities over 20 standardized semi-natural environments (ponds), and one year later offspring (F1, N = 652) were presented with repeated behavioural assays. Individuals were challenged to reach a food source through a novel transparent obstacle, during which exploration, activity, foraging, sociability and wall-biting behaviours were recorded through video observation. We found that coping responses of individuals from the first generation to this unfamiliar foraging challenge were related to even relatively small, naturally diversified variation in developmental environment. All measured behaviours were correlated with each other. Especially exploration, sociability and wall-biting were found to differ significantly between ponds. These differences could not be explained by stickleback density or the turbidity of the water. Findings: Our findings show that a) differences in early-life environment appear to affect stickleback feeding behaviour later in life; b) this is the case even when the environmental differences are only small, within natural parameters and diversified gradually; and c) effects are present despite semi-natural conditions that fluctuate during the year. Therefore, in behaviourally plastic animals like the stickleback, the adaptive response to human-induced habitat disturbance may occur rapidly (within one generation) and vary strongly based on the system's (starting) conditions. This has important implications for the variability in animal behaviour, which may be much larger than expected from studying laboratory systems, as well as for the validity of predictions of population responses to change. © 2016 Langenhof et al.

Human electrocardiogram (ECG) has been recently proposed as an additional tool for biometric applications. Then, a set of ECG-based biometric studies has occurred in the literature, but they are difficult to compare because they use various values of: the number of ECG leads, the length of the analysis window (only the QRS or more), the delays between recordings$$\ldots $$… However, they analyse nearly always the ECG in rest conditions. Here, we propose to evaluate the possibility of performing ECG-based biometry in other conditions. For this purpose, a comparative study, on three experimental conditions (supine rest, standing and exercise), has been carried out. It is based on the computing of the correlation coefficient between pairs of shapes of windowed ECG. Both verification and identification tasks are tackled. The results show that there is no advantage in comparing shapes recorded in supine rest conditions, as it is classically done, which represents an obvious benefit in biometry. Performances are evaluated as a function of the shape length. Then, different tests are performed in order to investigate how should be constructed the enrolment database when a system is devoted to work in several conditions. Last part of the paper shows how performances depend on the time and on the number of ECG leads. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.","Biometrics; Electrocardiogram; Identification; Verification","Biometrics; Identification (control systems); Verification; Analysis windows; Biometric analysis; Biometric applications; Biometric systems; Comparative studies; Correlation coefficient; Experimental conditions; Physiological recordings; Electrocardiography"

However, few studies have measured fetal biometry longitudinally, remaining unclear as to whether there are windows of special vulnerability. Objective: The aim was to investigate the impact of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure on fetal and neonatal biometry in the Spanish INMA study. Methods: Biparietal diameter (BPD), femur length (FL), abdominal circumference (AC), and estimated fetal weight (EFW) were evaluated for up to 2,478 fetuses in each trimester of pregnancy. Size at 12, 20, and 34 weeks of gestation and growth between these points, as well as anthropometry at birth, were assessed by SD scores derived using cohort-specific growth curves. Temporally adjusted land-use regression was used to estimate exposure to NO2 at home addresses for up to 2,415 fetuses. Associations were investigated by linear regression in each cohort and subsequent meta-analysis. Results: A 10-μg/m3 increase in average exposure to NO2 during weeks 0-12 was associated with reduced growth at weeks 0-12 in AC (-2.1%; 95% CI: -3.7, -0.6) and EFW (-1.6%; 95% CI: -3.0, -0.3). The same exposure was inversely associated with reduced growth at weeks 20-34 in BPD (-2.6%; 95% CI: -3.9, -1.2), AC (-1.8%; 95% CI: -3.3, -0.2), and EFW (-2.1%; 95% CI: -3.7, -0.2). A less consistent pattern of association was observed for FL. The negative association of this exposure with BPD and EFW was significantly stronger in smoking versus nonsmoking mothers. Conclusions: Maternal exposure to NO2 in early pregnancy was associated with reduced fetal growth based on ultrasound measures of growth during pregnancy and measures of size at birth. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

There were 1889 subjects included with full data of refraction and ocular components. As expected, mean axial length was significantly longer in myopic eyes compared to emmetropes. Girls had steeper corneas, more powerful lenses and shorter eyes than boys. Lens power was lower in boys and also lower in myopic eyes. Lens thickness was the same for both genders but was lower in myopic eyes. Although cornea was steeper in myopic eyes in the whole sample, this was a gender effect (more girls in the myopic group) as this difference disappeared when the analysis was split by gender.

Genetic and nongenetic factors seem to play an important role in premature arterial disease. Endothelium may be significant for long-term remodeling of the arterial wall. The aim of the study was to assess fetal endothelial and renal function in late-onset gestational hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a case-controlled study. Singleton pregnancies affected by late-onset gestational hypertension (after 34 weeks' gestation) and controls were included. Ultrasound examinations (fetal biometry, fetal Doppler, fetal aorta intima media thickness (aIMT), fetal kidney volumes, maternal Doppler, presence of uterine arteries protodiastolic notching from anomaly scan) and clinical data were collected. A sample of amniotic fluid was taken at delivery. RESULTS Fifty patients with late-onset hypertension and 50 controls were included. At growth scan (weeks 29-32) we found in the study group significantly higher fetal aIMT, umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI), fetal aorta PI, and mean uterine arteries PI with persistent bilateral notch. In the case group microalbuminuria levels were significantly higher than controls (1.32±0.11 vs. 1.10±0.13g/l, P < 0.0001), and there was a negative correlation between renal fetal volume at growth scan and amniotic microalbuminuria (r: -0.95, 95% C -0.97 to -0.90, P < 0.0001).

Methods: Patients with a stable myopic refraction (myopia worse than -1.00D spherical equivalent) were prospectively recruited. Angle status was assessed using gonioscopy and biometric measurements were performed using an anterior segment optical coherence tomography and an IOLMaster. Results: A total of 29 patients (58 eyes) were enrolled with 13 patients (26 eyes) classified as having narrow angles and 16 patients (32 eyes) classified as having open angles. Baseline demographics of age, sex, and ethnicity did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. The patients with narrow angles were on average older than those with open angles but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P=0.12). The central anterior chamber depth was significantly less in the eyes with narrow angles (P=0.05). However, the average lens thickness, although greater in the eyes with narrow angles, did not reach statistical significance (P=0.10). Refractive error, axial lengths, and iris thicknesses did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (P=0.32, 0.47, 0.15). Conclusions: Narrow angles can occur in myopic eyes. Routine gonioscopy is therefore recommended for all patients regardless of refractive error. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

To determine the best statistical methods and intereye RNFL cutoffs for differentiating between normal and glaucoma subjects to better alert clinicians to early glaucomatous damage. Methods: Sixty-six primary open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and 40 age-matched normal subjects had both eyes imaged at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary with a commercially available spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) machine. Statistical methodologies were used to find cutoffs that achieved the best sensitivities and specificities for differentiating OAG from normal subjects. Results: Intereye RNFL asymmetry for global average, all quadrants, and all sectors was significantly greater in OAG than normal subjects. Intereye RNFL asymmetry for global average showed the greatest statistical difference (P<0.001) between OAG (23.64± 14.90 μm) and normal eyes (3.58±3.96 μm), with 6.60 times greater asymmetry in OAG eyes. The inferior quadrant showed the second greatest difference, with 3.91 times greater asymmetry in OAG eyes. Using a statistically determined cutoff of 6.0 μm as abnormal, intereye RNFL asymmetry for global average achieved a sensitivity of 74.24% and specificity of 90% in differentiating between normal and OAG subjects, achieving a better combination of sensitivity and specificity than intereye RNFL asymmetry of any quadrant or sector. Conclusions: Intereye RNFL asymmetry may be a useful clinical OCT measurement to provide quantitative assessment of early glaucomatous damage. Newly developed algorithms for intereye RNFL asymmetry may improve the ability to detect glaucoma. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Although poorly understood, possible long-term neurological consequences of repetitive sports-related concussions have received increased recognition and attention in recent years. A better understanding of the risk factors for concussion remains a public health priority. Despite the attention focused on mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in football, gaps remain in the understanding of the optimal methodology to determine concussion incidence and position-specific risk factors. Purpose: To calculate the rates of concussion in professional football players using established and novel metrics on a group and position-specific basis. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Athletes from the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 National Football League (NFL) seasons were included in this analysis of publicly available data. Concussion incidence rates were analyzed using established (athlete exposure [AE], game position [GP]) and novel (position play [PP]) metrics cumulatively, by game unit and position type (offensive skill players and linemen, defensive skill players and linemen), and by position. Results: In 480 games, there were 292 concussions, resulting in 0.61 concussions per game (95% CI, 0.54-0.68), 6.61 concussions per 1000 AEs (95% CI, 5.85-7.37), 1.38 concussions per 100 GPs (95% CI, 1.22-1.54), and 0.17 concussions per 1000 PPs (95% CI, 0.15-0.19). Depending on the method of calculation, the relative order of at-risk positions changed. In addition, using the PP metric, offensive skill players had a significantly greater rate of concussion than offensive linemen, defensive skill players, and defensive linemen (P <;.05). Conclusion: For this study period, concussion incidence by position and unit varied depending on which metric was used. Compared with AE and GP, the PP metric found that the relative risk of concussion for offensive skill players was significantly greater than other position types. The strengths and limitations of various concussion incidence metrics need further evaluation. Clinical Relevance: A better understanding of the relative risks of the different positions/units is needed to help athletes, team personnel, and medical staff make optimal player safety decisions and enhance rules and equipment. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","athlete exposures; concussion; concussion incidence; game positions; mTBI; National Football League; position plays; risk assessment","Article; athlete; athlete exposure; biometry; case control study; concussion; football; game position; human; incidence; medical staff; position play; priority journal; risk assessment"

Due to the changes of angle and position of the palm in a capturing process, as well as the defocus of device, it is inevitable to have some distortions in translation, rotation, and image blurriness, which would degrade the performance of a palmprint recognition system. In order to effectively solve the low recognition problem due to image blurriness, we propose a robust palmprint recognition system in this paper by using the fast Vese-Osher decomposition model to process the blurred palmprint images. First, a Gaussian defocus degradation model (GDDM) is proposed to characterize the image blurriness, and we can observe from this model that there are some stable features in the palmprint images with different scale of blurriness. Second, the structure layer and texture layer of blurred palmprint images are obtained by using the fast Vese-Osher decomposition model, and the structure layer is proved to be more stable and robust than the texture layer for palmprint recognition. Consequently, a novel algorithm based on the weighted histogram of oriented gradient for locally selected pattern (WHOG-LSP) is proposed and it is used to extract some robust features from the structure layer of blurred palmprint images. These extracted features can be used to address low performance issues associated with translation and rotation in palmprint recognition. Finally, the normalized correlation coefficient (NCC) is used to measure the similarity of palmprint features for the proposed recognition system. Extensive experiments on the PolyU palmprint database and the blurred PolyU palmprint database validate the effectiveness and real-time applicability of the proposed recognition system. In addition, an experiment is carried out in the IIT Delhi Touchless Palmprint Database for verifying the robustness of the proposed method. © 2015.","Biometrics; Robust palmprint recognition; Stable feature extraction; The fast VO decomposition model; Weighted histogram of oriented gradient for locally selected pattern","Algorithms; Anthropometry; Biometrics; Database systems; Feature extraction; Graphic methods; Image processing; Decomposition model; Degradation model; Normalized correlation coefficient; Performance issues; PolyU Palmprint Database; Recognition systems; Touch-less palmprint; Weighted histogram; Palmprint recognition; algorithm; Article; biometry; controlled study; correlation coefficient; data base; fast variation Vese Osher decomposition model; Gaussian defocus degradation model; human; image analysis; image processing; normalized correlation coefficient; palmprint; priority journal; statistical model; validation study; weighted histogram of oriented gradient for locally selected pattern"

In addition, higher plasma cortisol, glucose and triglycerides levels found in the lowest stocking density tested suggest an activation of the stress system in fish held at this condition.

Design: This was a prospective clinical study. Patients and methods: A total of 40 eyes of 27 patients with corneal astigmatism greater than 1.0 diopter (D) underwent cataract surgery with implantation of Precizon® toric IOL. IOL power calculation was performed using optical coherence biometry (IOLMaster®).

Results: The median postoperative UDVA was better than preoperative best-spectacle corrected distance visual acuity (0.02 [0.06] logMAR vs 0.19 [0.20] logMAR, P?0.001). At 6 months, postoperative UDVA was 0.1 logMAR or better in 95% of the eyes. At last follow-up, the mean spherical equivalent was reduced from -3.35±3.10 D to -0.02±0.30 D (P?0.001) with 97.5% of the eyes within ±0.50 D of emmetropia.

Extending their research, we propose a Bayesian approach to estimating the causal vaccine effects on binary post-infection outcomes. The identifiability of the causal vaccine effect VEI is discussed under different assumptions on selection bias. The performance of the proposed Bayesian method is compared with the maximum likelihood method through simulation studies and two case studies - a clinical trial of a rotavirus vaccine candidate and a field study of pertussis vaccination.

We then fit a multistate model and estimated accuracy, bias and precision of state-specific φ, p and Ψ to better understand the effects of FRE on different simulation scenarios. As expected, φ, and p, decreased in accuracy with FRE, with lower accuracy when CHs were simulated under a shorter-term study and a lower number of releases per capture occasion (lower sample size). Accuracy of Ψ estimates were robust to FRE except in those CH scenarios simulated using low sample size. The effect of FRE on bias was not consistent among parameters and differed by CH scenario. As expected, φ was negatively biased with increased FRE (except for the low φ low p CH scenario simulated with a low sample size), but we found that the magnitude of bias differed by scenario (high p CH scenarios were more negatively biased). State transition was relatively unbiased, except for the low p CH scenarios simulated with a low sample size, which were positively biased with FRE, and high p CH scenarios simulated with a low sample size. The effect of FRE on precision was not consistent among parameters and differed by scenario and sample size. Precision of φ decreased with FRE and was lowest with the low φ low p CH scenarios. Precision of p estimates also decreased with FRE under all scenarios, except the low φ high p CH scenarios. However, precision of Ψ increased with FRE, except for those CH scenarios simulated with a low sample size. Our results demonstrate how FRE leads to loss of accuracy in parameter estimates in a multistate model with the exception of Ψ when estimated using an adequate sample size.

Here we describe the comparison of screening procedures for hydrolases to be used for the hydrolysis of β-keto esters, the first step in the preparation of β-Amino acids. Two of the tested high throughput screening (HTS) assays depend on coupled enzymatic reactions which detect the alcohol released during ester hydrolysis by luminescence or absorption. The third assay detects the pH shift due to acid formation using an indicator dye. To choose the most efficient approach for screening, we assessed these assays with different statistical methods-namely, the classical Z'-factor, standardized mean difference (SSMD), the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Test, and t-statistics. This revealed that all three assays are suitable for HTS, the pH assay performing best. Based on our data we discuss the explanatory power of different statistical measures. Finally, we successfully employed the pH assay to identify a very fast hydrolase in an enzyme-substrate screening. © 2016 Bub et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"acetaldehyde; acetophenone; alcohol; alcohol oxidase; beta keto acid; beta keto ester; bromothymol blue; carbon dioxide; carbonic acid; ester; esterase; hydrogen peroxide; hydrolase; oxoacid; peroxidase; triacylglycerol lipase; unclassified drug; amino acid; ester; absorption; Article; assay; controlled study; decarboxylation; enzyme activity; enzyme mechanism; high throughput screening; hydrolysis; intermethod comparison; Kolmogorov Smirnov test; luminescence; luminometric assay; oxidative luminescence assay; pH; pH indicator assay; pH measurement; standardized mean difference analysis; statistical analysis; t statistics; Z factor analysis; biometry; biosynthesis; chemical model; chemical structure; chemistry; enzyme assay; enzyme specificity; high throughput screening; hydrolysis; kinetics; metabolism; procedures; stereoisomerism; Amino Acids; Biometry; Enzyme Assays; Esterases; Esters; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrolysis; Kinetics; Models, Chemical; Molecular Structure; Stereoisomerism; Substrate Specificity"

To describe key developments of optical biometry and optical coherence tomography (OCT) for ophthalmic applications made by one of the pioneering research groups. METHODS. Partial coherence interferometry (PCI) as the basic ranging technology for modern optical biometry and for OCT was introduced for biomedical applications in the 1980s. Later, Fourier domain (FD) OCT was introduced and demonstrated to provide superior sensitivity as compared to time domain OCT. Further developments comprised ultrahigh-resolution OCT and deep-penetration OCT at wavelengths of approximately 1050 nm. Important functional extensions comprise Doppler OCT/OCT angiography, polarization-sensitive OCT, and adaptive optics OCT. RESULTS. High-precision PCI biometry has found extensive applications in cataract surgery and in research on intraocular lens design. Optical coherence tomography, especially in the second-generation variant of FD OCT, is now indispensable for ocular diagnostics in general and for retinal diagnostics in particular; 1050 nm OCT shows improved penetration into deeper layers like the choroid. CONCLUSIONS. The contributions of the Vienna research group helped to establish PCI biometry and FD OCT as the gold standards in their respective fields. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a single referral center. The study included 23 894 singleton pregnancies scanned between 19 and 24 weeks of gestation. Maternal demographics included age, body mass index and ethnicity. Fetal biometry, birthweight and uterine artery pulsatility index values were converted into centiles. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed and the predictive accuracy was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The main outcome measure was prediction of delivery of preterm and term SGA neonates defined as a birthweight in the lowest centile groups (<10th, <5th and <3rd centiles). Results Maternal ethnicity, fetal biometry and uterine artery Doppler indices were significantly associated with the risk of SGA <5th centile (p < 0.01). Maternal factors or fetal biometry alone showed poor to moderate performance in prediction of term and preterm SGA <5th centile at a 10% false-positive rate. Uterine artery pulsatility index alone was able to predict 25, 60 and 77% of SGA <5th centile delivering at >37, <37 and <32 weeks of gestation respectively at a 10% false-positive rate; maternal factors, fetal biometry and uterine artery Doppler combined detected 40, 66 and 89% of term, preterm and very preterm SGA <5th centile at a 10% false-positive rate. Conclusions Second-trimester screening can identify the majority of pregnancies at high risk of SGA birth and showed a higher performance for earlier gestational ages at birth and lower birthweight centiles. © 2015 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.","fetal biometry; maternal demographics; prediction of high risk pregnancies; second-trimester screening; Small-for-gestational age; uterine artery Doppler","adult; age; Article; biometry; body mass; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; delivery; demography; Doppler echography; ethnicity; female; fetus; gestational age; human; major clinical study; outcome assessment; patient referral; prediction; premature labor; priority journal; retrospective study; second trimester pregnancy; small for date infant; uterine artery; biometry; birth weight; demography; echography; ethnic group; maternal age; newborn; predictive value; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; procedures; risk factor; second trimester pregnancy; small for date infant; uterine artery; Adult; Biometry; Birth Weight; Body Mass Index; Demography; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Small for Gestational Age; Maternal Age; Predictive Value of Tests; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Uterine Artery"

Methods-We conducted a retrospective analysis of women with sonographic biometry after 26 weeks' gestational age (GA) followed by delivery of term and preterm neonates from 2007 through 2011. The head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, and estimated fetal weight were obtained. Sonographic data were merged with birth certificate and neonatal data. Biometry and estimated fetal weight were divided into percentile thresholds: 10th and above (reference), below 10th, below 5th, and below 3rd. Neonatal outcomes included neonatal intensive care unit admission, 5-minute Apgar score less than 7, and a composite of any morbidity/mortality (hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, renal failure, or death). Logistic regression yielded odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for biometry and outcome, then adjusted for GA at delivery. Results-A total of 2237 patients delivered at term, and 455 delivered before term. Neonatal intensive care unit admission was not associated with any biometric threshold in the term and preterm groups. Five-minute Apgar score less than 7 was associated with head circumference below 10th, abdominal circumference below 3rd, and estimated fetal weight below 5th percentiles in the term group and head circumference below 10th, abdominal circumference below 10th, and femur length below 10th percentiles in the preterm group (P < .05). Composite morbidity/mortality was associated with abdominal circumference below 5th, femur length below 10th, and femur length below 3rd percentiles in the term group and head circumference below 5th, abdominal circumference below 10th, and femur length below 5th percentiles in the preterm group (P< .05). Adjustment for GA did not affect outcomes for term deliveries but did affect nearly all outcomes for preterm deliveries. Conclusions-Irrespective of GA, no one biometric threshold can accurately predict adverse neonatal outcomes. © 2016 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.","Fetal biometry; Intrauterine growth restriction; Neonatal outcome; Obstetric ultrasound","Biometrics; Diseases; Fetal monitoring; Intensive care units; Risk perception; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonography; Fetal biometry; Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathies; Intrauterine growth restriction; Logistic regressions; Neonatal intensive care units; Neonatal outcome; Periventricular leukomalacia; Retrospective analysis; Bone; biometry; body size; epidemiology; female; Fetal Growth Retardation; fetus death; fetus echography; fetus weight; human; incidence; Infant, Newborn, Diseases; mortality; New York; newborn; pregnancy; prevalence; procedures; prognosis; reproducibility; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; statistics and numerical data; third trimester pregnancy; Biometry; Body Size; Female; Fetal Death; Fetal Growth Retardation; Fetal Weight; Humans; Incidence; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Newborn, Diseases; New York; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Prevalence; Prognosis; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity; Ultrasonography, Prenatal"

Most hospitals and clinics in Israel use growth curves from the United States. Charts developed in different populations do not perform well in the Israeli population. Objectives: To construct new reference charts for fetal biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC) and femur length (FL), using a large sampleb of fetuses examined at 14–42 weeks gestational age in a medical center and a community ultrasound unit located in two different regions of Israel. Methods: Data from the medical center and the community clinic were pooled. The mean and standard error of each measure for each week was calculated. Based on these, reference charts were calculated using quantiles of the normal distribution. The performance of the reference charts was assessed by comparing the new values to empiric quantiles. Results: Biometric measurements were obtained for 79,328 fetuses. Growth charts were established based on these measurements.The overall performance of the curves was very good, with only a few exceptions among the higher quantiles in the third trimester in the medical center subsample. Conclusions: We present new local reference charts for fetal biometry, derived from a large and minimally selected Israeli population.

We hypothesized that maternal overweight/obesity, a state of low-grade inflammation and risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcome, could negatively influence placental development and that differences would be sex-specific. Methods 696 women (537 normal-weight, NW; 112 overweight, OW; 47 obese, OB) with singleton uncomplicated pregnancies were prospectively enrolled at term delivery. Gestational age, maternal (age, height, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain -GWG, hemoglobin, hematocrit and glycemia), fetal (weight, length, ponderal index, cranial circumference) and placental (weight, diameters) data were collected. Placental area, thickness and efficiency (fetal/placental weight ratio, F/P) were calculated. Results GWG was within standard recommendations in OB, while OW exceeded it. Placental weight was significantly higher in OW versus NW, but not in OB, leading to significantly higher placental thickness and lower F/P in this group. In the total population, a significant interaction effect between maternal BMI and fetal sex on placental weight and efficiency was found. Indeed, differences in placental parameters were present only in female offspring. Discussion In our population of OW and OB uncomplicated pregnancies only OW women, presenting GWG over standard recommendations, had thicker and less efficient placentas. We also reported different placental adaptation depending on fetal sex, with significant changes only in female fetuses. This may be part of a female-specific strategy aiming to ensure survival if another adverse event occurs. Customized counseling according to maternal BMI and fetal sex should be evaluated in clinical care. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Subject number in percent per age category reflected the percentage within the respective age band of the population of Leipzig, Germany. Methods: Measurements obtained: Subjective and objective refraction, best-corrected visual acuity, accommodation, contrast sensitivity, topography and pachymetry with Scheimpflug camera, axial length with non-contact partial coherence interferometry, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography of the retina. Pearson correlation coefficients with corresponding p-values were given to present interrelationships between stature, biometric and refractive parameters or their associations with age. Two-sample T-tests were used to calculate gender differences. The area under the logarithmic contrast sensitivity function (AULCSF) was calculated for the analysis of contrast sensitivity as a single figure across a range of spatial frequencies. Results: The results of axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and anterior chamber volume (ACV) differed as a function of the age of the participants (rho (p value): AL -0.19 (0.006), ACD -0.56 (< 0.001), ACV-0.52 (< 0.001)). Longer eyes had deeper ACD (AL:ACD 0.62 (< 0.001), greater ACV (AL:ACV 0.65 (< 0.001) and steeper corneal radii (AL:R1ant; R2ant; R1post; R2post 0.40; 0.35; 0.36; 0.36 (all with (< 0.001)). Spherical equivalent was associated with age (towards hyperopia: 0.34 (< 0.001)), AL (-0.66 (< 0.001)), ACD (-0.52 (< 0.001)) and ACV (-0.46 (< 0.001)). Accommodation was found lower for older subjects (negative association with age, r = -0.82 (< 0.001)) and contrast sensitivity presented with smaller values for older ages (AULCSF -0.38, (< 0.001)), no change of retinal thickness with age. 58 % of the study cohort presented with a change of refractive correction above ±0.50 D in one or both eyes (64 % of these were habitual spectacle wearers), need for improvement was present in the young age-group and for older subjects with increasing age. Conclusion: Biometrical data of healthy German eyes, stratified by age, gender and refractive status, enabled cross-comparison of all parameters, providing an important reference database for future patient-based research and specific in-depth investigations of biometric data in epidemiological research. © 2016 Zocher et al.","Cross section; Dioptric distance; Gullstrand; Ocular biometry; Visual function","accommodation; adult; aged; aging; anterior eye chamber; biometry; contrast sensitivity; cross-sectional study; eye axis length; eye refraction; female; Germany; human; keratometry; lens; male; middle aged; physiology; procedures; visual acuity; visual system function; young adult; Accommodation, Ocular; Adult; Aged; Aging; Anterior Chamber; Axial Length, Eye; Biometry; Contrast Sensitivity; Corneal Topography; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Germany; Humans; Lens, Crystalline; Male; Middle Aged; Ocular Physiological Phenomena; Refraction, Ocular; Visual Acuity; Young Adult"

To examine ocular growth in nonhuman primates (NHPs) from measurements on ex vivo eyes. METHODS. We obtained NHP eyes from animals that had been killed as part of other studies or because of health-related issues. Digital calipers were used to measure the horizontal, vertical, and anteroposterior globe diameters as well as corneal horizontal and vertical diameters of excised globes from 98 hamadryas baboons, 551 cynomolgus monkeys, and 112 rhesus monkeys, at ages ranging from 23 to 360 months. Isolated lens sagittal thickness and equatorial diameter were measured by shadowphotogrammetry. Wet and fixed dry weights were obtained for lenses. RESULTS. Nonhuman primate globe growth continues throughout life, slowing toward an asymptotic maximum. The final globe size scales with negative allometry to adult body size. Corneal growth ceases at around 20 months. Lens diameter increases but thickness decreases with increasing age. Nonhuman primate lens wet and dry weight accumulation is monophasic, continuing throughout life toward asymptotic maxima. The dry/wet weight ratio reaches a maximum of 0.33. CONCLUSIONS. Nonhuman primate ocular globe and lens growth differ in several respects from those in humans. Although age-related losses of lens power and accommodative amplitude are similar, lens growth and properties are different indicating care should be taken in extrapolating NHP observations to the study of human accommodation. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

Setting Department of Ophthalmology, Helios Hospital Erfurt, Erfurt, Julius-Maximilians University, Würzburg, and Philipps University, Marburg, Germany. Design Prospective comparative multicenter clinical study. Methods Biometry was taken with the use of 3 different biometers: the IOLMaster 700 swept-source biometer, the PCI-based IOLMaster 500, and the OCLR-based Lenstar LS 900. Axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and spherical equivalent (SE) were compared between swept-source and PCI biometry and central corneal thickness (CCT) and lens thickness (LT) between swept-source and OLCR biometry. The repeatability of swept-source biometry was evaluated on the basis of 3 measurements captured for each patient. Results One hundred twenty cataract eyes were included in the study. The mean difference between swept-source and PCI biometry for AL, ACD, and SE measurements was 4 μm ± 25 (SD), 17 ± 122 μm, and -0.001 ± 0.19 diopter (D), respectively. The mean difference between swept-source and OLCR biometry for LT and CCT measurements was 21 ± 122 μm and 0.15 ± 4.51 μm, respectively. Differences between swept-source biometry and the other devices distributed around zero without statistical significance. The standard deviation of repeatability for AL, ACD, LT, CCT, and SE was 8.8 μm, 9.8 μm, 2.3 μm, 19.5 μm, and 0.1 D, respectively. Conclusions Swept-source biometry showed high repeatability performance for all biometric parameters. The agreement of AL, ACD, and SE between swept-source and PCI biometry as well as that of LT and CCT between swept-source and OLCR biometry was excellent. It remains to be validated whether high repeatability shown by swept-source biometry will result in better postoperative refractive outcomes. Financial Disclosure Drs.

Methods In this prospective study, 31 eyes from 31 glaucoma patients scheduled for primary trabeculectomy were enrolled. Biometric parameters including axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and lens thickness (LT) were measured using contact ultrasound biometry (UD-6000 Ultrasonic A/B scanner biometer; Tomey Corporation, Nagoya, Japan) and a noncontact optical biometry device (Lenstar; Haag-Streit AG, Koeniz, Switzerland). Measurements were taken the day before trabeculectomy and then compared with measurements obtained 3 and 6 months after surgery. Results The AL and ACD were significantly decreased at 3 and 6 months compared with baseline values taken with each biometry method. There was a significant increase in LT measured by the Lenstar device at the 3-and 6-month follow-up. At both the 3-and 6-month follow-up, the mean AL measurement reduction with the Lenstar device was significantly lower than that of the A-scan ultrasound measurements. The mean ACD changes between the two devices were not significantly different. Conclusions There is a small but significant decrease in the AL and ACD after trabeculectomy as measured with both the contact and noncontact methods. The amount of AL reduction measured is significantly smaller using the noncontact method, making it the preferable method for intraocular lens power calculation for patients who need cataract surgery combined with or after trabeculectomy. The LT measured by the Lenstar device increased significantly after the operation, which can be an early sign of the progression of cataractous changes after trabeculectomy. © 2015 American Academy of Optometry.","anterior chamber depth; axial length; biometry; lens thickness; trabeculectomy","Biometrics; Intraocular lenses; Lenses; Surgery; Ultrasonics; Anterior chamber depth; Baseline values; Biometric parameters; Cataract surgeries; Measurement reduction; Noncontact methods; Prospective study; Ultrasound measurement; Aluminum; adult; aged; anterior eye chamber; biometry; comparative study; eye axis length; female; glaucoma; human; lens; male; middle aged; pathology; pathophysiology; postoperative period; procedures; prospective study; trabecular meshwork; trabeculectomy; young adult; Adult; Aged; Anterior Chamber; Axial Length, Eye; Biometry; Female; Glaucoma; Humans; Lens, Crystalline; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Period; Prospective Studies; Trabecular Meshwork; Trabeculectomy; Young Adult"

Most hospitals and clinics in Israel use growth curves from the United States. Charts developed in different populations do not perform well in the Israeli population.OBJECTIVES: To construct new reference charts for fetal biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC) and femur length (FL), using a large sample of fetuses examined at 14-42 weeks gestational age in a medical center and a community ultrasound unit located in two different regions of Israel.METHODS: Data from the medical center and the community clinic were pooled. The mean and standard error of each measure for each week was calculated. Based on these, reference charts were calculated using quantiles of the normal distribution. The performance of the reference charts was assessed by comparing the new values to empiric quantiles.RESULTS: Biometric measurements were obtained for 79,328 fetuses. Growth charts were established based on these measurements. The overall performance of the curves was very good, with only a few exceptions among the higher quantiles in the third trimester in the medical center subsample.CONCLUSIONS: We present new local reference charts for fetal biometry, derived from a large and minimally selected Israeli population.

Procedure: B-mode US and CT were performed on ten sheep cadaveric eyes. CT biometry involved 100 adult pure-bred dogs with nonocular and nonorbital disease, representing eleven breeds. Eye length, width, and height were each measured in two of three planes (horizontal, sagittal, and equatorial). Results: B-mode US and CT measurements of sheep cadaveric eyes correlated well (0.70-0.71). The shape of the canine eye was found to be akin to an oblate spheroid (a flattened sphere). A reference guide was established for eleven breeds. Eyes of large breed dogs were significantly larger than those of medium and small breed dogs (P < 0.01), and eyes of medium breed dogs were significantly larger than those of small breed dogs (P < 0.01). Eye size correlated with body weight (0.74-0.82) but not gender or skull type. Conclusions: Computed tomography is a suitable method for biometry of the canine eye, and a reference guide was established for eleven breeds. Eye size correlated with breed size and body weight. Because correlation between B-mode US and CT was shown, the obtained values can be applied in the clinical setting, for example, for the diagnosis of microphthalmos and buphthalmos. © 2016 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.","Canine; Computed tomography; Dog breeds; Eye size; Ocular biometry; Ultrasound",

Content: After a brief review of Petit's life and his studies in neurology, anatomy, and cataract surgery, the methodology and results of his work in measuring many of the biometric parameters of the human eye are discussed. Among other techniques, he made use of frozen sections of eyes to explore their dimensions and employed an immersion technique to avoid the effect of corneal refraction on the appearance of the iris. His pioneering biometric results have been largely confirmed by modern studies. Those on the changes in the crystalline lens with age are particularly striking and suggest that these ocular aging effects have changed little over the last 300 years. Although largely forgotten today, his biometric work exercised a considerable influence on his more immediate successors, including Porterfield and Thomas Young. Summary: François Pourfour du Petit deserves to be remembered as an important contributor to our understanding of the structure and dimensions of the human eye. © 2016 The College of Optometrists.","Age; Corneal neutralisation; Crystalline lens; Ocular biometry; Optometric history; Petit",

Methods: The right eyes of 200 healthy subjects and 76 patients with keratoconus were measured with an autorefractometer, a Scheimpflug tomographer, and an optical biometer. The analysis consisted of a general linear model (GLM), correcting for age and gender effects, comparing keratoconic eyes with healthy eyes, and emmetropic eyes. Next, 20 patients with mild keratoconus in one eye and moderate keratoconus in the fellow eye were analyzed to assess the effect of disease stage. Results: As expected the keratoconic group differed significantly from both the healthy and the emmetropic groups for most refractive, corneal, and anterior chamber parameters (GLM, P < 0.001). For the vitreous depth V and the axial length L, the keratoconic group showed significantly larger values than the emmetropic group (V: +0.68 ± 0.19 mm, P = 0.001; L: +0.63 ± 0.14 mm, P < 0.001), but not larger than the healthy group (V: +0.18 ± 0.20 mm, P = 0.364; L: +0.09 ± 0.14 mm, P = 0.519). Besides the corneal parameters, the stage of the disease led to a significantly deeper aqueous depth (+0.07 ± 0.02 mm; Wilcoxon signed rank, P = 0.002), but no significant difference in axial length (P = 0.940). Conclusions: Current analysis does not confirm the previously suggested association between keratoconus and higher amounts of axial myopia, which may have been the result of selection bias by using emmetropic eyes as a healthy control group. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Setting and sample population: The sample consisted of 106 indigenous subjects, in permanent dentition stage, belonging to four groups: Arara-Laranjal (n = 35), Arara-Iriri (n = 20), Xikrin-Kaiapó (n = 24), and Assurini (n = 27). Material and methods: Standardized facial photographs were obtained, and fourteen measurements were analyzed. Intra- and intergroup homogeneities were examined by discriminant analysis, followed by anova and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Sexual dimorphism to each village was analyzed by Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test, at p < 0.05. Results: Significant facial differences were found between male and female, indicating that sex data should not be grouped for intergroup comparison. Discriminant analysis showed a large intergroup heterogeneity, while an intragroup homogeneity was found, especially for females. It was also observed that some morphological features of the face are specific to some villages, regardless of ethnicity. Conclusions: Facial morphological characteristics were strongly different among groups, even comparing villages from the same ethnicity. Furthermore, a low diversity within groups was observed. Our findings, supported by previous reports on genetics and eating habits in these populations, reinforce the role of the genetic determination on craniofacial morphology. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Biometry; Face; Genetics; Indigenous population",

Recently, it was proposed as a promising technology also for biometric applications, i.e., to recognize a subject within a group of known people. For such an application, the accuracy of classical ECG clinical recordings is usually not needed, but the measurement procedure should be fast, robust and cheap. We developed an embedded wearable system for recording one-lead ECG from the wrists of a person. The system was used to record data from 10 subjects. Data were pre-processed to reduce the noise content. Then fiducial points were detected and used to train an ensemble of support vector machines to identify a person among the group. Mean classification accuracy was higher than 95% if a single heartbeat was considered and higher than 98% if 3 consecutive heartbeats were used, choosing by majority. The system is fast (a few seconds are needed), not invasive and can be used either standalone or together with other identification techniques to increase the safety level. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Biometry; Electrocardiogram (ECG); Embedded system; Intelligent sensors; Support vector machine","Artificial intelligence; Electrocardiography; Embedded systems; Biometric applications; Biometry; Clinical application; Ensemble of support vector machines; Identification techniques; Intelligent sensors; Mean classification; Measurement procedures; Support vector machines"

In all animals, corneal anesthesia was achieved by instilling Proparacaine HC1 0.5% directly on the cornea. Ultrasonographic scanning of eyes was done in sternal recumbency with linear transducer (12-18 MHz) by transcorneal approach. Anterior chamber depth was 0.48+0.006 cm, while vitreous depth was 1.74+0.02 cm. Anterio-posterior depth of lens and Latero-medial diameter of lens were 1.05+0.008 cm and 1.92+0.01 cm, respectively. Globe axial length was 3.29+0.03 cm. Camel eye was aspherical and no significant difference was observed in all the parameters of right and left eyes. Before funduscopy, the pupils were dilated with a short-acting mydriatic such as 1 % tropicamide prior to examination. In camels, fundus examination was somewhat cumbersome. The vascular pattern was holangiotic and was similar to other ruminants. Unlike bovines, tapetal non-tapetal differentiation was not clear and sometimes in a single fundus with islands of pigmented and non-pigmented areas could be observed. They usually have a prominent Bergmeister's papilla, which is the posterior remnant of the hyaloid artery.","Biometry; Camel; Eye; Funduscopy; Ultrasonography",

To determine the effect of cycloplegia on corneal thickness, corneal curvature, anterior chamber depth (ACD), angle-to-angle (ATA) and white-to-white (WTW) distances, and axial length (AL). Methods. Changes in corneal thickness, corneal curvature, ACD, ATA and WTW distances, and AL with and without cycloplegia were analyzed in 31 eyes of 31 young myopic adults, aged 26.4 T 3.0 years. Pentacam was used to measure the corneal thickness, corneal volume, and corneal curvatures. Visante optical coherent tomography (OCT) measured corneal thickness, ATA distance, ACD, and pupil size. The AL and WTW distance were measured using IOLMaster. Results. Cycloplegia induced significant flattening of corneal curvatures (p = 0.019, 0.001, and 0.003 for anterior sagittal, posterior tangential, and posterior sagittal curvatures, respectively). The difference in the posterior corneal curvature was greater in corneas with steeper posterior curvatures. Cycloplegia also induced significant deepening of ACD (0.08 T 0.06, p G 0.001) and widening of bothWTW(0.42 T 0.43, p G 0.001) and ATA (0.08 T 0.17, p = 0.015) distances. The cycloplegiarelated increase in the ATA distance correlated negatively with AL (r = j0.361, p = 0.046), whereas the cycloplegia-related increase inWTWdistance correlated weakly with the increase in ACD (r = 0.347, p = 0.056) but not with AL. The AL did not change with cycloplegia. Pentacam measured a slightly thicker cornea than OCT (p = 0.002). Both Pentacam and OCT detected a significant increase in corneal thickness of 4 Km, which could be attributed to reflex tearing, after cycloplegia. Conclusions. Cycloplegia resulted in deeper ACD, greater ATA distance, and flatter corneal curvatures. Surgeons should be aware of these cycloplegia-related alterations for more accurate phakic/functional intraocular lens selection and better refraction results.

Setting Private practice, Lynwood, California, USA. Design Prospective observational study. Methods All measurements were performed with the SS-OCT tomographer, the PCI biometer, and the OLCR biometer. Results Eyes (n = 107) were measured to evaluate the axial length (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT), aqueous depth, anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness, pupil size, corneal diameter, and anterior corneal radius of curvature (RAV). Repeatability and reproducibility of the SS-OCT measurements showed comparable values and a low variation rate, with an interset mean difference of 0.01 mm for AL, 0.01 mm for CCT, 0.01 mm for aqueous depth and ACD, 0.03 mm for lens thickness, 0.10 mm for pupil size, 0.14 mm for corneal diameter, and 0.02 mm for RAV. The SS-OCT device correctly measured the AL in 96% of the cases compared with 79% for the OLCR device and 77% for the PCI device. Comparisons between the PCI device and SS-OCT device were -0.01 ± 0.05 mm for AL, -0.17 ± 0.20 mm for ACD, and -0.01 ± 0.05 mm for RAV. Comparison between the OLCR device and the SS-OCT device was 0.01 ± 0.06 mm for AL, 0.08 ± 0.15 mm for ACD, 0.00 ± 0.05 mm for RAV, 0.00 ± 0.01 mm for CCT, 0.07 ± 0.14 mm for aqueous depth, -0.23 ± 0.22 mm for lens thickness, -0.29 ± 0.53 mm for pupil size, and -0.34 ± 0.76 mm for corneal diameter.

To evaluate their accuracy in the prediction of whelping date and the effect of litter size and foetal sex ratio. METHODS: Foetal biometry parameters were obtained using serial ultrasonographic examinations in eight large (26 to 40 kg) and nine giant (>40 kg) pregnant bitches with known breeding dates and concentrations of serum progesterone during oestrus. The relationship between inner chorionic cavity or biparietal diameter growth and days to parturition were analysed by linear regression and the equations derived from the growth curves were applied to predict the whelping day. The accuracy of the prediction (whelping day ±1 day and ±2 days) and the litter size and sex ratio were recorded. RESULTS: The results showed a significant relationship between days before parturition and inner chorionic cavity or biparietal diameter. The overall accuracy at ±2 days was greater, than that at ±1 day. In giant breed bitches, the accuracy of the prediction by biparietal diameter was significantly lower in small, than normal litter size. No effect of foetal sex ratio was observed.

Our aim was to evaluate whether brain development in late pregnancy can be predicted by fetal brain Doppler, head biometry and the clinical form of CHD at the time of diagnosis. Methods This was a prospective cohort study including 58 fetuses with CHD, diagnosed at 20-24 weeks' gestation, and 58 normal control fetuses. At the time of diagnosis, we recorded fetal head circumference (HC), biparietal diameter, middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (MCA-PI), cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) and brain perfusion by fractional moving blood volume. We classified cases into one of two clinical types defined by the expected levels (high or low) of placental (well-oxygenated) blood perfusion, according to the anatomical defect. All fetuses underwent subsequent 3T-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 36-38 weeks' gestation. Results Abnormal prenatal brain development was defined by a composite score including any of the following findings on MRI: total brain volume &lt; 10th centile, parietoccipital or cingulate fissure depth &lt; 10th centile or abnormal metabolic profile in the frontal lobe. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that MCA-PI (odds ratio (OR), 12.7; P = 0.01), CPR (OR, 8.7; P = 0.02) and HC (OR, 6.2; P = 0.02) were independent predictors of abnormal neurodevelopment; however, the clinical type of CHD was not. Conclusions Fetal brain Doppler and head biometry at the time of CHD diagnosis are independent predictors of abnormal brain development at birth, and could be used in future algorithms to improve counseling and targeted interventions. © Copyright 2015 ISUOG.

However, the biometry and the endogenous and exogenous factors than can limit propagation of this plant are poorly known. Thus, this study aimed to characterize the biometric fruits and seeds of areca palm and to evaluate the seed germination after the dormancy breaking treatments in different substrates. For this, the biometric analysis of length, diameter and weight were recorded; the description of internal and external morphology of fruit and seed were also studied. The treatments to improvement of seed germination were control (T1); immersion of seeds in water a solution of 500 mg L-1 GA3 (T2), mechanical scarification with sandpaper (T3) and combination of mechanical scarification followed of immersion in 500 mg L-1 GA3 (T4). The seeds were sown in containers containing sand, coir dust or vermiculite in all possible combinations. The areca palm fruits and seeds are both, elliptical shape and the weight of fruits and seeds is 1.70 g and 1.04 g, respectively. There is positive correlation between fruit weight and length and diameter of the fruit and just like the diameter has a positive correlation with the diameter of the seed. The mechanical scarification improve the seed germination. The Coir dust is the most appropriate substrate to seed germination of areca palm. The seed germination of Areca palm is hypogeal and the protrusion of the haustorium was observed at 59 days after sowing and the plantlets is fully grown at 153 after sowing.","Areca Palm; Dypsis lutescens; Morphology; Seedling",

Many bird families, including the Rallidae, are characterised by a lack of plumage sexual dimorphism and reduced sexual size dimorphism. In such cases, biometry may still allow the sex of captured birds to be determined. We investigated this possibility in the purple swamphen, a species for which biometric and moult data from southern Europe are scarce. We studied and measured a large sample of wild birds in order: 1) to assess the extent of sexual size dimorphism in adult and immature birds; 2) to determine the period during which plumage characteristics can be reliably used for ageing; and 3) to develop a discriminant function that allows purple swamphens to be sexed using a set of morphometric measurements. Ten biometric traits were measured for 421 wild birds that were also sexed molecularly. We used body and wing photographs from 425 and 232 birds, respectively, in order to classify bird age (adult versus immature, based on the evidence of immature plumage). For most measurements the overall size ranking was as follows: adult males > immature males > adult females > immature females. However, this ranking did not apply to culmen and shield width, because these were bigger in adult females than in immature males. Immature birds moulted gradually during the first winter. The best ageing criterion for immature birds was the presence of median underwingcoverts with whitish tips before the first complete summer moult (second-year birds). This extends the ageing period by another six months relative to prior knowledge. The discriminant analyses using six different biometric traits correctly assigned sex in 88% and 95% of immature and adult birds, respectively. Using only two variables (culmen and body mass) reduced correct sexing to 80%-92%. These equations are a simple and inexpensive way to sex purple swamphens of known or unknown age. Although some caution is necessary, these equations can be useful for sexing birds from other southern European populations.","discriminant function analysis; Ebro delta; moult; rallid; sexual size dimorphism; Spain",

To compare between a new optical biometer (AL-Scan, Nidek Co., Aichi, Japan) and an anterior segment optical coherence tomographer (Visante AS-OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, USA) for measuring central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and aqueous depth (AD). Methods. Sixty-three eyes of 63 normal subjects were examined with AL-Scan and Visante AS-OCT in this prospective study. One eye per subject was measured three times with both devices to record their CCT, ACD, and AD. All procedures were performed by the same operator. Agreement between the two devices was assessed using paired t-tests, Bland-Altman plots, and 95% limits of agreement (LoA). Results. The mean CCT, ACD, and AD measured by AL-Scan were 538.59 ± 27.37 μm, 3.70 ± 0.30 mm, and 3.16 ± 0.30 mm, respectively. The mean values obtained by the Visante OCT were 536.14 ± 26.61 μm for CCT, 3.71 ± 0.29 mm for ACD, and 3.17 ± 0.29 mm for AD. The mean CCT by the AL-Scan was higher than that obtained by the Visante AS-OCT (difference = 2.45 ± 6.07 μm, P < 0.05). The differences in ACD and AD measurements were not statistically significant. The 95% LoA of CCT, ACD, and AD were between -9.44 and 14.35 μm, -0.15 and 0.12 mm, and -0.15 and 0.12 mm, respectively. Conclusions. Since these two devices were comparable for measuring CCT, ACD, and AD, their results can be interchangeably used in the clinic. © 2016 Jinhai Huang et al.",,

Patients and methods: This prospective study was carried out at the Pediatric and urology outpatient and inpatient departments of Cairo University Children's Hospital as well as October 6 University Hospital and it included 155 children between one month and fourteen years old with positive culture UTI. Patients were categorized into APN and LUTI based on their clinical features and laboratory parameters. Thirty healthy children, age and sex matched constituted the control group. Children with positive urine cultures were treated with appropriate antibiotics. Before treatment, urinary IL-6 was measured by enzyme immunoassay technique (ELISA), and renal ultrasound (RUS) was done. CRP (C-reactive protein), IL-6 and RUS were repeated on the 14th day of antibiotic treatment to evaluate the changes in their levels in response to treatment. Results: UIL-6 levels were more significantly higher in patients with APN than in patients with LUTI (24.3±19.3pg/mL for APN vs. 7.3±2.7pg/mL in LUTI (95% CI: 2.6-27.4; p < 0.01). Similarly, serum CRP was more significantly higher in patients with APN than in children with LUTI (19.7±9.1μg/mL vs. 5.5±2.3μg/mL (p < 0.01). IL-6 levels > 20pg/ mL and serum CRP > 20μg/mL were highly reliable markers of APN. Mean renal volume and mean volume difference between the two kidneys in the APN group were more than that of the LUTI and control groups (P < 0.001). Renal volume between 120-130% of normal was the best for differentiating APN from LUTI. Conclusions: RUS and urinary IL-6 levels have a highly dependable role in the differentiation between APN and LUTI especially in places where other investigations are not available and/ or affordable.","Interleukin-6; Lower urinary tract symptoms; Pyelonephritis; Ultrasonography","interleukin 6; adolescent; child; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; echography; female; human; kidney; lower urinary tract symptom; male; organ size; preschool child; prospective study; pyelonephritis; Urinary Tract Infections; urine; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Interleukin-6; Kidney; Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms; Male; Organ Size; Prospective Studies; Pyelonephritis; Ultrasonography; Urinary Tract Infections"

The pods (n=200 fruits) of M. setosissima were collected from plants present in the Cerrado Rupestre of the Serra dos Pirineus State Park, Goiás, Brazil. The fruit were separated into two maturation classes regarding to the color and texture of the pods (brown and green). The pods of each maturity stage were characterized by the following attributes: fresh weight, length, width, thickness, number of seeds, number of normal and abnormal seeds (dead/rotten/damaged/broken). A germination test was used to evaluate the physiological potential of seeds. The germination test applied in a factorial (2 × 2) randomized design, with two fruit ripening stages (brown and green) and two substrates (between paper and paper roll and on paper in a gerbox) (temperature 25°C; 12-hour photoperiod; humidity 75%). The morphobiometrics of M. setosissima fruit depends on the maturity stage, where an increased growth was observed in brown fruits.

In males, a significant decrease in total head length and wing length occurred from April to May, while there was no such trend in females. As individuals of the C. h. tundrae subspecies are generally smaller than birds of the nominate subspecies, this indicates that mainly C. h. tundrae males migrated through the study area in May. A possible explanation of the lack (or very low number) of tundrae females is that the sexes differ in migration strategy, such that one sex may skip some staging areas and make longer flights, leading to an unequal proportion of males and females at some stopover sites. Low body mass indices of males in May and a very low number of retrapped birds suggested that these birds arrived to the study area with low energy reserves and have to use additional stopover sites to reach their breeding areas. © NwjZ, Oradea, Romania, 2016.","Body mass index; Measurements; Migration strategy; Ringed Plover; Spring migration",

There is an extensive literature on the relationship between pregnancy outcomes and the size and shape of the placenta. However, ultrasonic fetal biometry and arterial Doppler flow velocimetry have not previously been studied in relation to postnatal placental morphometry in detail. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of nulliparous women in The Rosie Hospital, Cambridge (UK). We studied a group of 2120 women who had complete data on uterine and umbilical Doppler velocimetry and fetal biometry at 20, 28 and 36 weeks' gestational age, digital images of the placenta available, and delivered a liveborn infant at term. Associations were expressed as the difference in the standard deviation (SD) score of the gestational age adjusted ultrasound measurement (z-score) comparing the lowest and highest decile of the given placental morphometric measurement. Results The lowest decile of placental surface area was associated with 0.87 SD higher uterine artery Doppler mean pulsatility index (PI) at 20 weeks (95% CI: 0.68 to 1.07, P < 0.001). The lowest decile of placental weight was associated with 0.73 SD higher umbilical artery Doppler PI at 36 weeks (95% CI: 0.54 to 0.93, P < 0.001). The lowest decile of both placental weight and placental area were associated with reduced growth velocity of the fetal abdominal circumference between 20 and 36 weeks (both P < 0.001).

To compare a new optical biometer device, Galilei G6 (Ziemer, Port, Switzerland), with the present optical biometer, Lenstar LS 900 (Haag-Streit, Koeniz, Switzerland), for intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation. Methods. One hundred forty eyes of 140 cataract patients were evaluated with two optical biometers: The Galilei G6 and the Lenstar. The mean keratometry (K), axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), crystalline lens thickness (LT), white-To-white (WTW), and IOL powers using the SRK/T, Holladay 1, Hoffer Q, and Haigis formulas were compared. The intrasession repeatability of the Galilei G6 measurements was assessed in 25 eyes. Results. All ocular parameters measured by the Galilei G6 were highly repeatable (all intraclass correlation coefficients 9 0.980). Although K and ACD did not show statistical differences between the two devices (all p 9 0.05), the measurements for AL, LT, and WTW were statistically different for the two devices. The K, AL, ACD, LT, and WTW showed good correlations (r = 0.975, 0.998, 0.973, 0.946, and 0.710, respectively; all p G 0.001); however, the agreements of LT and WTW were not good between the two devices. The IOL powers using four formulas did not show statistical differences (all p 9 0.05); however, agreements between the IOL powers were not strong. The ranges of 95% limit of agreements were between 1.54 and 1.90D according to the formulas. Conclusions. The ocular parameters and IOL powers using the Galilei G6 cannot be used interchangeably with those of the Lenstar in clinical practice.

Methods: The study evaluated 45 eyes with a history of myopic LASIK. Corneal power was measured using manual keratometry, automated keratometry, optical biometry, and Scheimflug tomography. Different hypothetical IOL power calculation formulas were performed for each case. Results: The steepest mean K value was measured with manual keratometry (37.48 ± 2.86 D) followed by automated keratometry (37.31 ± 2.83 D) then optical biometry (37.06 ± 2.98 D) followed by Scheimflug tomography (36.55 ± 3.08). None of the K values generated by Scheimflug tomography were steeper than the measurements from the other 3 instruments. Using equivalent K reading (EKR) 4 mm with the Double-K SRK/T formula, the refractive outcome generated 97.8% of cases within ± 2 D, 80.0% of cases within ± 1 D, and 42.2% of cases within ± 0.5 D. The best combination of formulas was 'Shammas-PL + Double-K SRK/T formula using EKR 4 mm.' Conclusion: Scheimflug tomography imaging using the Holladay EKR 4 mm improved the accuracy of IOL power calculation in post.LASIK eyes. The best option is a combination of formulas.

The aim of this study was to dose the blood concentration of PlGF in women with fetal intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) without associated preeclampsia at the time of diagnosis. Methods.-Case/control study: IUGR was defined by a fetal biometry with abnormal uterine and/or umbilical doppler (n = 23). This group was compared to a control group of fetuses (n = 25) matched for gestational age at blood sampling for the dosage of maternal seric PlGF. Women with preeclampsia were not included. Results.-The plasma PlGF concentration was 11 pg/mL (IQR [11-42,8]) in the IUGR group vs 287 pg/mL [135-439] in the control group (P < 0.001) and this difference was available after adjustment for gestational age at the time of blood sampling (P < 0.001). PlGF sensitivity and specificity for discrimination were respectively 87% (CI 95% [66-97]) and 88% (CI 95% [69-97]).

GA assessment has many diagnostic and therapeutic importance. The methods available for GA estimations are LMP, new Ballard score and each methods has its own drawback which makes them either over estimate or under estimate GA. Antenatal 2nd trimester ultrasound measured femoral length gives more accurate GA estimation. Using similar principles we hypothesized that biometry of long bones with sonography imaging is feasible after birth and may be used to assess GA. The objectives of this study were to assess Post-natal gestational age using sonographic measurement of femoral length and then compare values with antenatal standards and further comparison of validity of each value with gestational age assessment by new Ballard score and the GA by LMP. Material and Methods: Ninety neonates from 32 weeks to 40 weeks of GA according to accurate LMP were subjected ultrasonographic measurement of femoral length. Results: GA calculated using accurate LMP as standard and compared with GA calculated from New Ballard score over estimated the GA. Post natal femoral length measured using sonographic method showed increase in femoral length with increasing GA similar to antenatal femoral standard and showed no statistical difference (p-value 0.375). Conclusions: post natal femoral length measured by ultrasonographicaly is a safe, feasible, objective and fastest method of GA estimation. © 2016, Nepal Paediatric Society (NEPAS).

Thirty-eight consecutive high-hyperopic subjects (75 eyes) with axial lengths <20.5 mm underwent uniform comprehensive ocular evaluation. Twenty-five subjects were diagnosed as PM and 13 as NO based on the horizontal corneal diameter. Parameters analysed included visual acuity, refraction, horizontal corneal diameter, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, axial length, fundus changes, and associated ocular pathology. Primary outcome measures: ocular biometry difference between PM and NO. Secondary outcome measures: differences in associated ocular pathologies between PM and NO.ResultsHyperopia ranged from +7 to +17 D and was similar in the two groups. Lens thickness was statistically more in NO than in PM group (4.53±0.75 mm vs 3.82±0.48 mm, P <0.001), whereas anterior chamber depth was more in the PM than in NO group (3.26±0.36 mm, vs 2.59±0.37 mm, P<0.001).

Using third-generation intraocular lens (IOL) formulas, without adjustments, hyperopic refractive outcomes are common. We discuss these issues, focusing on the various lens formulas and transformations that have improved postoperative accuracy. Recent findings Axial length measurement error has been largely overcome by the use of optical interferometry. Despite this, consistent hyperopic errors are still reported. We reviewed the postoperative refraction results compared with the predicted refractions using: standard formulas (Holladay 1, SRK/T, Hoffer Q, and Haigis) with manufacturers' optical lens constants, the User Group for Laser Interference Biometry (ULIB) constants, manufacturers' constants with axial length adjustment method, and fourth-generation IOL formulas (Barrett Universal II, Holladay 2, and Olsen). Summary Improved predictive results is obtained with the Barrett Universal II (software constants), Haigis (ULIB), SRK/ T, Holladay 2 (software constants), and Olsen (software constants) formulas in eyes with axial lengths greater than 26.0mm and IOL powers greater than 6.0 D. In eyes with axial lengths greater than 26.0mm and IOL less than 6.0 D, the Barrett Universal II formula (software constants) and the Haigis (axial length adjusted) and Holladay 1 formulas (axial length-Adjusted) should be used.

Methods A prospective cross-sectional study between September 2009 and December 2014 was carried out at ALTAMEDICA Fetalâ€""Maternal Medical Centre, Rome, Italy. Of 25203 fetal biometric measurements, 12167 (48%) measurements of the cerebellar vermis were available. After excluding 1562 (12.8%) measurements, a total of 10605 (87.2%) fetuses were considered and analyzed once only. Parametric and nonparametric quantile regression models were used for the statistical analysis. In order to evaluate the robustness of the proposed reference charts regarding various distributional assumptions on the ultrasound measurements at hand, we compared the gestational age-specific reference curves we produced through the statistical methods used. Normal mean height based on parametric and nonparametric methods were defined for each week of gestation and the regression equation expressing the height of the cerebellar vermis as a function of gestational age was calculated. Finally the correlation between dimension/gestation was measured. Results The mean height of the cerebellar vermis was 12.7mm (SD, 1.6mm; 95% confidence interval, 12.7â€""12.8mm). The regression equation expressing the height of the CV as a function of the gestational age was: height (mm) = -4.85+0.78 x gestational age. The correlation between dimension/gestation was expressed by the coefficient r = 0.87. Conclusion This is the first prospective cross-sectional study on fetal cerebellar vermis biometry with such a large sample size reported in literature. It is a detailed statistical survey and contains new centile-based reference charts for fetal height of cerebellar vermis measurements. © 2016 Cignini et al.

Design Prospective observational clinical study. Methods Sixteen investigator-derived, 4 standard Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA), and geometric variables from corneal tomography and optical biometry using Oculus Pentacam and IOL Master were assessed for discriminative value in Marfan syndrome, measuring right eyes of 24 control and 13 Marfan syndrome subjects. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Six investigator-derived ORA variables successfully discriminated Marfan syndrome. The best lone disease predictor was Concavity Min (Marfan syndrome 47.5 ± 20, control 69 ± 14, P =.003; AUROC = 0.80). Corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) were decreased (Marfan syndrome CH 9.45 ± 1.62, control CH 11.24 ± 1.21, P =.01; Marfan syndrome CRF 9.77 ± 1.65, control CRF 11.03 ± 1.72, P =.01) and corneas were flatter in Marfan syndrome (Marfan syndrome Kmean 41.25 ± 2.09 diopter, control Kmean 42.70 ± 1.81 diopter, P =.046). No significant differences were observed in central corneal thickness, axial eye length, or intraocular pressure. A multivariate regression model incorporating corneal curvature and hysteresis loop area (HLA) provided the best predictive value for Marfan syndrome (AUROC = 0.85). Conclusions This study describes novel biodynamic features of corneal deformation responses in Marfan syndrome, including increased deformation, decreased bending resistance, and decreased energy dissipation capacity.

Methods Maternal characteristics, fetal biometry and second-trimester uterine artery (UtA) Doppler were included in logistic regression analysis to estimate risk for late FGR (birth weight &lt; 3rd percentile, or 3rd-10th percentile plus abnormal cerebroplacental ratio or UtA Doppler, with delivery ≥ 34 weeks). Based on the second-trimester risk, strategies for performing contingent third-trimester ultrasound examinations in 10%, 25% or 50% of the cohort were tested against a strategy of routine ultrasound scanning in the entire population at 32 + 0 to 33 + 6 weeks. Results Models were constructed based on 1393 patients and validated in 1303 patients, including 73 (5.2%) and 82 late FGR (6.3%) cases, respectively. At the second-trimester scan, the a-posteriori second-trimester risk (a-posteriori first-trimester risk (baseline a-priori risk and mean arterial blood pressure) combined with second-trimester abdominal circumference and UtA Doppler) yielded an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.74-0.87) (detection rate (DR), 43.1% for a 10% false-positive rate (FPR)). The combination of a-posteriori second-trimester risk plus third-trimester estimated fetal weight (full model) yielded an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.96) (DR, 74% for a 10% FPR). Subjecting 10%, 25% or 50% of the study population to third-trimester ultrasound, based on a-posteriori second-trimester risk, gave AUCs of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.75-0.88), 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78-0.91) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94), respectively. Only the 50% contingent model proved statistically equivalent to performing routine third-trimester ultrasound scans (AUC, 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.96), P = 0.11).

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Participants 6 to 7 years old students, 167 cases of eye data (of the right eye). Methods: 167 cases of children were measured twice (2011, 2014) in three years for ocular biometry and refractive error. According to myopia occurrence time, children were divided into non-myopia group (both 2011 and 2014 check did not show myopia), new myopia group (those showed myopia in 2014 but no myopia in 2011), and myopia group (myopia was noted both in 2011 and 2014). Paired sample t test was used to compare refractive parameters changes from 2011 to 2014. The comparison between groups was done with analysis of variance (ANOVA). Main Outcome Measures: Spherical equivalence (SE), axial length (AL), corneal radius (CR), central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT) and axial length/corneal radius of curvature ratio (AL/CR).

Negative binomial models are a straightforward and readily motivated generalization for the case of overdispersed data, that is, when the observed variance is greater than expected under a Poissonian model. Rate and overdispersion parameters then need to be considered jointly, which in general is not trivial. Here, we are concerned with evidence synthesis in the case where the reporting of data is rather heterogeneous, that is, events are reported either in terms of mean event counts, the proportion of event-free patients, or rate estimates and standard errors. Either figure carries some information about the relevant parameters, and it is the joint modeling that allows for coherent inference on the parameters of interest.

Methods One hundred and twenty-six eyes of 126 patients were included. There were 30 healthy (Group 1), 28 glaucoma suspect (Group 2), 48 early glaucoma (Group 3), and 20 advanced glaucoma cases (Group 4). After complete ophthalmic examination, Humphrey visual field analysis and mfERG were performed. These examinations were performed three times at 6-month intervals, and only the last examination results were used for the analysis. Visual fields global indices and mfERG implicit time and amplitudes were evaluated and analyzed by ring system (central 5°, 5°–10°, 10°–15° and >15°). One-way ANOVA and ROC curve analysis were used for statistical analysis. Results There was no statistically (one-way ANOVA) significant differences in patient age between groups (p = 0.126). For all rings, we detected statistically significant differences for the mean implicit time (latency) of the N1, P1, and N2 components between the advanced glaucoma and control subjects and between the advanced glaucoma and glaucoma suspects. The N2 amplitudes were significantly decreased in all rings in the advanced glaucoma patients when compared with control subjects. The N2 amplitude was significantly different between healthy subjects (Group 1) and early glaucoma subjects (Group 3) in the central 2° and 2°–5° rings. We used MedClac ROC curve analysis to identify the best parameters for discriminating between control subjects (Group 1) and early glaucoma patients (Group 3). The N2 implicit time for the central 2° ring (p < 0.0001), N2 amplitude for the central 2° ring (p = 0.0001), P1 implicit time for the 2°–5° ring (p = 0.0001), N2 implicit time for the 2°–5° ring (p = 0.0003), and N2 amplitude for the 2°–5° ring (p = 0.001) had ≥0.7 AUC values and were the best parameters in the ROC curve analyses that included the VFA parameters Conclusion Alterations of amplitudes and implicit times of N2 response in the central area may be able to detect glaucoma earlier than VFA. In addition, with progression to advanced glaucoma these changes can be significant in all retinal areas. Although implicit times of all mfERG components are significantly delayed in glaucoma, both delayed implicit time and decreased amplitude of N2 wave in the central area are effective predictors in early glaucoma diagnosis. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.","Amplitude; Glaucoma; Humphrey perimetry; Implicit time; Latency; Multifocal electroretinography; N2 wave; Photopic negative response; Ring analysis","adult; aged; biometry; electroretinography; female; glaucoma; human; male; middle aged; Ocular Hypertension; pathophysiology; perimetry; physiology; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; retina; visual acuity; visual field; Adult; Aged; Biometry; Electroretinography; Female; Glaucoma; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ocular Hypertension; Retina; ROC Curve; Visual Acuity; Visual Field Tests; Visual Fields"

Trachinocephalus gauguini n. sp. is described from the Marquesas Islands and is distinguished from the two other species in the genus by having a shorter snout, a narrower interorbital space, larger eye and modally fewer anal-fin and pectoral-fin rays. The distribution of Trachinocephalus myops (type species) is restricted to the Atlantic Ocean and the name Trachinocephalus trachinus is resurrected for populations from the Indo-West Pacific Ocean. Principal component analyses and bivariate plots based on the morphometric data differentiated T. gauguini from the other two species, but a substantial overlap between T. myops and T. trachinus exists. Phylogenetic evidence based on mtDNA COI sequences unambiguously supports the recognition of at least three species in Trachinocephalus, revealing deep divergences between the Atlantic Ocean, Indo-West Pacific Ocean and Marquesas entities. Additional analyses of species delimitations using the generalized mixed Yule coalescent model and the Poisson tree processes model provide a more liberal assessment of species in Trachinocephalus, indicating that many more cryptic species may exist. Finally, a taxonomic key to identify the three species recognized here is provided. © 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","Atlantic Ocean; Marquesas Islands; Pacific Ocean; T. gauguini; T. myops; T. trachinus","mitochondrial DNA; anatomy and histology; animal; Atlantic Ocean; biometry; classification; fish; genetics; island (geological); Pacific Ocean; phylogeny; pigmentation; Polynesia; principal component analysis; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Biometry; DNA, Mitochondrial; Fishes; Islands; Pacific Ocean; Phylogeny; Pigmentation; Polynesia; Principal Component Analysis"

The Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) generally commissions the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) with this type of assessment, which examines whether a new drug shows an added benefit (a positive patient-relevant treatment effect) over the current standard therapy. IQWiG is required to assess the extent of added benefit on the basis of a dossier submitted by the pharmaceutical company responsible. In this context, IQWiG was faced with the task of developing a transparent and plausible approach for operationalizing how to determine the extent of added benefit. In the case of an added benefit, the law specifies three main extent categories (minor, considerable, major). To restrict value judgements to a minimum in the first stage of the assessment process, an explicit and abstract operationalization was needed. The present paper is limited to the situation of binary data (analysis of 2 × 2 tables), using the relative risk as an effect measure. For the treatment effect to be classified as a minor, considerable, or major added benefit, the methodological approach stipulates that the (two-sided) 95% confidence interval of the effect must exceed a specified distance to the zero effect. In summary, we assume that our approach provides a robust, transparent, and thus predictable foundation to determine minor, considerable, and major treatment effects on binary outcomes in the early benefit assessment of new drugs in Germany. After a decision on the added benefit of a new drug by G-BA, the classification of added benefit is used to inform pricing negotiations between the umbrella organization of statutory health insurance and the pharmaceutical companies. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The aim of this study was to define the geometry of the thumb metacarpal in order to help create a standardized set of transcutaneous osseointegrated prostheses to treat patients who have suffered amputation of the thumb at the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint. Materials and methods: A total of 80 metacarpals from 46 cadavers were studied. All soft tissues were removed and the thumb metacarpals were imaged using computed tomography. Three-dimensional models were constructed using images from the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes. Using HyperMesh™ CAD software, the bones were analyzed for overall length, radius of curvature, medullary canal diameter, cortical thickness, and distance to the isthmus, defined as the narrowest portion of the intramedullary canal. Results: The average length of the first metacarpal was 47.6 mm (±3.3 mm, 39.2–56.9 mm). The average radius of curvature was 55.5 mm (±10.7 mm, 33–78.9 mm). Inner bone diameter, measured in two axes, was 10.5 mm (±1.3 mm, 5.4–18.7 mm) for the major axis and 7.7 mm (±0.9 mm, 4.3–17.8 mm) for the minor axis. The average cortical thickness was 1.4 mm (±0.3 mm, 0.7–3.1 mm). The distance to the center of the isthmus from the distal end had an average length of 21.3 mm (±1.9 mm, 17–25 mm). Conclusions: Using these findings a standardized set of intramedullary stems can be developed as a base for a transcutaneous osseointegrated prosthesis, helping to create a reliable method for treating patients with amputated thumbs. © 2015, Springer-Verlag France.","Amputation; Amputees; Biometry; Hand; Porosity; Prostheses and implants; Quality of life","adult; aged; amputation; Article; bone prosthesis; bone regeneration; cadaver; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; cortical thickness (bone); female; human; human tissue; imaging software; male; metacarpal bone; metacarpophalangeal joint; morphometrics; priority journal; radius; soft tissue; thumb; anatomical variation; anatomy and histology; anthropometry; metacarpal bone; middle aged; prosthesis design; thumb; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anatomic Variation; Anthropometry; Female; Humans; Male; Metacarpal Bones; Middle Aged; Prosthesis Design; Thumb"

In this paper we exhaustively analyze the recognition performance achievable when using a parsimonious representation, in the frequency domain, of EEG signals acquired in both eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting conditions. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of EEG templates obtained as projections onto subspaces defined through eigenbrains (EBs) or eigentensorbrains (ETBs), two bases for EEG signals here defined by means of principal component analysis (PCA) and multilinear PCA (MPCA). An extensive set of experimental tests, conducted on a database comprising EEG recordings acquired from 30 subjects during two separate sessions, in different days, is performed to compare the recognition capabilities of the considered representations under different system configurations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Biometrics; Brain waves; EEG; MPCA; PCA; Tensor analysis","Biometrics; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Frequency domain analysis; Principal component analysis; Biometric recognition; Brain wave; Continuous identification; Liveness detection; MPCA; PCA; System configurations; Tensor analysis; Biomedical signal processing; Article; biometry; brain electrophysiology; controlled study; data analysis; data base; data processing; eigenbrain; eigentensorbrain; electroencephalography; human; human experiment; multilinear principal component analysis; principal component analysis; priority journal; signal processing"

A surrogate endpoint is expected to predict clinical benefit, harm, or lack of these. Besides the biological plausibility of a surrogate, a quantitative assessment of the strength of evidence for surrogacy requires the demonstration of the prognostic value of the surrogate for the clinical outcome, and evidence that treatment effects on the surrogate reliably predict treatment effects on the clinical outcome. We focus on these two conditions, and outline the statistical approaches that have been proposed to assess the extent to which these conditions are fulfilled. When data are available from a single trial, one can assess the ""individual level association"" between the surrogate and the true endpoint. When data are available from several trials, one can additionally assess the ""trial level association"" between the treatment effect on the surrogate and the treatment effect on the true endpoint. In the latter case, the ""surrogate threshold effect"" can be estimated as the minimum effect on the surrogate endpoint that predicts a statistically significant effect on the clinical endpoint. All these concepts are discussed in the context of randomized clinical trials in oncology, and illustrated with two meta-analyses in gastric cancer. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Setting Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, United Kingdom. Design Prospective case series. Methods This study comprised patients having laser cataract surgery with concurrent astigmatism management by intrastromal AK. All eyes had greater than 0.7 corneal diopter (D) cylinder. An intrastromal AK nomogram with 8.0 mm diameter paired symmetric limbal centered arcs was used. Corneal keratometry was measured preoperatively and 1 month postoperatively using a KR8100PA topographer-autorefractor. Astigmatic analyses were performed using the Alpins method considering 3 vectors - target induced astigmatism (TIA), surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) and difference vector (DV) - and calculation of coupling measures. Results In all, 196 eyes of 133 patients were analyzed. The mean TIA (equivalent to preoperative corneal cylinder) was 1.21 D ± 0.42 (SD) (range 0.75 to 2.64 D) and the mean SIA was 0.74 DC ± 0.40 (range 0.00 to 2.86). The mean difference vector was 0.74 ± 0.38 D (range 0.00 to 2.25 D). The mean correction index was 0.63 ± 0.32 (range 0.00 to 1.93), indicating that the mean astigmatism correction was 63%. Fourteen eyes (7.1%) and 7 eyes (3.6%) had an astigmatism correction of greater than 100% and greater than 120%, respectively. Overall 0%, 48.5%, and 51.5% of eyes had 0.50 D or less, 1.0 D or less, or greater than 1.0 D, respectively, preoperatively compared with 32.1%, 85.7%, and 14.3%, postoperatively. There were no cases of corneal endothelial perforation or inadvertent placement within the visual axis. Conclusions The intrastromal AKs were easily programmed as an integral part of laser-assisted cataract surgery without additional cost, significantly reduced corneal cylinder, and appeared to be safe through 1 month of follow-up.

The sperm formed before the beginning of the spawning period may be stored for a long time, causing damage to the cells. Therefore, re-stripping may be an important way to eliminate the ""old"" and allow for the collection of ""new"" spermatozoids. In this study, we analyzed the seminal characteristics of hormonally induced pacu at the beginning, middle and end of the breeding season, and we analyzed samples from re-stripped males (stripped first at the beginning, re-stripped in the middle, and re-stripped again at the end of the season) during two breeding seasons. The sperm density, ionic composition, pH, and osmolality were similar among the groups. The semen volume, seminal plasma protein concentration and incidence of morphologically anomalous sperm increased over time. In addition, some parameters that are associated with good-quality semen decreased, such as sperm motility, viability and DNA integrity. Moreover, we observed a positive association among motility, viability and DNA integrity for sperm with elevated 11-ketotestosterone, but there was no such association for fshb or lhb mRNA levels in the pituitary. The semen that was obtained earlier (at the beginning) or from re-stripped males exhibited better characteristics than the other samples collected. In conclusion, collecting semen from pacu at the end of breeding season should be avoided; it is preferable to strip early and then re-strip later in the season, and this approach may be used for diverse aquaculture purposes. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","DNA damage; Gonadotropins mRNA levels; Neotropical teleost fish; Semen quality; Spermiation; Steroid hormones","sex hormone; 11-ketotestosterone; testosterone; animal experiment; animal tissue; aquaculture; Article; biometry; breeding; cell viability; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA synthesis; hormone determination; male; male genital system; molecular cloning; morphology; morphometrics; nonhuman; osmolality; osmolarity; pH; physical chemistry; Piaractus mesopotamicus; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; RNA extraction; semen analysis; sequence alignment; spermatogenesis; spermatozoon; spermatozoon density; spermatozoon motility; teleost; analogs and derivatives; animal; breeding; Characiformes; metabolism; physiology; season; sperm; spermatozoon; spermatozoon count; Animals; Breeding; Characiformes; Male; Osmolar Concentration; Seasons; Semen; Semen Analysis; Sperm Count; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa; Testosterone"

Objectives To compare the accuracy of antenatal two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound, three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in predicting fetal macrosomia at birth. Search strategy Medline (1966-2013), Embase, the Cochrane Library and Web of Knowledge. Selection criteria Cohort or diagnostic accuracy studies of women with a singleton pregnancy, who had third-trimester imaging to predict macrosomia (>4000 g, >4500 g or >90th or >95th centile). Data collection and analysis Two reviewers screened studies, performed data extraction and assessed methodological quality. The bivariate model was used to obtain summary sensitivities, specificities and likelihood ratios. Main results Fifty-eight studies (34 367 pregnant women) were included. Most were poorly reported. Only one study assessed 3D ultrasound volumetry. For predicting birthweight >4000 g or >90th centile, the summary sensitivity for 2D ultrasound (Hadlock) estimated fetal weight (EFW) >90th centile or >4000 g (29 studies) was 0.56 (95% CI 0.49-0.61), 2D ultrasound abdominal circumference (AC) >35 cm (four studies) was 0.80 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.69-0.87) and MRI EFW (three studies) was 0.93 (95% CI 0.76-0.98). The summary specificities were 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94), 0.86 (95% CI 0.74-0.93) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.92-0.97), respectively. Conclusion There is insufficient evidence to conclude that MRI EFW is more sensitive than 2D ultrasound AC (which is more sensitive than 2D EFW); although it was more specific. Further primary research is required before recommending MRI EFW for use in clinical practice. Tweetable abstract Systematic review of antenatal imaging to predict macrosomia.

Setting Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China. Design Prospective observational cross-sectional study. Methods For a comprehensive comparison between the partial coherence interferometry (PCI) device and the optical low-coherence reflectometry (OLCR) device, the axial length (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), aqueous depth, mean keratometry (K), astigmatism, white-to-white (WTW), and pupil diameter were measured 3 times per device in eyes with cataract. The sequence of the device was in random order. The mean values were compared and 95% limits of agreement (LoA) were assessed. Results Ninety-two eyes of 92 cataract patients were included. Bland-Altman analysis showed excellent agreement between the PCI device and the OLCR device for AL, CCT, ACD and aqueous depth measurements with narrow 95% LoA (-0.05 to 0.06 mm, -13.39 to 15.61 μm, -0.11 to 0.10 mm, and -0.12 to 0.10 mm, respectively), and the P values were more than 0.05. The mean K, astigmatism, and WTW values provided by the PCI device were in good agreement with the OLCR device, although statistically significant differences were detected. A major difference was observed in the pupil diameter measurement, with a 95% LoA of -0.73 to 1.21 mm. Conclusions The PCI device biometer provided ocular measurements similar to those provided by the OLCR device for most parameters, especially for AL, CCT, and ACD. The pupil diameter values obtained with the PCI device were in poor agreement with the OLCR device, and these measurements should be interpreted with necessary adjustment.

Design Interinstrument reliability and bias assessment study. Methods A total of 107 eyes from 56 patients assessed for ICL implantation at our institution were included in the study. This was a consecutive series of all patients with suitable available data. The agreement and bias between WTW (measured with the Pentacam and BioGraph devices) and STS (measured with the HiScan device) were estimated. Results The mean spherical equivalent was -8.93 ± 5.69 diopters. The BioGraph measures of WTW were wider than those taken with the Pentacam (bias = 0.26 mm, P <.01), and both horizontal WTW measures were wider than the horizontal STS measures (bias >0.91 mm, P <.01). The repeatability (Sr) of STS measured with the HiScan was 0.39 mm, which was significantly reduced (Sr = 0.15 mm) when the average of 2 measures was used. Agreement between the horizontal WTW measures and horizontal STS estimates when bias was accounted for was Cyrillic small letter GHE = 0.54 with the Pentacam and Cyrillic small letter GHE = 0.64 with the BioGraph. Conclusions Large interdevice bias was observed for WTW and STS measures. STS measures demonstrated poor repeatability, but the average of repeated measures significantly improved repeatability.

For this study, gamonts/schizonts and agamonts of the species Heterostegina depressa d'Orbigny were examined by μCT; each single chamber's volume was digitally measured. This approach enables cell growth to be recognised in terms of chamber volume sequence, which progressively increases until reproduction occurs. This sequence represents the ontogeny of the foraminiferal cell and has been used here to investigate controlling factors potentially affecting the process of chamber formation. This is manifested as instantaneous or periodic deviations of the realised chamber volumes derived from modelled growth functions. The results obtained on naturally grown specimens show oscillations in chamber volumes which can be modelled by sums of sinusoidal functions. A set of functions with similar periods in all investigated specimens points to lunar and tidal cycles.To determine whether such cyclic signals are genuine and not the effects of a theoretical model, the same analysis was conducted on specimens held in a closed laboratory facility, as they should not be affected by natural environmental effects. Surprisingly, similar cyclicities were observed in such samples. However, a solely genetic origin of these cycles couldn't be verified either. Therefore, detailed analysis on the phase equality of these growth oscillations have been done. This approach is pivotal for proving that the oscillatory patterns discovered in LBF are indeed genuine signals, and on how chamber growth might be influenced by tidal currents or lunar months. © 2015 The Authors.","Biological oscillators; Biometry; Cyclicity; Larger benthic foraminifera; Tomography","Foraminifera; Heterostegina depressa"

However, measurements can be imprecise, and skins tend to shrink when they dry — two problems rarely investigated for petrels (family: Procellariidae). This study examined measurement error and shrinkage for 15 biometrics, using Short-tailed Shearwater Puffinus tenuirostris as the subject species. Random measurement error, defined as the variability of repeated measurements of a particular character taken on the same individual relative to its variability among individuals in a particular group, ranged from 0.3% for head plus bill length in dry specimens to 36% for tarsus width in freshly dead birds. Shrinkage of skin specimens stabilised within 2-5 months after preparation. Average fresh-dry shrinkage ranged from 0.2% for head plus bill to 12% for tarsus height. A new method was used to estimate shrinkage variability among individuals. “Shrinkage variation,” defined as the proportion of unexplained variance (1 - r2) in the correlation between paired fresh and dry measurements of a particular character after correcting for measurement error, ranged from 0% for wing chord to 33% for bill base width.

This study examines the accuracy of neophyte clinicians' assessments of central corneal clearance (CCC) of a corneoscleral lens using lens center thickness (CT) as a biometric scale. Methods. A normal participant was fit with a corneoscleral lens on both eyes. Observers (n = 34) from the final semester of their fourth year in optometric clinical training were instructed to estimate the amount of CCC through the approximate geometrical center of the lens using a standardized script which included a photograph identifying various zones. Observer estimates were then compared against anterior segment-OCT (AS-OCT) values obtained during calibration. Results. Mean observer estimates of central corneal clearances were OD 220.5 Â± 121.microns (range 50 to 480 microns) and OS 398.0 Â± 159.1 microns (range 140 to 800 microns). The mean AS-OCT values were OD 105.5 T 11.microns (range 84 to 121 microns) and OS 340.8 Â± 15.2 microns (range 315 to 362 microns). Mann-Whitney test was statistically significant for comparison of median values OD (177.0; p = 0.001) and OS (260.0; p = 0.012). Conclusions. Neophyte clinicians in the final semester of their fourth year of optometric clinical training tend to significantly overestimate the amount of CCC in a normal subject with declining accuracy as the amount of clearance diminishes.

However, acquiring standardised head, abdominal and femoral image planes is challenging due to variable image quality. There remains a significant discrepancy between the way automated computer vision algorithms and human sonographers perform this task; this paper contributes to the attempt to bridge this gap by building knowledge of US image perception into a pipeline for classifying images obtained during 2-D fetal US scans. We record the eye movements of 10 participants performing 4 2-D US scans each, on a phantom fetal model at varying orientations. We analyse their eye movements to establish which high-level constraints and visual cues are used to localise the standardised abdominal plane. We then build a vocabulary of visual words trained on SURF descriptors extracted around eye fixations, and use the resulting bag of words model to classify head, abdominal and femoral image frames acquired during 10 clinical US scans and 10 further phantom US scans. On phantom data, we achieve classification accuracies of 89%, 87% and 85% for the head, abdominal and femoral images respectively. On clinical data, we achieve classification accuracies of 76%, 68% and 64% for the head, abdominal and femoral images respectively. This constitutes the first insight into image perception during real time US scanning, and a proof of concept for training bag of words models for US image analysis on human eye movements. © 2016 The Authors.

Four dermatology physicians were recruited to examine RPPVSM from 75 skin images collected from a total of 51 Caucasian and Asian subjects. The images were separated into 50 reference (""suspect"") images and 25 evaluation (""evidence"") images. The examiners were asked to perform identification by annotating RPPVSM in each of the 25 evaluation images and matching them with the reference images. The rate of misidentification was 0% while the mean rate at which examiners failed to find a match was 6%, indicating the potential of dermatology physicians performing the role of RPPVSM examiners. © 2016 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.","Biometrics; Body geometry; Digital evidence; Forensic science; Identification; Interexaminer variability; Skin mark","adult; Asian continental ancestry group; biometry; Caucasian; female; forensic medicine; human; male; middle aged; observer variation; pathology; pilot study; procedures; reproducibility; skin disease; skin pigmentation; young adult; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biometric Identification; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Pilot Projects; Reproducibility of Results; Skin Diseases; Skin Pigmentation; Young Adult"

Design Prospective, cross-sectional study. Methods participants: Ninety-one eyes from 91 patients with glaucomatous optic neuropathy were prospectively tested with a 10-2 VF test. observation procedures: Glaucoma patients were classified into eyes with or without parafoveal scotoma on 10-2 VF based on pattern deviation plot. The central 10 degree region of Humphrey 24-2 VF test comprised 12 points and any abnormal VF points depressed <5%, <2%, <1%, or <0.5% from the normal database on pattern deviation plot were analyzed. Various factors related to the presence of parafoveal scotoma on 10-2 VF were analyzed. main outcome measures: Abnormal 24-2 VF points, macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness. Results The presence of abnormal 24-2 VF points <0.5% was significantly different between eyes with and without parafoveal scotoma on 10-2 VF (P <.01). The minimum macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness (P =.04), any central 12 points depressed <0.5% on 24-2 VF (P <.01), and any central 12 points depressed <5% on 24-2 VF that spatially corresponds to macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thinning (P < 0.01) were related factors to the presence of parafoveal scotoma on 10-2 VF. Conclusions Glaucomatous eyes with any abnormal 24-2 VF points on the central 10 degree region that are depressed <0.5% or <5% that correlates to macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thinning should receive attention and be further evaluated with a 10-2 VF test. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,"adult; Article; biometry; biomicroscopy; central corneal thickness; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; cross-sectional study; eye photography; female; fundus camera; glaucomatous optic neuropathy; Goldmann applanation tonometer; gonioscopy; human; Humphrey 10 2 Visual Field test; Humphrey 24 2 Visual Field test; Humphrey perimeter; major clinical study; male; optical coherence tomography device; outcome assessment; pachymeter; pachymetry; parafoveal scotoma; partial coherence interferometry biometer; perimetry; priority journal; prospective study; retina fovea; retina ganglion cell; retina inner plexiform layer; retinal nerve fiber layer thickness; scotoma; slit lamp; ultrasound pachymetry; visual field; aged; glaucoma; intraocular pressure; middle aged; nerve fiber; oculoplethysmography; Optic Nerve Diseases; optical coherence tomography; pathology; pathophysiology; perimetry; physiology; procedures; retina fovea; scotoma; visual acuity; visual field; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fovea Centralis; Glaucoma; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Fibers; Optic Nerve Diseases; Prospective Studies; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Scotoma; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Tonometry, Ocular; Visual Acuity; Visual Field Tests; Visual Fields"

The feasibility of transrectal ultrasonography of the adrenal glands was tested on 30 healthy donkeys using a 10 MHz linear-array transducer. Mean age of animals was 10.7±4.8 years, mean body weight 275.0±62.9 kg and mean height 126.7±7.1 cm. The left adrenal gland was visualized in all donkeys. The right gland ultrasonography was not feasible in seven animals with a height less than 116 cm. The left gland was visualized as a linear or slightly curved structure, the right gland was most often Sshaped. In both glands, a hypochoic peripheral zone was identified as the cortex with an inner, hyperechoic medulla. The length was 5.49±1.90 and 5.15±1.10 cm for right and left gland, respectively. Right gland whole and medullary thickness was 0.71±0.11 and 0.24±0.09 cm, 0.65±0.13 and 0.21±0.07 cm, 0.56±0.17 and 0.25±0.07 cm for cranial pole, middle point and caudal pole respectively. Left gland whole and medullary thickness values were 0.69±0.13 and 0.25±0.09 cm, 0.66±0.13 and 0.23±0.09 cm, 0.57±0.15 and 0.26±0.09 cm for cranial pole, middle point and caudal pole, respectively. There was a significant correlation between height and the entire length of the left gland.

We increased locomotion costs for a whole year by equipping male great tits with a backpack during breeding, removing the backpacks 1 year later. We applied 3 different treatments: control (without backpack), light (""empty"" backpack, 0.1g), and heavy (""full"" backpack, 0.9g, ~5% of body mass). Backpacks were administered in 3 cohorts, and we monitored effects on mass of nestlings and the male, wing length, reproduction, and survival. Added mass had a negative effect on nestling mass in both the starting year of the experiment and 1 year later, but not on production of fledglings or recruits. In winter and the next breeding season, males equipped with heavy backpacks had a higher (net) body mass and had shorter third primary feathers than the other 2 groups. Heavy backpack males were less likely to sleep in a nest box in winter. Nest boxes are optimal roosting sites, and we interpret this finding as a treatment effect on success in competition over this resource. However, there was no effect of the manipulation on survival. Overall, we found no long-term fitness consequences, and we discuss possible explanations and implications for the ""starvation-predation theory"" of optimal body mass. However, we found short-term effects of carrying extra weight suggesting that behavioral studies using small devices should consider the effects of equipping small non-migratory passerines with devices such as transmitters. © 2016 The Author.","Avian; biometry; mortality; reproduction; workload","biometry; body mass; breeding; breeding site; fitness; locomotion; mortality; nest box; nestling; reproductive cost; songbird; survival; trade-off; Aves; Passeri"

The combination of our seven auxiliary matching scores with the matching score of the successfully matched minutiae enables our matching method to get boosted recognition accuracy. The discrimination ability of the unmatched minutiae and the effectiveness of the proposed method are validated by the experimental results obtained using the FVC2000, FVC2002 and FVC2004 databases for international fingerprint verification competition.

However, the accuracy of identification reported in the state-of-the-art literature is low due to the distortion in latent fingerprint images. In this paper, we describe a new algorithm based on the use of clustering which is independent of the minutiae descriptors. The proposed technique improves the robustness of identification in the presence of large non-linear deformation which is associated with latent fingerprint images. The new algorithm finds multiple overlapping clusters of matching minutiae pairs which are merged together to find matching minutiae. Several experiments performed using latent fingerprint databases show that our proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracy than those presented in state-of-the-art literature. Moreover, the results show that the proposed algorithm is successful in dealing with the large distortion associated with latent fingerprints formed under the worst conditions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Biometrics; Latent fingerprints; Minutiae-based algorithms","Algorithms; Biometrics; Deformation; Image matching; Image processing; Palmprint recognition; Criminal investigation; Descriptors; Latent fingerprint; Nonlinear deformations; Overlapping clusters; State of the art; Clustering algorithms; algorithm; Article; biometry; cluster analysis; data base; deformable minutiae clustering algorithm; finger dermatoglyphics; forensic identification; image analysis; image quality; latent fingerprint identification; priority journal"

We introduce a new technique of user identification in healthcare capable of establishing a global identifier. Our research has developed algorithms capable of establishing a Unique Health Identifier (UHID) based on the user's fingerprint biometric, with the utilization of facial-recognition as a secondary validation step before health records can be accessed. Biometric captures are completed using standard smartphones and Web cameras in a touchless method.

Several formal criteria to serve this purpose have been published. In this paper, we present a framework to assess the value of the application of such criteria. We propose to quantify the need for the assessment of clinical relevance by the actual risk of having accepted a benefit for a treatment with an irrelevant effect in a successful RCT. We then study how this risk can be controlled by two popular criteria based on comparing the effect estimate or the lower bound of the confidence interval with a given threshold. We further propose to quantify the impact of using formal criteria by considering the expected costs when specifying error-specific costs for each of the three possible types of errors: A benefit may be accepted for a treatment, which is actually inferior, or which is not inferior, but only implies an irrelevant improvement, or a benefit may be rejected for a treatment implying a relevant improvement. This way we can demonstrate that the impact depends on parameters which are typically not explicitly defined in the frame of benefit assessments. Depending on the values of these parameters, formal checks of clinical relevance may imply better decisions on average, but they may also imply more harm than good on average. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

For testing, systems were selected that identify a person based on facial features. Testing showed errors in these readers under both standard and difficult conditions. Difficult conditions that we frequently encounter in everyday life were chosen. In the test of biometric identification systems the probability of erroneous user acceptance and probability of false rejection of the user was calculated and shown graphically. Wrong user acceptance was based on unfavorable conditions. Unfavorable conditions were: pollution with dark oil, pollution with soil, pollution with makeup, pollution with soot, pollution with black coal, pollution with paints. Another problem is the surrounding environment of the scanner device, in particular light conditions. The testing demonstrated that it is necessary to conduct identification of people under laboratory conditions, which is not acceptable from the user perspective. The results of the measurements showed that the measured reliability values do not correspond to those of the manufacturers. It is necessary to adapt and perfect these biometric identification systems for use in industrial areas, as they are often used in these areas as access or attendance systems.","Biometrics; Facial features; Reliability; Systems","Acceptance tests; Anthropometry; Bituminous coal; Computer systems; Face recognition; Pollution; Regional planning; Reliability; Attendance systems; Biometric identification systems; Facial feature; Laboratory conditions; Reliability values; Surrounding environment; User identification; User perspectives; Biometrics; biometry; human behavior; identification method; laboratory method; probability; reliability analysis; testing method"

Methods-In a multicenter cross-sectional study, 8070 sonographic examinations from low-risk pregnancies between 16 and 40 weeks' gestation were analyzed. The fetal measurements obtained were biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur diaphysis length. Quantile regression was used to examine the impact of parental height and weight, parity, and race across biometric percentiles for the fetal measurements considered. Results-Paternal and maternal height were significant covariates for all of the measurements considered (P < .05). Maternal weight significantly influenced head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur diaphysis length. Parity was significantly associated with biparietal diameter and head circumference. Central African race was associated with head circumference and femur diaphysis length, whereas North African race was only associated with femur diaphysis length. Conclusions-In this study we constructed customized biometric growth charts using quantile regression in a large cohort of low-risk pregnancies. These charts offer the advantage of defining individualized normal ranges of fetal biometric parameters at each specific percentile corrected for parental height and weight, parity, and race.

Methods: A total of 93 subjects who underwent myopic laser refractive surgery at IIUM Eye Specialist Clinic were recruited. The accuracy of postoperative corneal power using the standard CLM and newly-derived contact lens modified method (CLMmod) were compared to the standard comparison method ; the historical method (HM). The CLMmod equation was derived by adjusting postoperative corneal power of CLM according to amount of refractive change. Results: The mean postoperative corneal power using standard CLM was significantly higher than HM (mean difference: -0.24 D, p &lt; 0.001). Fifty seven percent (n = 53 eyes) of the standard CLM results were within ±0.50 D of HM results. The difference between postoperative corneal power using standard CLM and HM increased significantly with the amount of refractive change (r = 0.835; p &lt; 0.001). The mean postoperative corneal power of CLMmod showed that there was no statistical significant difference compared to the HM results (mean difference: 0.00 D, p= 0.964). Eighty eight percent (n = 82 eyes) of the CLMmod results were within ±0.50 D of HM results with improvement of 31% from the standard CLM results. Conclusion: The CLMmod equation provides more accurate calculation in determining post myopic laser refractive surgery corneal power. In near future, this modified equation can be used as an alternative equation to calculate postoperative corneal power when the preoperative data is unavailable.","Biometry post LASIK; Contact lens method; Contact lens modified method; Equation; Myopic laser refractive surgery",

Materials and Methods: Anterior-segment OCT imaging was performed on 30 normal eyes using Visante TD-OCT and 40 normal eyes using Cirrus SD-OCT. For Visante OCT, a single 16-mm line scan of the inferior angle with 3 slightly different rotations of 265, 270, and 275 degrees was performed. For Cirrus OCT, a 5-line raster of the inferior angle was performed, centering the third scan line at the 6 o'clock position, with 0.25mm between lines. ACA measurements were taken for angle-opening distance (AOD) and trabecular iris space area (TISA) at 500/750 mm from the scleral spur for Visante OCT and at Schwalbe's line (SL) for Cirrus OCT. Results: For Visante OCT, AOD500 was 0.406mm (SD=0.143 mm) and TISA500 was 0.139mm2 (0.054mm2). There was no difference in AOD500, AOD750, TISA500, or TISA750 between the 3 scan orientations (P>0.1 for all comparisons). For Cirrus OCT, AOD500 was 0.850±0.318mm and TISA500 was 0.325±0.145mm2. No difference was found in SL-AOD and SLTISA between the 3 scan positions. Conclusions: These findings suggest that small local changes in the position of the OCT line scan spaced up to 1.0mm apart on Cirrus, or 10-degree apart on Visante, did not significantly alter the inferior ACA metrics in achieving reliable measurements in young healthy eyes. Given the absence of tracking and registration for current anterior-segment OCT instruments, this observation is of relevance for longitudinal and dynamic studies of angle geometry. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Setting EYE and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Design Prospective observational study. Methods Eyes of patients preparing for cataract surgery were measured with Pentacam Scheimpflug imaging device. Keratometric astigmatism was obtained using the anterior corneal surface measurement and the keratometric index (1.3375) while neglecting the posterior corneal surface measurement. The Scheimpflug-measured total corneal astigmatism was derived by vector analysis of the astigmatism on both corneal surfaces. Results The study comprised 374 eyes of 374 patients 45 to 84 years old. The mean absolute error in magnitude and mean absolute error in angle comparing keratometric astigmatism with Scheimpflug-derived astigmatism was 0.18 ± 0.14 diopter (D) and 7.7 ± 11.0 degrees, respectively. The mean magnitude of the error vector was 0.24 ± 0.14 D. The error in magnitude was significantly larger in eyes with against-the-rule anterior astigmatism, while error in angle was larger in eyes with with-the-rule and oblique anterior astigmatism. Multiple regressions showed that 4 predictors (difference in anterior-posterior astigmatism axis, magnitude of posterior astigmatism, magnitude of keratometric astigmatism, and axial length [AL]) were significantly associated with the absolute error in magnitude. Predictors including the difference in the anterior-posterior astigmatism axis, magnitude of posterior astigmatism, magnitude of keratometric astigmatism, and age were significantly associated with the absolute error in angle and magnitude of the error vector. Conclusions Neglecting posterior corneal astigmatism yielded significant estimation errors in total corneal astigmatism in patients preparing for cataract surgery. Estimation errors were significantly influenced by the difference in the anterior -posterior astigmatism axis, magnitude of posterior astigmatism, keratometric astigmatism, AL, and age.

This phase II open-label trial aims to define a methodology for a clinically effective treatment of pain in FM by establishing treatment protocols and screening procedures to maximize efficacy and response rate. High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) provides targeted subthreshold brain stimulation, combining tolerability with specificity. We aimed to establish the number of HD-tDCS sessions required to achieve a 50% FM pain reduction, and to characterize the biometrics of the response, including brain network activation pain scores of contact heat-evoked potentials. We report a clinically significant benefit of a 50% pain reduction in half (n = 7) of the patients (N = 14), with responders and nonresponders alike benefiting from a cumulative effect of treatment, reflected in significant pain reduction (P =.035) as well as improved quality of life (P =.001) over time. We also report an aggregate 6-week response rate of 50% of patients and estimate 15 as the median number of HD-tDCS sessions to reach clinically meaningful outcomes.

Materials and methods A monocentric prospective study was conducted at the tertiary care teaching hospital in Lyon, including patients undergoing their second or third trimester planned ultrasound exam. For each patient, a resident and a senior practitioner measured each fetal transcerebellar diameter, during a blinded experiment, according to the transcerebellar plane described by the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology. Images have been scored on 4 criteria. The inter-observer variability for transcerebellar diameter and image quality was assessed using an intra-class correlation coefficient. Image quality has been analyzed according to pregnancy term and to fetal presentation. Results Sixty-six patients were included, 44 patients before and 22 patients after 30 weeks. Inter-observer variability of transcerebellar diameter measurement was 0.4%. Inter-observer variability of image quality was 13.5%. Image quality was not significantly different between seniors and residents (P = 0.06).

If the goal is estimation of the parameters of a marginal complete-data model for the outcome, biased inference will result from fitting the model of interest with only uncensored subjects. For example, investigators are interested in estimating a prognostic model for clinical events in HIV-positive patients, under the counterfactual scenario in which everyone remained on ART (when in reality, only a subset had). Inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) is a popular method that relies on correct estimation of the probability of censoring to produce consistent estimation, but is an inefficient estimator in its standard form. We introduce sequentially augmented regression (SAR), an adaptation of the Bang and Robins (2005. Doubly robust estimation in missing data and causal inference models. Biometrics 61, 962-972.) method to estimate a complete-data prediction model, adjusting for longitudinal missing at random censoring. In addition, we propose a closely related non-parametric approach using targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE; van der Laan and Rubin, 2006. Targeted maximum likelihood learning.

Because it doesn't require user intrusion, it is often used as a biometric to make authentication processes easier and hassle free. But there are various issues with this process. To start with, the viewing angle has to be constant which is quite difficult to achieve with limited number of cameras. Speed too can alter the way a person walks and cause inconsistencies in identification. Furthermore, complications might arise if the subject is carrying something. The weight can affect his walking pattern. Besides, a recent accident could also transform a person's walking pattern and lead to wrong identification. Other biometrics such as face detection can be combined with this technique to reduce the issues leading to erroneous identification. In this paper, we propose a system to overcome the viewing angle discrepancies. The system takes in walking sequences as input and processes them to create images. This is converted into 3D images by means of stereovision algorithms. Using which, we can effectively match the real-Time image with various image sequences in the database. Side face detection can enhance the accuracy further.","Gait energy image (GEI); Random subspace method (RSM) and majority voting (MV)","accident; biometry; data base; disease carrier; gait; human; recognition; velocity"

Accurate portable techniques are needed to facilitate use in clinical settings. This study evaluated the accuracy and repeatability of a portable ultrasound (US) in comparison with a four-compartment criterion for per cent body fat (%Fat) in overweight/obese adults. Fifty-one participants (mean ± SD; age: 37·2 ± 11·3 years; BMI: 31·6 ± 5·2 kg m-2) were measured for %Fat using US (GE Logiq-e) and skinfolds. A subset of 36 participants completed a second day of the same measurements, to determine reliability. US and skinfold %Fat were calculated using the seven-site Jackson-Pollock equation. The Wang 4C model was used as the criterion method for %Fat. Compared to a gold standard criterion, US %Fat (36·4 ± 11·8%; P = 0·001; standard error of estimate [SEE] = 3·5%) was significantly higher than the criterion (33·0 ± 8·0%), but not different than skinfolds (35·3 ± 5·9%; P = 0·836; SEE = 4·5%). US resulted in good reliability, with no significant differences from Day 1 (39·95 ± 15·37%) to Day 2 (40·01 ± 15·42%). Relative consistency was 0·96, and standard error of measure was 0·94%. Although US overpredicted %Fat compared to the criterion, a moderate SEE for US is suggestive of a practical assessment tool in overweight individuals. %Fat differences reported from these field-based techniques are less than reported by other single-measurement laboratory methods and therefore may have utility in a clinical setting.

In this paper, we discuss subgroup analyses with prespecified subgroups of clinical or biological importance. We explore various alternatives to the naive (the traditional univariate) subgroup analyses to address the issues of multiplicity and confounding. Specifically, we consider a model-based Bayesian shrinkage (Bayes-DS) and a nonparametric, empirical Bayes shrinkage approach (Emp-Bayes) to temper the optimism of traditional univariate subgroup analyses; a standardization approach (standardization) that accounts for correlation between baseline covariates; and a model-based maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach. The Bayes-DS and Emp-Bayes methods model the variation in subgroup-specific treatment effect rather than testing the null hypothesis of no difference between subgroups. The standardization approach addresses the issue of confounding in subgroup analyses. The MLE approach is considered only for comparison in simulation studies as the ""truth"" since the data were generated from the same model. Using the characteristics of a hypothetical large outcome trial, we perform simulation studies and articulate the utilities and potential limitations of these estimators. Simulation results indicate that Bayes-DS and Emp-Bayes can protect against optimism present in the naïve approach. Due to its simplicity, the naïve approach should be the reference for reporting univariate subgroup-specific treatment effect estimates from exploratory subgroup analyses. Standardization, although it tends to have a larger variance, is suggested when it is important to address the confounding of univariate subgroup effects due to correlation between baseline covariates. The Bayes-DS approach is available as an R package (DSBayes). © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

When installing biometric readers, many security risks that undermine the security of the entire building may arise. Risks that arise due to poor installation or different sabotage techniques are always a serious danger for guarded premises and may threaten guarded property. In order to avoid incorrect configuration of the entire system, it is important to ensure that the reader is installed and configured according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Errors often occur during installation arising from ignorance of how the system works and where its weaknesses are. As soon as the weaknesses of the used systems are known, countermeasures can be created against them. The problem of electric sabotage affects a large proportion of biometric systems. In the time of increasing property crime, it is highly important for biometric identification systems to be able to resist used electrical sabotage within the guarded area reliably and free of error. These tests are important both from an informative perspective and due to the possibilities of development of potential counter-measures which could lead to their improvement and an enhancement of their level of security.","Biometrics; Risks; Systems","Anthropometry; Computer systems; Crime; Regional planning; Risks; Biometric identification systems; Biometric systems; Entire system; Security risks; Sensitive informations; Used systems; Biometrics; biometry; building; data transmission; electricity; error analysis; identification method; information; installation; risk assessment"

A novel case of GATA1-positive TAM, in which following serial in utero blood transfusion clinical improvement and postnatal remission were observed, is included. Search strategy and data collection A systematic search of electronic databases (inception to October 2014) and reference lists, hand-searching of journals and expert contact. All confirmed cases of prenatal TAM were included for analysis. Data on study characteristics, design and quality were obtained. Results Of 73 potentially relevant citations identified, 22 studies were included, describing 39 fetuses. All studies included comprised single case or small cohort studies; overall quality was â every low'. Fetal/neonatal outcome was poor; 12 stillbirths (30.8%), 4 neonatal deaths (10.2%) and 7 infant deaths (17.9%). In two cases, the pregnancy was terminated (5.1%). TAM was primarily detected in the third trimester (79.4%), and in 14 a retrospective diagnosis was made postpartum. Ultrasound features indicative of TAM included hepatomegalyÂ±splenomegaly (79.5%), hydrops fetalis (30.8%), pericardial effusion (23.1%) and aberrant liquor volume (15.4%).

Setting Rotterdam Ophthalmic Institute, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Design Prospective cohort study. Methods Patients who had routine cataract surgery with implantation of a hydrophobic acrylic 1-piece IOL (Acrysof SA60AT) in the capsular bag were enrolled. Measurements were performed preoperatively and 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Refraction was measured with the ARK-530A autorefractor. The IOL position and corneal curvature were measured with the Lenstar LS-900 biometer. The refractive effect of changes in IOL position and corneal curvature was calculated with a Gaussian optics-based thin-lens formula and correlated with the measured refractive shift. Results The study group comprised 59 eyes of 59 patients. The median measured absolute refractive change was 0.25 diopter (D). The IOL position showed a statistically significant mean posterior shift of 0.033 mm ± 0.060 (SD) between 1 month and 1 year postoperatively (P <.01), of which the median calculated absolute refractive effect was 0.05 D. This did not correlate with the measured refractive shift (Pearson r = 0.10, P =.46). Natural fluctuations in corneal curvature caused a median calculated absolute refractive effect of 0.17 D, which correlated well with the measured refractive shift (Pearson r =.55, P <.001). Conclusions Long-term changes in refraction after cataract surgery resulted from natural fluctuations in corneal curvature rather than from IOL position shift. These fluctuations limit the accuracy with which the refractive outcome can be planned.

While these methods are mostly developed for single-modality scenarios, recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of feature-level fusion based on the joint sparse representation of the multimodal inputs. In this paper, we propose a multimodal task-driven dictionary learning algorithm under the joint sparsity constraint (prior) to enforce collaborations among multiple homogeneous/heterogeneous sources of information. In this task-driven formulation, the multimodal dictionaries are learned simultaneously with their corresponding classifiers. The resulting multimodal dictionaries can generate discriminative latent features (sparse codes) from the data that are optimized for a given task such as binary or multiclass classification. Moreover, we present an extension of the proposed formulation using a mixed joint and independent sparsity prior, which facilitates more flexible fusion of the modalities at feature level. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms for multimodal classification is illustrated on four different applications - multimodal face recognition, multi-view face recognition, multi-view action recognition, and multimodal biometric recognition. It is also shown that, compared with the counterpart reconstructive-based dictionary learning algorithms, the task-driven formulations are more computationally efficient in the sense that they can be equipped with more compact dictionaries and still achieve superior performance. © 2015 IEEE.","Dictionary learning; Feature fusion; Multimodal classification; Sparse representation","Classification (of information); Face recognition; Image classification; Dictionary learning; Dictionary learning algorithms; Feature fusion; Multi-class classification; Multi-modal; Multi-view action recognition; Multimodal face recognition; Sparse representation; Learning algorithms; algorithm; anatomy and histology; automated pattern recognition; biometry; face; human; image processing; machine learning; procedures; Algorithms; Biometric Identification; Face; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Pattern Recognition, Automated"

We measured the three-dimensional geometric profile around the optic nerve head (ONH) using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) in highly myopic eyes. METHODS. We studied 114 highly myopic eyes (<-6.0 diopters [D]) of 114 patients without glaucoma. Eyes were examined using the prototype SS-OCT. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and chorioscleral interface were traced, and the mean y-axis coordinates of 24 sectors were calculated in circular peripapillary (3.4-mm diameter) images. The peripapillary tilting index (PTI) was calculated by subtracting the mean y-axis coordinate of the RPE in a sector from the mean of all sectors. The main outcome measures were the PTI and its association with the staphyloma depth from the OCT images and the ovality index (OI) of the ONH and peripapillary atrophy (PPA) area from fundus photographs. RESULTS. The PTI differed significantly (P < 0.0001) among the 24 sectors and was lowest at the inferotemporal sector (-1930.76 μm). The minimal PTI value was in the temporal to inferotemporal sectors in 88 (77.2%) eyes and was correlated significantly with the OI (P < 0.0001) and age (P < 0.001) but not with the equivalent refractive error or axial length. The minimal PTI was correlated significantly with the PPA area (P < 0.05), minimal choroidal thickness (P < 0.05), macular choroidal thickness (P < 0.0001), and staphyloma depth (P <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. The peripapillary area is tilted inferotemporally in 77.2% of myopic eyes. Peripapillary tilting was markedly greater in older patients. Greater tilt was associated with a thinner choroid, more extensive PPA, and deeper staphyloma. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

Winter site fidelity often varies among age groups, but sexual differences have seldom been recorded in birds. We studied a population of individually colourmarked sanderlings wintering in and around the Tejo estuary, a large estuarine wetland on the western coast of Portugal. For 160 individuals, sighted a total of 1,249 times between November 2009 and March 2013, we calculated the probability that they moved among five distinct wintering sites and how this probability is affected by distance between them. To compare site fidelity among age classes and sexes, as well as within the same winter and over multiple winters, we used a Site Fidelity Index (SFI). Birds were sexed using a discriminant function based on biometrics of a large set of molecularly sexed sanderlings (n = 990). The vast majority of birds were observed at one site only, and the probability of the few detected movements between sites was negatively correlated with the distance among each pair of sites. Hardly any movements were recorded over more than 15 km, suggesting small home ranges. SFI values indicated that juveniles were less site-faithful than adults which may reflect the accumulated knowledge and/or dominance of older animals. Among adults, females were significantly less site faithful than males. A sexual difference in winter site fidelity is unusual in shorebirds. SFI values show site-faithfulness is lower when multiple winters were considered, and most birds seem to chose a wintering site early in the season and use that site throughout the winter. Sanderlings show a very limited tendency to explore alternative wintering options, which might have implications for their survival when facing habitat change or loss (e.g., like severe beach erosion as can be the case at one of the study sites). © 2016 Lourenço et al.","Age; Distance; Estuaries; Foraging areas; Movement; Sex; Shorebirds; Site fidelity; Winter","adolescent; adult; biometry; bird; discriminant analysis; estuary; female; foraging; habitat; home range; human; juvenile; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; Portugal; probability; seashore; sex difference; wetland; winter"

Trees spatial pattern can also influences since point-tree distances determine their inclusion in the sample. In this study, the precision and bias of BAC under different diametric distribution and spatial patterns were evaluated by the means of simulations. Normal and lognormal diametric distributions were simulated with basal area density ranging between 30-33 m2 ha-1. These diametric distributions were simulated in three spatial patterns: regular, random and clumped yielding six combinations. A seventh class was simulated with bimodal diametric distribution and a mixed spatial pattern: clumped for small trees and random for large trees. Bias was less than 0.10 m2 ha-1 except for clumped pattern with lognormal diametric distribution and mixed pattern. In these cases bias tended to be negative (-0.15 a -0.25 m2 ha-1). The lowest mean absolute deviation (MAD) was observed for the regular pattern 3-7 %. In the clumped pattern it ranged 7-10 % and 8-11 % in the mixed.

Methods: Children with congenital/developmental cataract aged 1.5 months old to 8 years old and no other ocular diseases were included. All eyes with unilateral cataract, the left eyes from children with bilateral cataracts, and healthy eyes from children with unilateral cataract were analyzed. After the administration of anesthesia, K was measured with a portable automatic keratometer, and AL was measured with a contact biometer. Cataract surgery was performed immediately after the measurements were taken. The data were statistically analyzed, and a linear regression with an age logarithm was used to model the relationship. Results: Forty-four eyes with cataract were included in this analysis, comprising 15 eyes with unilateral cataract and 29 left eyes from children with bilateral cataracts. The mean age was 27.3 months with a mean AL of 20.63 ± 2.11 mm and a mean K of 44.94 ± 2.44 D. The K value was significantly steeper and the AL value was significantly shorter in younger children (P<0.001). No significant differences were found neither between eyes with unilateral and bilateral cataracts nor between eyes with unilateral cataract and their corresponding healthy eyes (P>0.05). Conclusion: The values of K and AL significantly change with age, especially during the first 6 months of life. A linear functional relationship between K and AL with the logarithm of age and between K and AL was established.","Axial length; Cataract/congenital; Cornea/pathology; Corneal topography/methods; Eye; Intraocular; Lenses","age; biometry; Brazil; cataract; child; cornea; eye axis length; female; human; infant; male; pathology; pathophysiology; preschool child; procedures; reference value; retrospective study; statistical model; Age Factors; Axial Length, Eye; Biometry; Brazil; Cataract; Child; Child, Preschool; Cornea; Female; Humans; Infant; Linear Models; Male; Reference Values; Retrospective Studies"

Biometric data has been explored as a feasible common identifier between the health data and sociocultural data of resident members in rural communities within the Kintampo Health and Demographic Surveillance System located in the central part of Ghana. Objective: Our goal was to assess the feasibility of using fingerprint identification to link community data and hospital data in a rural African setting. Design: A combination of biometrics and other personal identification techniques were used to identify individual's resident within a surveillance population seeking care in two district hospitals. Visits from resident individuals were successfully recorded and categorized by the success of the techniques applied during identification. The successes of visits that involved identification by fingerprint were further examined by age. Results: A total of 27,662 hospital visits were linked to resident individuals. Over 85% of those visits were successfully identified using at least one identification method. Over 65% were successfully identified and linked using their fingerprints. Supervisory support from the hospital administration was critical in integrating this identification system into its routine activities. No concerns were expressed by community members about the fingerprint registration and identification processes. Conclusions: Fingerprint identification should be combined with other methods to be feasible in identifying community members in African rural settings. This can be enhanced in communities with some basic Demographic Surveillance System or census information.","Biometrics; Data-linkage; Database; Electronic; Fingerprint; Identification; Techniques","biometry; community care; dermatoglyphics; devices; electronic health record; Ghana; health care delivery; health survey; hospital management; human; information retrieval; organization and management; procedures; reproducibility; rural health care; Biometric Identification; Community Health Services; Delivery of Health Care; Dermatoglyphics; Electronic Health Records; Ghana; Hospital Administration; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Population Surveillance; Reproducibility of Results; Rural Health Services"

Design Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods One hundred thirty-two eyes of 132 consecutive patients who underwent phacoemulsification with implantation of a ZA9003 (Abbott Medical Optics Inc, Santa Ana, California, USA; 69 eyes) or AR40e (Abbott Medical Optics Inc; 63 eyes) IOL in the ciliary sulcus were enrolled. The modified effective lens position (ELP) equation based on the corneal radius (CR) (ELP - β0 - β1 × CR, where β0 and β1 are parameters in the linear regression analysis) was obtained using linear regression analysis in each IOL group, and was applied to the other IOL group in order to evaluate its effect on refractive outcomes in an independent data set. The median absolute error (MedAE) was predicted using the modified effective lens position equation and was compared with that predicted using the adjusted IOL power. Results The modified effective lens position equation was ELP + 11.662 - 1.6225 × CR in the ZA9003 group and ELP + 10.606 - 1.4817 × CR in the AR40e group. The MedAE that was predicted using the modified effective lens position equation (0.34 diopter [D] in the ZA9003 group and 0.42 D in the AR40e group) was significantly smaller than that predicted using the adjusted IOL power (0.47 D in the ZA9003 group and 0.66 D in the AR40e group) (P &lt;.001 and P =.005, respectively).

Correct modeling of the dose-toxicity relationship in patients receiving multiple cycles of the same dose in oncology trials is crucial. A major challenge lies in taking advantage of the conditional nature of data collection, that is each cycle is observed conditional on having no previous toxicities on earlier cycles. We develop a novel and parsimonious model for the probability of toxicity during a kth cycle of therapy, conditional on not seeing toxicity in any of the k-1 previous cycles using a Markov model, hereafter we refer to these probabilities as conditional probabilities of toxicity. Our model allows the conditional probability of toxicity to depend on randomized dose group, cumulative dose from prior cycles, a measure of how consistently a patient responds to the same dose exposure and individual risk factors influencing the ability to tolerate the treatment regimen. Simulations studying finite sample properties of the model are given. Finally, the approach is demonstrated in a phase II trial studying two dose levels of ifosfamide plus doxorubicin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in soft tissue sarcoma patients over four cycles. The Markov model provides correct estimates of the probabilities of toxicity in finite sample simulations. It also correctly models the data from the phase II clinical trial, and identifies particularly high cumulative toxicity in females. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Mass production of mosquitoes for large-scale releases demands a huge amount of water. Yet, many arid and/or seasonally arid countries face the difficulties of acute water shortage, deterioration of water quality and environmental constraints. The re-use of water to rear successive generations of larvae is attractive as a way to reduce water usage and running costs, and help to make this control method viable. Methods: To determine whether dirty larval water was a suitable rearing medium for Anopheles arabiensis, in place of the 'clean' dechlorinated water routinely used, a series of three experiments was carried out to evaluate the effect of dirty water or mixed clean and dirty water on several parameters of insect quality. Batches of 100 fresh eggs were distributed in dirty water or added to clean water to test the effect of dirty water on egg hatching, whereas first-instar larvae were used to determine the effect on immature development time, pupation, adult emergence, body size, and longevity. Moreover, to assess the effect of dirty water on larval mortality, pupation rate, adult emergence, and longevity, L4 larvae collected after the tilting or larvae/pupae separation events were returned either to the dirty water or added to clean water. Results: Results indicated that reusing dirty water or using a 50:50 mix of clean and dirty water did not affect egg hatching. Moreover, no difference was found in time to pupation, larval mortality or sex ratio when first-instar larvae were added to clean water, dirty water, or a 75:25, 50:50 or 25:75 mix of clean and dirty water and reared until emergence. When late-instar larvae were put back into their own rearing water, there was no effect on pupation rate, emergence rate or female longevity, though male longevity was reduced. When reared from first-instar larvae, however, dirty water decreased pupation rate, emergence rate, body size, and adult longevity. Conclusions: Re-used larval-rearing water has no impact on egg hatching, development time or mortality of the immature stages of An. arabiensis. However, dirty water is not suitable for the production of high quality adult mosquitoes.

Although in both operations the response confidence of the system is of great importance, in the verification process it becomes crucial. Indeed we want to determine, with a very low error, whether two templates correspond to the same subject or not. Most of the work devoted to biometrics are related to other stages of the process: the preprocessing, feature extraction or even the definition of robust metrics to compare them. Nevertheless, few works exist on the criteria used to the acceptance of a matching between two templates. In this work we focus on this decision criterion: we introduce a novel strategy based on the a contrario framework. We show several advantages of using this framework in the context of biometrics: it is automatically adapted to the data, it allows us to control the performance of the system in advance and can be used directly in the matching stage not requiring a prior training stage. In order to show the framework on a practical situation, we implement a face recognition system. We perform several experiments to validate this novel strategy using different databases, both private and public. Also the robustness of this technique is evaluated using different features and metrics. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms classic methods, with a consistent theory behind it, that can be naturally adapted to any biometric system. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","A contrario; ELBP; Face matching; Face verification; STASM","Biometrics; Feature extraction; A contrario; ELBP; Face matching; Face Verification; STASM; Face recognition; accuracy; algorithm; Article; biometry; face profile; image analysis; image processing; image quality; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; prediction; priority journal; probability; reliability"

Material and methods. A total of 50 patients (50 eyes) were followed up. All of them underwent vitrectomy for idiopathic epiretinal fibrosis and macular hole. In addition to the standard ophthalmic examination, we performed a combined ultrasound study and ultrasound biomicroscopy before and after the surgery (at 2 - 3 weeks and 6 months). Variation statistics was applied to assess the results using the SPSS Statistica 20 software. Results. According to ultrasound biomicroscopy, the following parameters increased: anterior chamber depth, trabecular-ciliary process distance, posterior chamber maximal depth and volume, and fiber length within the zonule of Zinn. In the late postoperative period (6 months after the surgery), there was an increase in lens volume and anterior-posterior ocular axis by the average of 0.15±0.04 mm. Against this background, clinical refraction shifted toward myopia by the average of 0.68±0.05 diopters in the early postoperative period and 1.7±0.15 diopters at 6 months. Conclusion. With the help of modern ultrasound examinations we have identified biometric changes in the anterior segment of vitrectomized eyes. We have also established a myopic shift of clinical refraction, which is most likely to be due to the increase in axial eye length and lenticular changes.","Anterior-posterior ocular axis; Avitria; Biometry; Clinical refraction; Ultrasound biomicroscopy; Vitrectomy","adult; adverse effects; aged; biomechanics; biometry; diagnostic imaging; echography; eye; female; human; male; middle aged; organ size; pathology; pathophysiology; Postoperative Complications; procedures; reproducibility; vitrectomy; Vitreoretinopathy, Proliferative; Adult; Aged; Biomechanical Phenomena; Biometry; Eye; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Postoperative Complications; Reproducibility of Results; Ultrasonography; Vitrectomy; Vitreoretinopathy, Proliferative"

Design: A prospective observational cohort study. Methods: One hundred eighty-twovolunteers (49 men, 133 women) with ages ranging from 17.7 to 78.6 years were recruited for floater assessment. Participants were assessed by a light box and by vitreoscope, after which they graded the floaters using a graphic classification system. They also completed a questionnaire to estimate the impact of floaters on daily life. In addition, biometric and refractive data were documented for all participants. Results: Using the light box method, 67.6% of participants reported seeing transparent floaters, which increased to 84.1% when using the vitreoscope. Opaque floaters were seen by 15.9% (light box) and 6.5% (vitreoscope). Reported levels of floater discomfort varied between participants, with 80.2% of participants reporting no discomfort and 6.6% reporting moderate to manifest discomfort. The perceived discomfort was weakly correlated with the amount of visualized floaters (light box: Pearson r = 0.323, P < 0.001; vitreoscope: r = 0.174, P < 0.001). Both floater perception and discomfort increased with age (r = 0.203, P = 0.006; r = 0.194, P = 0.009, respectively), although neither changed with axial length or refraction (P = 0.131, P = 0.070, respectively). Conclusions: The light box and the vitreoscope demonstrate that subclinical floaters are very common, even in nonsymptomatic subjects. The amount of perceived floaters in this cohort correlates only weakly with floater-related discomfort. © 2016 Asia Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology","Ocular biometry; Vitreoscope; Vitreous floaters; Vitreous opacities","adolescent; adult; age; aged; Eye Diseases; eye refraction; female; human; male; middle aged; physiology; prospective study; questionnaire; visual acuity; vitreous body; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Eye Diseases; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Refraction, Ocular; Surveys and Questionnaires; Visual Acuity; Vitreous Body; Young Adult"

Gaining insight into the mechanics of Paramecium swimming in a capillary tube is vital for optimizing the design of such systems. There are two approaches to modeling the physics of micro swimming. In the envelope approach, which is widely accepted by researchers, Paramecium is approximated as a sphere, self-propelled by tangential and normal surface distortions. However, not only is this approach incapable of considering the specific geometry of Paramecium, but it also neglects short range hydrodynamic interactions due to beating cilia, thus, leading to dissimilarity between experimental data and simulation results. The aim of this study is to present a sub layer approach to modeling Paramecium locomotion that is capable of directly applying hydrodynamic interactions due to beating cilia onto the Paramecium boundary. In this approach, the Paramecium boundary is discretized to hydro dynamically independent elements and, at each time step of swimming, a specific function is fit to the Paramecium boundary. Then, element coordinates are extracted and fluid dynamic equations are solved to model the physics of micro swimming. © 2016 Sharif University of Technology.

We compare the precision of random and systematic fi eld sampling survey designs under these two processes of species clustering. Second, we evaluate the performance of 13 estimators for the variance of the sample mean from a systematic survey. Replicated simulated surveys, as counts from 100 transects, allocated either randomly or systematically within the study region, were used to estimate population density in six spatial point populations including habitat patches and Matérn circular clustered aggregations of organisms, together and in combination. The standard one-start aligned systematic survey design, a uniform 10 × 10 grid of transects, was much more precise. Variances of the 10 000 replicated systematic survey mean densities were one-third to one-fi fth of those from randomly allocated transects, implying transect sample sizes giving equivalent precision by random survey would need to be three to fi ve times larger. Organisms being restricted to patches of habitat was alone suffi cient to yield this precision advantage for the systematic design. But this improved precision for systematic sampling in clustered populations is underestimated by standard variance estimators used to compute confi dence intervals. True variance for the survey sample mean was computed from the variance of 10 000 simulated survey mean estimates. Testing 10 published and three newly proposed variance estimators, the two variance estimators (v) that corrected for inter-transect correlation (v8 and vW) were the most accurate and also the most precise in clustered populations. These greatly outperformed the two ""post-stratifi cation"" variance estimators (v2 and v3) that are now more commonly applied in systematic surveys. Similar variance estimator performance rankings were found with a second differently generated set of spatial point populations, v8 and vW again being the best performers in the longer-range autocorrelated populations. However, no systematic variance estimators tested were free from bias. On balance, systematic designs bring more narrow confi dence intervals in clustered populations, while random designs permit unbiased estimates of (often wider) confi dence interval. The search continues for better estimators of sampling variance for the systematic survey mean. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","Clustered populations; Environmental monitoring; Habitat patchiness; Random sampling; Spatial autocorrelation; Survey precision; Systematic sampling; Transect; Two-dimensional survey design; Variance estimators","animal; autocorrelation; biological survey; confidence interval; design; environmental monitoring; patch use; plant; population density; precision; sampling; sampling bias; transect; variance analysis; Animalia; animal; animal dispersal; biological model; biometry; ecosystem; methodology; procedures; statistical model; Animal Distribution; Animals; Biometry; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Research Design"

When studying for each of the three operators, there were 79%, 72% and 98% of the stomach into the abdominal circumference, a significant difference between operators (P = 0.0029). Regarding the secondary criteria, the quality criteria found most often were the calipers and well placed ellipse (89%). Conclusion According to the previous studies, the stomach seems to be a reference to search. Our study shows variability depending on the different operators. If a hierarchy of quality criteria is to be considered, the stomach does not seem to be the first criterion to search. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS","Abdominal circumference; Fetal biometry; Reproducibility; Ultrasound measurement","abdomen; anthropometry; embryology; female; fetus echography; fetus weight; gestational age; human; pregnancy; stomach; Abdomen; Anthropometry; Female; Fetal Weight; Gestational Age; Humans; Pregnancy; Stomach; Ultrasonography, Prenatal"

Recommendations were developed to improve the efficiency of ultrasound conducted in the third trimester (T3), because neonatal consequences can be significant. This study aims to evaluate screening of SGA during T3 ultrasound and to describe causes for failure and differences with the recommendations of CNGOF. Methods All children born between 2011 and 2012 with a birth weight below the 3rd percentile were included in this observational, retrospective, monocentric study. We noted that the diagnosis of SGA was placed on file. Then, as recommended by the CNGOF, we calculated estimated fetal weight (EFW) with Hadlock 3 and Hadlock 4, and the corresponding percentiles, using the biometrics from the ultrasound report. We thus could evaluate a new screening rate with SGA fetus identified through this technique. Results A total of 142 patients were included. By calculating correctly all EFW and checking abdominal circumference percentiles, the screening rate of SGA fetuses with T3 ultrasound increased from 40 % to 50 % and the overall screening rate (clinical and ultrasound) from 54 % to 66 %. Conclusion By following the recommendations we found a real improvement in fetal SGA screening rates to T3 ultrasound with a potential benefit for their care. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS","Estimated fetal weight (EFW); Fetus small for gestational age (SGA); Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR); Screening; Ultrasound","abdominal circumference; Article; biometry; female; fetus; fetus echography; fetus weight; health care utilization; human; major clinical study; observational study; prenatal diagnosis; retrospective study; small for date infant; third trimester pregnancy"

Humans viewing ambiguous stimuli in a stable visual environment are generally more likely to see the perceptual interpretation that matches their expectations, but it is less clear how expectations affect perception when the environment is changing predictably. We used statistical learning to teach observers arbitrary sequences of natural images and employed binocular rivalry to measure perceptual selection as a function of predictive context. In contrast to previous demonstrations of preferential selection of predicted images for conscious awareness, we found that recently acquired sequence predictions biased perceptual selection toward unexpected natural images and image categories. These perceptual biases were not associated with explicit recall of the learned image sequences. Our results show that exposure to arbitrary sequential structure in the environment impacts subsequent visual perceptual selection and awareness. Specifically, for natural image sequences, the visual system prioritizes what is surprising, or statistically informative, over what is expected, or statistically likely.","Binocular rivalry; Expectation; Perceptual selection; Prediction; Visual statistical learning","adolescent; adult; awareness; binocular vision; biometry; depth perception; female; human; male; perception; physiology; vision; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Awareness; Biometry; Female; Humans; Male; Perceptual Masking; Vision Disparity; Vision, Binocular; Visual Perception; Young Adult"

Despite their important role in these ecosystems, and their potential as bioindicators and paleoindicators, they remain poorly studied in Mexico. The major objectives of this study were to: 1) increase knowledge of testate amoebae in Mexico’s tropical lakes, and 2) create a catalog of high-quality scanning electron micrographs that can be used for future ecological and paleoenvironmental studies. We collected surface-sediment samples from 29 lakes, located in the Transmexican Volcanic Belt, one at each lake during June and October 2011, and March 2013. Sediments were collected with an Ekman grab and preserved in anhydrous ethanol. Sub-samples were observed under a stereomicroscope and morphometric data for each species were recorded. Total diameter and aperture diameter were measured on circular tests. Irregularly shaped tests were measured for length and width of the aperture and for the size of the whole test. If a specimen possessed spines, the length of one randomly selected spine was measured. The best-preserved specimen of each taxon was photographed with an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). We found 41 taxa of testate amoebae belonging to the genera: Arcella, Argynnia, Centropyxis, Cucurbitella, Cyclopyxis, Cyphoderia, Difflugia, Euglypha, Lesquereusia, Pentagonia, Pseudodifflugia and Scutiglypha. Twelve species not previously reported for Mexico were recorded, along with 13 varieties. The average number of taxa recorded in each lake was eight, and the highest taxonomic richness was 18. The taxon found in the greatest number of lakes was Centropyxis aculeata var. aculeata. Taxonomic richness varied among lakes in the same region. This could reflect lake-specific differences in environmental conditions, underscoring the need for more detailed studies that include collection of data on physical and chemical variables in the lakes. Our results highlighted the need of further studies for the distribution patterns and ecology of lacustrine testate amoebae. © 2016, Universidad de Costa Rica.

To tackle multiple adverse issues with the established classifier-based or probability-based algorithms, in this paper we propose a novel order-preserving probabilistic score fusion algorithm, Order-Preserving Tree (OPT), by casting the score fusion problem into an optimisation problem with the natural order-preserving constraint. OPT is an algorithm fully non-parametric and widely applicable, not assuming any parametric forms of probabilities or independence among sources, directly estimating the posterior probabilities from maximum likelihood estimation, and exploiting the power of tree-structured ensembles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our OPT algorithm by comparing it with many widely used score fusion algorithms on two prevalent multibiometric databases. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Multibiometric system; Order-preserving algorithm; Score fusion; Tree-structured ensemble","Biometrics; Forestry; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Optimization; Probability; Trees (mathematics); Biometric authentication; Discriminative power; Multibiometric systems; Optimisation problems; Order-preserving algorithms; Posterior probability; Score fusion; Tree-structured; Algorithms; algorithm; Article; biometry; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; factual database; maximum likelihood method; multiple biometric trait; NIST face database; Order PreservingTree; priority journal; probability; score fusion algorithm; validation process"

It is uncertain to what degree the 2 disorders reflect the same genetic and environmental risk factors. The current study addresses the stability and co-occurrence of SAD and AvPD, the factor structure of the diagnostic criteria, and genetic and environmental factors underlying the disorders at 2 time points. SAD and AvPD were assessed in 1,761 young adult female twins at baseline and 1,471 of these approximately 10 years later. Biometric models were fitted to dimensional representations of SAD and AvPD. SAD and AvPD were moderately and approximately equally stable from young to middle adulthood, with increasing cooccurrence driven by environmental factors. At the first wave, approximately 1 in 3 individuals with AvPD had SAD, increasing to 1 in 2 at follow-up. The diagnostic criteria for SAD and AvPD had a two-factor structure with low cross-loadings. The relationship between SAD and AvPD was best accounted for by a model with separate, although highly correlated (r =.76), and highly heritable (.66 and.71) risk factors for each disorder. Their genetic and environmental components correlated.84 and.59, respectively. The finding of partially distinct risk factors indicates qualitative differences in the etiology of SAD and AvPD. Genetic factors represented the strongest time-invariant influences, whereas environmental factors were most important at the specific points in time. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Avoidant personality disorder; Social anxiety disorder; Social phobia; Twin study","adult; age distribution; Article; avoidant personality disorder; biological model; biometry; disease association; dizygotic twins; DSM-IV; environmental factor; fear; female; follow up; heredity; human; interview; longitudinal study; major clinical study; middle aged; monozygotic twins; pathogenesis; prevalence; qualitative analysis; rating scale; risk assessment; risk factor; social phobia; symptom; twins; young adult; complication; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; genetics; male; Personality Disorders; Phobia, Social; psychology; register; twins; Adult; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Personality Disorders; Phobia, Social; Registries; Twins; Young Adult"

Currently, most of the existing methods, like Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic and so forth, are time-consuming, especially for large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a fast framework for abrupt change detection based on binary search trees (BSTs) and a modified KS statistic, named BSTKS (binary search trees and Kolmogorov statistic). In this method, first, two binary search trees, termed as BSTcA and BSTcD, are constructed by multilevel Haar Wavelet Transform (HWT); second, three search criteria are introduced in terms of the statistic and variance fluctuations in the diagnosed time series; last, an optimal search path is detected from the root to leaf nodes of two BSTs. The studies on both the synthetic time series samples and the real electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings indicate that the proposed BSTKS can detect abrupt change more quickly and efficiently than KS, t -statistic (t), and Singular-Spectrum Analyses (SSA) methods, with the shortest computation time, the highest hit rate, the smallest error, and the highest accuracy out of four methods. This study suggests that the proposed BSTKS is very helpful for useful information inspection on all kinds of bioelectric time series signals. © 2016 Jin-Peng Qi et al.",,"Binary trees; Bioelectric phenomena; Data mining; Electroencephalography; Forestry; Spectrum analysis; Statistics; Time series; Time series analysis; Wavelet transforms; Abrupt change detection; Binary search trees; Bioelectric signals; Haar wavelet transforms (HWT); Kolmogorov statistics; Large-scale datasets; Singular spectrum analysis; Time series signals; Signal detection; algorithm; biometry; computer simulation; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; human; nonparametric test; physiology; signal processing; time factor; wavelet analysis; Algorithms; Biometry; Brain Waves; Computer Simulation; Electroencephalography; Humans; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Statistics, Nonparametric; Time Factors; Wavelet Analysis"

Setting Multicenter clinical trial. Design Prospective evaluation of diagnostic test. Methods In this study, 2 samples of adult patients were enrolled, 1 in the United States and the other in China. The U.S. group included a sample of consecutive patients scheduled for cataract surgery. The China group included a sample of healthy subjects with no cataracts. In both cases, only 1 eye of each patient was analyzed. Axial length (AL), corneal power (in diopters [D]) (K), anterior chamber depth (ACD) (corneal epithelium to lens), and corneal astigmatism were measured. All values were analyzed using a paired t test, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r), and Bland-Altman plots. Results In the U.S. and China groups, the OLCI mean AL values did not show a statistically significant difference from PCI values and showed excellent agreement and correlation. On the contrary, OLCI measured a lower mean K (-0.14 D) and a deeper ACD measurements (U.S. +0.16 mm and China +0.05 mm). These differences were statistically significant (P <.0001). Vector analysis did not show a statistically significant difference in astigmatism measurements. Conclusions Agreement between OLCI and PCI was good. However, the small but statistically significant differences in K and ACD measurements make constant optimization necessary when calculating the intraocular lens power using theoretical formulas.

Methods: In this prospective randomized case series, we measured ACD and WTW distance in one eye of 40 healthy subjects with Pentacam HR, IOL Master 500, LenStar 900, and Visante OCT. Results: When comparing WTW distance with anterior chamber angle diameter measured by Visante OCT coefficient of repeatability and limits of agreement ranges were 0.5 and 1.1 mm for IOL Master, 0.5 and 1.1 mm for Pentacam HR, and 0.6 and 1.1 mm for LenStar (P < 0.05 in all cases), respectively. Coefficient of repeatability and limits of agreement ranges were 0.3 and 0.6 mm for IOL Master, 0.3 and 0.5 mm for Pentacam HR, and 0.3 and 0.6 mm for LenStar, respectively, compared with ACD measured by Visante OCT; however, P was not significant in any of the cases. P value was also not significant when comparing IOL Master, LenStar, and Pentacam in terms of ACD and WTW distance with each other. Conclusions: Unlike previous groups analyzing the ACD and WTW distance we found no significant difference between the measurements by different automatic devices.

Such vertices are pervasive in our visual world but the importance of a statistical regularity about them has been underappreciated: The contours defining the vertex are (almost) always of the same direction of contrast with respect to the background (i.e., both darker or both lighter). Here we show that when the two contours are of different directions of contrast, the capacity of the L-vertex to signal the termination of a surface, as reflected in object recognition, is markedly reduced. Although image statistics have been implicated in determining the connectivity in the earliest cortical visual stage (V1) and in grouping during visual search, this finding provides evidence that such statistics are involved in later stages where object representations are derived from twodimensional images.","Contrast polarity; Direction of contrast; L-vertices; Natural image statistics","adolescent; adult; biometry; contrast sensitivity; female; human; male; pattern recognition; physiology; visual cortex; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Biometry; Contrast Sensitivity; Female; Form Perception; Humans; Male; Visual Cortex; Young Adult"

Methods Forty eyes of 40 patients undergoing HD were included in this cross-sectional study. Keratometry (K) readings, white-to-white (WTW) distance, central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), pupil diameter, lens thickness (LT), axial length (AL), and intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation were measured with Lenstar LS 900 (Haag Streit AG, Koeniz, Switzerland) before and after hemodialysis. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured with a non-contact tonometer (Tonopachy NT-530P, Nidek Co., LTD, Tokyo, Japan). Main outcomes were changes in biometric parameters after HD. Reliability of the measurements (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs)) and the effect size (Cohens d) were also calculated. Results Mean difference in AL before and after HD was -0.041 ± 0.022 mm with ICCs > 0.90 (p < 0.001 and Cohens d = 0.06). Pupil diameter was also significantly different before (4.28 ± 0.81 mm) and after (4.44 ± 0.79 mm) HD with ICCs > 0.90 (p = 0.041 and Cohens d = 0.20). Hemodialysis had no significant effect on K readings, WTW distance, CCT, ACD, LT, or IOP.

Torretta (L'Aquila-central Apennines), are investigated applying the biometric analysis on the embryo-nepionic chambers and on the fifth stage of the neanic equatorial chamberlets, supplying additional data about parameters and factors that had already demonstrated to have taxonomic-biostratigraphic significance. The occurrence of the whole sequence of different evolutionary stages, Nephrolepidina praemarginata-N. morgani-N. tournoueri, is confirmed. These chronospecies, characterizing the Mediterranean lineage, follow an evolutionary development according to the principles of ""embryonic and nepionic acceleration"". The data evidence that the ""Degree of stolonic distalization"" (Factor FD5) and the ""Shape Index"" (Factor SI5), measured at the 5th neanic stage, have a very good fitting with the previously evidenced overall trend to elongate the shape of the equatorial chamberlets, connected with their packing (golden selection) and a gradually more distal position of the radial stolons (Neanic acceleration). However, according to the biometrical investigation of embryo-nepionic apparatuses, there are significant taxonomic issues, hampering an effective application of the genus to high-resolution biostratigraphy. Both the typological and the quantitative specific, phylogenetic and biostratigraphic definitions, could be improved by means of an integration of the embryonic-nepionic-neanic data. In that way, a significant preliminary goal is reached, suggesting two new, tentative, preliminary biometric boundaries between the chronospecies.","Biometry; Biostratigraphy; Larger foraminifera; Lepidocyclinidae; Miocene; Oligocene; Taxonomy","benthic foraminifera; biometry; biostratigraphy; evolutionary biology; Miocene; Oligocene; paleontology; protist; taxonomy; Abruzzi; Italy; L'Aquila; Aquila; Foraminifera; Lepidocyclinidae"

The purpose of this study was to investigate normative ocular biometric parameters and their associations in an older Chinese population. Methods: This was a cross-sectional observational study. From 2013 to 2014, we recruited inhabitants aged 50 years or older in Guangzhou, China. Among 1,117 participants in the study, data from 1,015 phakic right eyes were used for analyses. Ocular parameters including axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and corneal curvature (K) were measured using an IOL Master. Results: The mean AL, ACD, and K were 23.48 mm [95 % confidence interval (CI), 23.40-23.55], 3.03 mm (CI, 3.01-3.05), and 44.20 mm (CI, 44.11-44.29), respectively. A mean reduction in ACD with age was observed (P = 0.002) in male subjects but not in female subjects (P = 0.558). Male subjects had significantly longer ALs (23.68 mm versus 23.23 mm, P < 0.001), deeper ACDs (3.13 mm versus 2.95 mm, P < 0.001), and flatter Ks (43.85D versus 44.50 D, P < 0.001) than female subjects. Eyes with axial elongation had a flatter cornea (r = -0.437, P < 0.001) and a deeper anterior chamber (r = 0.652, p < 0.001). The ACD was correlated with K (r = -0.266, P < 0.001). Conclusions: These data provide normative values for AL, ACD, and K using the IOL Master for a population in South China. The AL in this Chinese cohort was greater than that observed in the Singaporean Chinese but smaller than that observed in Malaysia and for Caucasians. The Chinese have a shallower ACD than some other racial groups. Age and sex were the most consistent predictors of ocular biometry in the older population from South China. © 2016 Chen et al.","Anterior chamber depth; Axial length; Corneal curvature","age; aged; anatomy and histology; anterior eye chamber; Asian continental ancestry group; China; cornea; cross-sectional study; eye axis length; female; human; keratometry; male; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; sex difference; very elderly; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anterior Chamber; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Axial Length, Eye; China; Cornea; Corneal Topography; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Sex Factors; Tomography, Optical Coherence"

Our understanding of the child's eye both in terms of tissue mechanics, neurobiological plasticity and physiological growth has allowed better and better surgical outcomes. The fact remains that the younger the child - infants especially - the more difficult the surgery. It is also true to say that not only is a child's eye not a small adult eye, but also that the child him- or herself is not a small adult. The importance of this statement is evident when we discuss the effects of anesthesia and fluid input in infants during infant cataract surgery. This chapter discusses the factors that should help give a child the best possible outcome after cataract surgery including timing of surgery, type of operation, biometry, the size and type of intraocular lens material, postoperative refraction, operative considerations, wound size and type, capsule management, anterior vitrectomy technique, wound closure and viscoelastic removal and perioperative medications. © 2016 S.

Chemotherapy is cytotoxic and interferes with cell growth. When chemotherapy is given during the first trimester of pregnancy, the period of organogenesis, there is an increased risk of structural anomalies. When given beyond the first trimester, chemotherapy does not cause other or more congenital malformations. Several studies have reported on the short- and long-term outcome of children exposed to chemotherapy during the second and third trimester of pregnancy with reassuring results for neurocognitive development and cardiac functions. A single case of secondary malignancy in the child was reported. Chemotherapy administration during pregnancy may lead to lower birth weights, but biometry curves seem to normalize during the first months of childhood. Prenatal exposure to platinum-based antineoplastics may induce hearing loss, especially when high dosages are used. Since prematurity has been related to decreased cognitive functioning, postponement of delivery can be achieved by maternal cancer treatment during pregnancy. Overall, the use of several chemotherapeutic agents during pregnancy is considered safe and could help optimizing patient management without compromising fetal outcome. ©Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Cancer; Cardiac function; Chemotherapy; Neurocognitive development; Pregnancy",

To evaluate and compare the accuracy of different intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation formulas for eyes with an axial length (AL) greater than 26.00 mm. Methods. This study reviewed 407 eyes of 219 patients with AL longer than 26.0 mm. The refractive prediction errors of IOL power calculation formulas (SRK/T, Haigis, Holladay, Hoffer Q, and Barrett Universal II) using User Group for Laser Interference Biometry (ULIB) constants were evaluated and compared. Results. One hundred seventy-one eyes were enrolled. The Barrett Universal II formula had the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and SRK/T and Haigis had similar MAE, and the statistical highest MAE were seen with the Holladay and Hoffer Q formulas. The interquartile range of the Barrett Universal II formula was also the lowest among all the formulas. The Barrett Universal II formulas yielded the highest percentage of eyes within ±1.0 D and ±0.5 D of the target refraction in this study (97.24% and 79.56%, resp.). Conclusions. Barrett Universal II formula produced the lowest predictive error and the least variable predictive error compared with the SRK/T, Haigis, Holladay, and Hoffer Q formulas.

We surveyed carapace width, chela length and width, dactylus length, and propodus length of both chelae of 93 females and 114 males to the nearest 0.05 mm using a vernier caliper. Our main result was the identification of morphological biometry showing a variability of the chela linked to growth allometry, with some different between-sex ontogenic trajectories. Specifically, we emphasized how the morphometric features of the chelae change during body-size growth with different increasing rates. Particularly, the observed significant shape changes are mainly due to positive allometries in both sexes, although negative allometries (the latter visible only in the propodus length of females) and isometries were observed as well. Our study confirms that a form of sexual dimorphism exists in the ontogenetic allometric trajectories of P. fluviatile in both the large and small chelae, these trajectories being related to mechanical aspects in predation, food manipulation, mate acquisition, and between-sex differences in aggressiveness during antagonistic fights. © 2016 by The Crustacean Society.

The study followed a completely randomized design with three treatments and three repetitions: treatment no prawns, no feed (noPnoF); treatment prawns, no feed (PnoF); and treatment prawns, feed (PF). Six pens were stocked with 10 prawns m-2 with average initial weight of 0.63 ± 0.05 g and average length of 4.28 ± 0.14 cm; the other three pens were not stocked with prawns. Every 10 days, prawn biometry was carried out and samples were collected from the water and the sediment in each pen. The results showed that the limnological variables remained adequate for the species' biology. The zootechnical indices did not differ significantly (P &gt; 0.05) in weight, total length and survival, with values of 4.43 ± 0.93 g, 8:03 ± 0:43 cm, and 80 ± 9.6%, respectively, for the treatment PnoF, and 4.83 ± 1.03 g, 8.42 ± 0.51 cm and 73 ± 3.5% for treatment PF.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of storage time on testicular and epididymal biometry, sperm reserves and epididymal sperm characteristics of red Sokoto bucks post mortem. Materials and Methods: Testes-epididymides were collected immediately after slaughter of mature red Sokoto bucks and transported in ice chest to the laboratory. The samples were either processed immediately or stored at 4°C in refrigerator for 24, 48 h and then processed. The testes and epididymides were measured and weighed. Sperm motility, concentration, livability, morphology, intact acrosome, and sperm reserves from different treatment groups including control were evaluated and means (±standard error of mean) were recorded. Results: There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the testicular and epididymal dimensions determined between the means of the groups. Percent sperm motility and viability decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after 24 h from 69.00±0.46 and 71.27±0.50% to 50.60±0.48 and 60.47±0.70% at 48 h, respectively. Significant decreases (p < 0.05) in epididymal sperm concentration and intact acrosome from 2.86±0.08 and 92.87±0.39 at 0 to 24 h of storage, respectively, were observed.

The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of different live preys (Artemia and crustacean zoeae) and/or Artemia enrichment protocols in the paralarval growth by using a meta-analysis approach. A total of 26 independent assays were used, including data from the bibliography and from experiments carried out by our group. Three comparisons were established: (i) crustacean zoeae vs. Artemia, (ii) different crustacean zoeae species and (iii) Artemia enriched with marine lecithin (rich in polar lipids-PL and docosahexaenoic acid-DHA) vs. previously used Artemia enrichments. The meta-analysis approach allowed a quantitative review of independent studies with reliable conclusions, avoiding the subjectivity inherent to classical reviews. The outputs provided statistical confirmation of the better suitability of crustacean zoeae with respect to Artemia. However, not all crustacean species showed the same results, given that the high variability on Grapsus zoeae hampered finding significant differences with respect to the control treatment (Artemia). Nutrient composition and biometry of the different types of prey are discussed as possible causes of the differences arising from the meta-analysis. Finally, the present results suggest that marine lecithin has a beneficial effect on paralarval growth with respect to previously used enrichments, which could be related to the increase in DHA and PL in Artemia, given the essential role of these lipid components in octopus paralarval physiology. © 2016 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Growth; Meta-analysis; Octopus vulgaris; Paralarvae; Prey",

Setting GB Bietti Foundation IRCCS, Rome, Italy. Design Noninterventional theoretical study. Methods The IOL power for emmetropia was first calculated in an eye model with the AL ranging from 20 to 30 mm and K from 38 to 48 diopters (D). Then, the predicted myopic refraction for any given IOL add power (from +1.5 to +4.0 D) was calculated, and from this value the near focal distance was obtained. Calculations were also performed for the average eye (K = 43.81 D; AL = 23.65 mm). Results The near focal distance increased with increasing values of K and AL for each near power add. The near focal distance ranged between 53 cm and 72 cm (21 inches and 28 inches) for a multifocal IOL with +2.50 D, between 44 cm and 60 cm (17 inches and 24 inches) for a multifocal IOL with +3.00 D add, and between 33 cm and 44 cm (13 inches and 18 inches) for a multifocal IOL with +4.00 D add. In the average eye, the near focal distance ranges between 36 cm (near add power = 4.00 D) and 99 cm (near add power = 1.5 D). Conclusions Longer eyes with steeper corneas showed the longest near focal distance and could experience more difficulties in focusing near objects after surgery.

Despite this large body size, male wapiti produce whistle-like sexual calls called bugles characterised by an extremely high fundamental frequency. Investigations of the biometry and physiology of the male wapiti's relatively large larynx have so far failed to account for the production of such a high fundamental frequency. Our examination of spectrograms of male bugles suggested that the complex harmonic structure is best explained by a dual-source model (biphonation), with one source oscillating at a mean of 145 Hz (F0) and the other oscillating independently at an average of 1426 Hz (G0). A combination of anatomical investigations and acoustical modelling indicated that the F0 of male bugles is consistent with the vocal fold dimensions reported in this species, whereas the secondary, much higher source at G0 is more consistent with an aerodynamic whistle produced as air flows rapidly through a narrow supraglottic constriction. We also report a possible interaction between the higher frequency G0 and vocal tract resonances, as G0 transiently locks onto individual formants as the vocal tract is extended. We speculate that male wapiti have evolved such a dual-source phonation to advertise body size at close range (with a relatively low-frequency F0 providing a dense spectrum to highlight size-related information contained in formants) while simultaneously advertising their presence over greater distances using the very high-amplitude G0 whistle component. © 2016, Company of Biologists Ltd.

To pursue this challenge, a Request For Proposals (RFP) was issued in 1983 by The U.S. Epidemiology and Biometry Research Program at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). A consortium was set up at the universities and university hospitals in Trondheim, Bergen (Norway) and Uppsala (Sweden) and was funded by the NICHD to conduct the Scandinavian Successive Small-for-Gestational Age (SGA) Pregnancy and Birth Outcome Study. The study design included a comprehensive biobank with maternal and cord serum samples, placental tissue, and a multitude of data collected from interviews, questionnaires, and clinical examinations. The SGA cohort study involved 6,354 Caucasian pregnant women in the three study sites who expected their second or third child from 1986-88. The study women were screened in early second trimester and mothers who had an increased risk to deliver a smaller than expected newborn were followed in detail through the second half of pregnancy and at birth. Selected children were screened several times through their first and up to five years of age. Moreover, a highly selected subgroup in Trondheim has been followed at 14, 19, and 26 years’ age. Almost thirty years later, we have searched the body of scientific publications that originated from this cohort study in an attempt to assess if and to what extent the main aims and objectives were achieved and to summarize the overall outcomes. The SGA cohort has resulted in close to 100 published papers in peer reviewed journals and some 40 graduate and undergraduate degrees. Risk factors of SGA, like maternal smoking, low pre-pregnancy weight and education attainment, and a previous SGA birth outcome were confirmed. Conversely, no totally new and unknown risk factors were identified. Serial ultrasound measures have enabled a distinction between SGA with restricted and normal intrauterine growth, and has further indicated that being born SGA is mainly a problem in combination with IUGR. Further, the consequences of IUGR are more pronounced at adolescence and young adulthood than at five years of age. An increased understanding of the pathogenesis of different categories of growth restriction is essential to recognize and diagnose IUGR properly, and to reduce the perinatal mortality and morbidity from SGA. Moreover, SGA is a significant predictor at follow-up of the child. An up to date biobank has ensured the quality of data and biological samples, and has been crucial for the outcome of the entire SGA study. It continues to be a valuable resource in future research. © 2016 Norwegian Epidemiological Society. All Rights Reserved.",,

It is at various stages of acceptance and approvals for eye care, coronary care and skin cancer care and is spreading rapidly to other medical specialties. Indeed, it is the leading success of translation of biophotonics science into clinical practice. Significant effort is being made to provide sufficient evidence for efficacy across a broad range of applications, but more needs to be done to radically reduce the cost of OCT so that it can spread to underserved markets and address new, fast growing opportunities in mobile health monitoring. Currently, a clinical OCT system ranges in price from ∼$50k to ∼$150k, typically is housed on a bedside trolley, runs off AC power, and requires skilled, extensively trained technicians to operate. The cost, size, and skill level required keep this wonderful technology beyond the reach of mainstream primary care, much less individual consumers seeking to monitor their health on a routine basis outside of typical clinical settings and major urban medical centers. Beyond the first world market, there are 6.5 billion people with similar eye and skin cancer care needs which cannot be met by the current generation of large, expensive, complex, and delicate OCT systems. This paper will describe a means to manufacture a low cost, compact, simple, and robust OCT system, using parts and a configuration similar to a CD-ROM or DVD pickup unit (see figure 1). Essentially, this system - multiple reference OCT (MR-OCT) - is based on the use of a partial mirror in the reference arm of a time domain OCT system to provide multiple references, and hence A-scans, at several depths simultaneously (see figure 2). We have already shown that a system based on this configuration can achieve an SNR of greater than 90 dB, which is sufficient for many medical imaging and biometry applications.

The traditional fetal biometric parameters, such as biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), femur length (FL), and abdominal circumference become increasingly unreliable for accurate gestational age estimation with advancing pregnancy, especially in 3rd trimester. This study was conducted to assess the role of fetal kidney length (KL) as an alternate parameter to assess gestational age in 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Aim: To assess relationship between sonographic gestational age and fetal KL between 18 and 39 weeks of gestation. Settings and design: Prospective, cross-sectional, single operator study conducted over a period of 1 year in a medical college hospital. Materials and methods: Three hundred singleton pregnant women between 18 and 39 weeks of gestation were subjected to antenatal ultrasound. In addition to routine fetal biometry, measurements of fetal KL were made by noting distance between upper and lower poles of each kidney on a sagittal section of the fetal abdomen. The right and left KLs were averaged to obtain a single value for the purpose of statistical analysis. Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis is done using SAS 9.2, SPSS 15.0, Stata 10.1, Med Calc 9.0.1, Systat 12.0, and R environment version 2.11.1. Fetal KL was expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Linear regression analysis was used to establish a relationship between sonographic gestational age in weeks and fetal KL. Level of significance was expressed as p value. Results: A strong statistical correlation was found between sonographic gestational age and fetal KL. Nomograms and growth curves were constructed to correlate gestational age with fetal KL. Conclusion: Fetal KL measurements can be used as alternate method of estimating gestational age in women with uncertain last menstrual periods (LMPs) and presenting late in the gestation for safe confinement. In fetal macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, short-limb dysplasias, and when fetal head is engaged, these measurements are valuable alternate parameters to assess gestational age since they are simple, not time-consuming, easy to identify, and measure. © 2016, Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd.
