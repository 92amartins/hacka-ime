The optimization strategy reduced the number of parameters from 34 to 31 because we removed some large terms that increased the required size of the quadrature grid and the number of self-consistent-field iterations. The mean unsigned error (MUE) of revM06-L on 422 chemical energies is 3.07 kcal/mol, which is improved from 3.57 kcal/mol calculated by M06-L. The MUE of revM06-L for the chemical reaction barrier height database (BH76) is 1.98 kcal/mol, which is improved by more than a factor of 2 with respect to the M06-L functional. The revM06-L functional gives the best result among local functionals tested for the noncovalent interaction database (NC51), with an MUE of only 0.36 kcal/mol, and the MUE of revM06-L for the solid-state lattice constant database (LC17) is half that for M06-L. The revM06-L functional also yields smoother potential curves, and it predicts more-accurate results than M06-L for seven out of eight diversified test sets not used for parameterization. We conclude that the revM06-L functional is well suited for a broad range of applications in chemistry and condensed-matter physics. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

This PES describes the global minimum, the cis-and trans-HCOH isomers, and barriers relevant to isomerization, formation of the molecular (H2+CO) and radical (H+HCO) products, and the loose so-called roaming transitionstate saddle point. The key features of the PES are reviewed and compared with a previous PES, denoted by PES04, based on five local fits that are 'stitched' together by switching functions (Zhang et al. 2004 J. Phys. Chem. A 108, 8980-8986 (doi:10.1021/ jp048339l)). Preliminary quasi-classical trajectory calculations are performed at the total energy of 36 233 cm?1 (103 kcal mol?1), relative to the H2CO global minimum, using the new PES, with a particular focus on roaming dynamics. When compared with the results from PES04, the new PES findings show similar rotational distributions, somewhat more roaming and substantially higher H2 vibrational excitation.","Kinetics; Quasi-classical trajectories; Roaming; RRKM theory; Unimolecular reactions"

We report high-level, coupled-mode anharmonic (VSCF/VCI) calculations of vibrational spectra of two protonated water clusters, H7O3+ and H9O4+, using the Watson Hamiltonian and new full-dimensional, high-level many-body potential energy and dipole moment surfaces. These many-body representations are first validated against direct CCSD(T)-F12b/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations of the double-harmonic spectra of these clusters. Then they are used with a 4-mode representation of the potential and 18 coupled modes to obtain the anharmonic coupled-mode spectra of these clusters. The calculated spectra agree well with recent Ar-tagged action spectra. In the case of H9O4+, a “side-by-side” comparison shows a very good agreement with virtually every experimental feature. © 2017 Author(s).",

This software update considers changes made to our programs during the course of the project to allow for such calculations. This update considers three programs: Duo which computed vibronic spectra for diatomics, DVR3D which computes rotation-vibration spectra for triatomics, and TROVE which computes rotation-vibration spectra for general polyatomic systems. Important updates in functionality include the calculation of quasibound (resonance) states and Landé g-factors by Duo and the calculation of resonance states by DVR3D. Significant algorithmic improvements are reported for both DVR3D and TROVE. All three programs are publically available from ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk.

The PES is based on explicitly correlated coupled cluster calculations with extrapolation to the complete basis set limit and incorporates a range of higher-level additive energy corrections. These include core-valence electron correlation, higher-order coupled cluster terms beyond perturbative triples, scalar relativistic effects, and the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. Sub-wavenumber accuracy is achieved for the majority of experimentally known vibrational energy levels with the four fundamentals of 12CH4 reproduced with a root-mean-square error of 0.70 cm-1. The computed ab initio equilibrium C-H bond length is in excellent agreement with previous values despite pure rotational energies displaying minor systematic errors as J (rotational excitation) increases.

The QD results indicate that both translational energy and the excitation of the CH stretching mode significantly promote the reaction while the excitation of the umbrella mode has a negligible effect on the reactivity. For this early barrier reaction, interestingly, the CH stretching mode is more effective than translational energy in promoting the reaction except at very low collision energies. These QD observations are supported by QCT results. The higher efficacy of the CH stretching model in promoting this early barrier reaction is inconsistent with the prediction of the naively extended Polanyi's rules, but can be rationalized by the recently proposed sudden vector projection model. © 2016 Author(s).",

Here, we present a new local exchange-correlation functional called MN15-L that predicts accurate results for a broad range of molecular and solid-state properties including main-group bond energies, transition metal bond energies, reaction barrier heights, noncovalent interactions, atomic excitation energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, total atomic energies, hydrocarbon thermochemistry, and lattice constants of solids. The MN15-L functional has the same mathematical form as a previous meta-nonseparable gradient approximation exchange-correlation functional, MN12-L, but it is improved because we optimized it against a larger database, designated 2015A, and included smoothness restraints; the optimization has a much better representation of transition metals. The mean unsigned error on 422 chemical energies is 2.32 kcal/mol, which is the best among all tested functionals, with or without nonlocal exchange. The MN15-L functional also provides good results for test sets that are outside the training set. A key issue is that the functional is local (no nonlocal exchange or nonlocal correlation), which makes it relatively economical for treating large and complex systems and solids. Another key advantage is that medium-range correlation energy is built in so that one does not need to add damped dispersion by molecular mechanics in order to predict accurate noncovalent binding energies. We believe that the MN15-L functional should be useful for a wide variety of applications in chemistry, physics, materials science, and molecular biology. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",

In order to obtain the energies needed for fitting analytic surfaces, we carried out multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) calculations based on wave functions obtained from state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field calculations for 2280 geometries for the three lowest 3A″ states and for 2298 geometries for the three lowest 3A′ states. The lowest-energy 3A′ and 3A″ states at each of these geometries were then improved by applying the dynamically scaled external correlation (DSEC) method to all MRCI points, and the resulting DSEC energies were used for construction of the ground-state PES for each symmetry. The many-body component of the DSEC energies for the three-dimensional 3A′ and 3A″ PESs was then least-squares fitted in terms of permutationally invariant polynomials in mixed exponential-Gaussian bond order variables. The global and local minima as well as the transition structures of both the 3A′ and the 3A″ analytic PES were explored. In agreement with previous work, we find that the reverse reaction is barrierless on the 3A″ surface along the minimum energy pathway. However, we have explored several new local minima and transition structures on the 3A′ PES. Furthermore, based on the newly found minima and transition structures, two independent reaction mechanisms have been illustrated for the reaction path on the 3A′ PES.

A new R-matrix formalism is presented for tackling problems involving low- and ultra-low energy collisions. This general formalism is particularly appropriate for slow collisions occurring on potential energy surfaces with deep wells. The many resonance states make such systems hard to treat theoretically but offer the best prospects for novel physics: resonances are already being widely used to control diatomic systems and should provide the route to steering ultracold reactions. Our R-matrix-based formalism builds on the progress made in variational calculations of molecular spectra by using these methods to provide wavefunctions for the whole system at short internuclear distances, (a regime known as the inner region). These wavefunctions are used to construct collision energy-dependent R-matrices which can then be propagated to give cross sections at each collision energy. The method is formulated for ultracold collision systems with differing numbers of atoms. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",

Nitromethane has 15 vibrational degrees of freedom, including one that is a nearly free internal methyl torsion, which is accurately described by the PES. This torsional mode makes vibrational calculations very challenging and here we present the results of calculations without it. Nevertheless, 14-mode calculations are still challenging and can lead to very large Hamiltonian matrices. To address this issue, we apply a pruning scheme, suggested previously by Handy and Carter, that reduces the size of matrix without sacrificing accuracy in the eigenvalues. The method is briefly described here in the context of partitioning theory. A new and more efficient implementation of it, coded in the latest version of MULTIMODE program, is described.

We also present two extensions of our importance sampling and stratified sampling schemes for calculating vibrational-rotational partition functions by the FPI method. The first is the use of importance functions for dihedral angles between sets of generalized Jacobi coordinate vectors. The second is an extension of our stratification scheme to allow some strata to be defined based only on coordinate information while other strata are defined based on both the geometry and the energy of the centroid of the Feynman path. These enhanced methods are applied to calculate converged partition functions by FPI methods, and these results are compared to ones obtained earlier by vibrational configuration interaction (VCI) calculations, both calculations being for the Jordan-Gilbert potential energy surface. The earlier VCI calculations are found to agree well (within ∼1.5%) with the new benchmarks. The FPI partition functions presented here are estimated to be converged to within a 2σ statistical uncertainty of between 0.04% and 0.07% for the given potential energy surface for temperatures in the range 300-3000 K and are the most accurately converged partition functions for a given potential energy surface for any molecule with five or more atoms.

These observations underscore the transition-state control of the reaction dynamics, as both the H2O rotational and HF vibrational modes are strongly coupled to the reaction coordinate at the transition state.

The simulations used a new potential energy surface for the N<inf>4</inf> system; the surface is an improved version of one that was presented previously. In the QCT calculations, initial conditions were determined based on a two-temperature model that approximately separates the translational-rotational temperature from the vibrational temperature of the N<inf>2</inf> diatoms. Five values from 8000 K to 30 000 K were considered for each of the two temperatures. Over 2.4 × 109 trajectories were calculated. We present results for ensemble-averaged dissociation rate constants as functions of the translational-rotational temperature T and the vibrational temperature T<inf>v</inf>. The rate constant depends more strongly on T when T<inf>v</inf> is low, and it depends more strongly on T<inf>v</inf> when T is low. Quasibound reactant states contribute significantly to the rate constants, as do exchange processes at higher temperatures. We discuss two sets of runs in detail: an equilibrium test set in which T = T<inf>v</inf> and a nonequilibrium test set in which T<inf>v</inf> < T. In the equilibrium test set, high-v and moderately-low-j molecules contribute most significantly to the overall dissociation rate, and this state specificity becomes stronger as the temperature decreases. Dissociating trajectories tend to result in a major loss of vibrational energy and a minor loss of rotational energy. In the nonequilibrium test set, as T<inf>v</inf> decreases while T is fixed, higher-j molecules contribute more significantly to the dissociation rate, dissociating trajectories tend to result in a greater rotational energy loss, and the dissociation probability's dependence on v weakens. In this way, as T<inf>v</inf> decreases, rotational energy appears to compensate for the decline in average vibrational energy in promoting dissociation. In both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium test sets, in every case, the average total internal energy loss in the dissociating trajectories is between 10.2 and 11.0 eV, slightly larger than the equilibrium potential energy change of N<inf>2</inf> dissociation. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",

The well-documented inadequacies of the Voigt profile (VP), used almost universally by databases and radiative-transfer codes, to represent pressure effects and Doppler broadening in isolated vibrationalrotational and pure rotational transitions of the water molecule have resulted in the development of a variety of alternative line-profile models. These models capture more of the physics of the influence of pressure on line shapes but, in general, at the price of greater complexity. The Task Group recommends that the partially Correlated quadratic-Speed-Dependent Hard-Collision profile (pCqSD-HCP) should be adopted as the appropriate model for high-resolution spectroscopy. For simplicity this should be called the Hartmann-Tran profile (HTP). The HTP is sophisticated enough to capture the various collisional contributions to the isolated line shape, can be computed in a straightforward and rapid manner, and reduces to simpler profiles, including the Voigt profile, under certain simplifying assumptions. © 2014 IUPAC & De Gruyter.","High-resolution spectroscopy; Iupac physical and biophysical chemistry division; Line profiles; Line shifts; Water vapor"

Interest in this ubiquitous bond has led to several prototypical systems emerging to studying its behavior. Hydrogen chloride clusters stand as one such example. We present here a new many-body potential energy surface for (HCl)n constructed from one-, two-, and three-body interactions. The surface is constructed from previous highly accurate, semiempirical monomer and dimer surfaces, and a new high-level ab initio permutationally invariant full-dimensional three-body potential. The new three-body potential is based on fitting roughly 52 000 three-body energies computed using coupled cluster with single, doubles, perturbative triples, and explicit correlation and the augmented correlation consistent double-ζ basis set. The first application, described here, is to the ring HCl trimer, for which the many-body representation is exact. The new potential describes all known stationary points of the trimer as well its dissociation to either three monomers or a monomer and a dimer. The anharmonic vibrational energies are computed for the three H-Cl stretches, using explicit three-mode coupling calculations and local-monomer calculations with Hückel-type coupling. Both methods produce frequencies within 5 cm-1 of experiment. A wavepacket calculation based on the Hückel model and full-dimensional classical calculation are performed to study the monomer H-Cl stretch vibration-vibration transfer process in the ring HCl trimer. Somewhat surprisingly, the results of the quantum and classical calculations are virtually identical, both exhibiting coherent beating of the excitation between the three monomers. Finally, this representation of the potential is used to study properties of larger clusters, namely to compute optimized geometries of the tetramer, pentamer, and hexamer and to perform explicit four-mode coupling calculations of the tetramer's anharmonic stretch frequencies. The optimized geometries are found to be in agreement with those of previous ab initio studies and the tetramer's anharmonic frequencies are computed within 11 cm-1 of experiment.

To understand the mode specificity, the reaction dynamics was studied using both a reduced-dimensional quantum dynamical model and the conventional quasi-classical trajectory method, both of which reproduced qualitatively the measured enhancements. The mechanism of enhancement was analyzed using a Franck-Condon model and by inspecting trajectories. It is shown that the higher reactivity for higher J states of CHD3 with K = 0 can be attributed to the enlargement of the cone of acceptance. On the other hand, the less pronounced enhancement for the higher J = K states is apparently due to the fact that the rotation along the C-H bond is less effective in opening up the cone of acceptance. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.",

About 90 000 classical scattering simulations are performed in order to determine collision-induced changes in internal energy and in allyl rotational angular momentum. Dissociation is studied by means of about 50 000 additional trajectories evolved for the isolated allyl under three different conditions: allyl with no angular momentum (J = 0); allyl with the same microcanonically sampled initial conditions used for the collisions (J∗); allyl evolving from the corresponding exit conditions after the collision. The potential energy surface is the sum of an intramolecular potential and an interaction one, and it has already been used in a previous work on allyl-argon scattering (Conte, R.; Houston, P. L.; Bowman, J. M. J. Phys. Chem. A 2013, 117, 14028-14041). Energy transfer data show that increased initial rotation favors, on average, increased relaxation of the excited molecule. The availability of a high-level intramolecular potential energy surface permits us to study the dependence of energy transfer on the type of starting allyl isomer. A turning point analysis is presented, and highly efficient collisions are detected. Collision-induced variations in the allyl rotational angular momentum may be quite large and are found to be distributed according to three regimes. The roles of rotational angular momentum, collision, and type of isomer on allyl unimolecular dissociation are considered by looking at dissociations times, kinetic energies of the fragments, and branching ratios. Generally, rotational angular momentum has a strong influence on the dissociation dynamics, while the single collision and the type of starting isomer are less influential. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",

The objective of our work has been to design an xc functional with broad accuracy across as wide an expanse of chemistry and physics as possible, leading-as a long-range goal-to a functional with good accuracy for all problems, i.e. a universal functional. To guide our path towards that goal and to measure our progress, we have developed-building on earlier work of our group-a set of databases of reference data for a variety of energetic and structural properties in chemistry and physics. These databases include energies of molecular processes, such as atomization, complexation, proton addition and ionization; they also include molecular geometries and solid-state lattice constants, chemical reaction barrier heights, and cohesive energies and band gaps of solids. For this paper, we gather many of these databases into four comprehensive databases, two with 384 energetic data for chemistry and solid-state physics and another two with 68 structural data for chemistry and solid-state physics, and we test two wave function methods and 77 density functionals (12 Minnesota meta functionals and 65 others) in a consistent way across this same broad set of data. We especially highlight the Minnesota density functionals, but the results have broader implications in that one may see the successes and failures of many kinds of density functionals when they are all applied to the same data. Therefore, the results provide a status report on the quest for a universal functional. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The number of validated energy levels is 12269, 338, and 3351 for D216O, D217O, and D218O, respectively. The energy levels have been checked against the ones determined, with an average accuracy of about 0.03cm-1, from variational rovibrational computations employing exact kinetic energy operators and an accurate potential energy surface. Furthermore, the rovibrational labels of the energy levels have been validated by an analysis of the computed wavefunctions using the rigid-rotor decomposition (RRD) scheme. The extensive list of MARVEL lines and levels obtained is deposited in the Supplementary Material of this paper, in a distributed information system applied to water, W at DIS, and on the official MARVEL website, where they can easily be retrieved. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Atmospheric physics; Energy levels; Spectroscopic information system; Transition wavenumbers; Water vapor"

The empirical model providing the line positions involves an effective, Watsonian-type rotational Hamiltonian with literature parameter values resulting from least-squares fittings to observed transition frequencies. The formation of so-called 6-fold rotational energy clusters at high rotational excitation are investigated. The SO3 molecule is planar at equilibrium and exhibits a unique type of rotational-energy clustering associated with unusual stabilization axes perpendicular to the S-O bonds.

The program package also includes seven utility codes that can be used as stand-alone programs to calculate reduced moment of inertia matrices by the method of Kilpatrick and Pitzer, to generate conformational structures, to calculate, either analytically or by Monte Carlo sampling, volumes for torsional subdomains defined by Voronoi tessellation of the conformational subspace, to generate template input files for the MSTor calculation and Voronoi calculation, and to calculate one-dimensional torsional partition functions using the torsional eigenvalue summation method.

Phys. Comm. 183 (2012) 1803 Classification: 16.3, 16.12, 23. Does the new version supercede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Calculation of the partition functions and thermodynamic functions (standard-state energy, enthalpy, entropy, and free energy as functions of temperature) of complex molecules involving multiple torsional motions. Solution method: The multi-structural approximation with torsional anharmonicity (MS-T). The program also provides results for the multi-structural local harmonic approximation. Reasons for new version: We implemented the newly developed MS-T method based on a coupled torsional potential, which is called the MS-T(C) method. It has been shown to be more accurate than the original MS-T method, i.e., the MS-T(U) method, based on an uncoupled torsional potential. We simplified the input files and improved our utility codes to make the MSTor package easier to use. Summary of revisions: 1. We added the MS-T method based on a coupled torsional potential, which is called MS-T(C), where C denotes coupled. The original method that is based on an uncoupled potential is called MS-T(U).2. The capability of treating linear bending motions is added.3. Definitions of frames and frame chains are no longer needed in the input file.4. The code symmetry is added to determine the group symmetry of a structure.5. The mvinput.exe utility program is added to generate the input file for the vorm.exe and/or mcvorm.exe codes. The msinput.exe utility code had been modified to write the local periodicities taken from the mvorm.out file. Both mvinput.exe and msinput.exe use the symmetry.exe program to determine the point group of each structure.6. The ConfGen.exe has been completely rewritten in Fortran 90, and it reads new fields corresponding to the Gaussian input keywords.7. We corrected a bug in which an array was not initialized.Restrictions: There is no limit on the number of torsions that can be included in either the Voronoi calculation or the full MS-T calculation. In practice, the range of problems that can be addressed with the present method consists of all multitorsional problems for which one can afford to calculate all the conformational structures and their frequencies. Unusual features: The method can be applied to transition states as well as stable molecules. The program package also includes the hull program for the calculation of Voronoi volumes, the symmetry program for determining point group symmetry of a molecule, and seven utility codes that can be used as stand-alone programs to calculate reduced moment-of-inertia matrices by the method of Kilpatrick and Pitzer, to generate conformational structures, to calculate, either analytically or by Monte Carlo sampling, volumes of the torsional subdomains defined by Voronoi tessellation of the conformational subspace, to generate template input files, and to calculate one-dimensional torsional partition functions using the torsional eigenvalue summation method. Additional comments: The program package includes a manual, installation script, and input and output files for a test suite. Running time: There are 26 test runs. The running time of the test runs on a single processor of the Itasca computer is less than 2 s.

The surface describes the complex and dissociated monomers with a total RMS fitting error of 24 cm-1. The normal modes of the minima, low-energy saddle point and separated monomers, the double minimum isomerization pathway and electronic dissociation energy are accurately described by the surface. Rigorous quantum mechanical diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations are performed to determine the zero-point energy and wavefunction of the complex and the separated fragments. The calculated zero-point energies together with a De value calculated from CCSD(T) with a complete basis set extrapolation gives a D0 value of 1348 ± 3 cm-1, in good agreement with the recent experimentally reported value of 1334 ± 10 cm-1 B.

We consider hydrogen abstraction from four carbon sites of butanal (carbonyl-C, α-C, β-C and γ-C) by hydroperoxyl radical. We employed multi-structural variational transition state theory for studying the first three channels; this uses a multi-faceted dividing surface and allows us to include the contributions of multiple structures of both reacting species and transition states. Multi-configurational Shepard interpolation (MCSI) was used to obtain the geometries and energies of the potential energy surface along the minimum-energy paths, with gradients and Hessians calculated by the M08-HX/maug-cc-pVTZ method. We find the numbers of structures obtained for the transition states are 46, 60, 72 and 76respectively for the H abstraction at the carbonyl C, the α position, the β position and the γ position. Our results show that neglecting the factors arising from multiple structures and torsional anharmonicity would lead to errors at 300, 1000 and 2400 K of factors of 8, 11 and 10 for abstraction at the carbonyl-O, 2, 11 and 25 at the α-C position, 2, 23 and 47 at the β-C position, and 0.6, 8 and 18 at the γ-C position. The errors would be even larger at high temperature for the reverse of the H abstraction at the β-C.

The results indicate that torsional anharmonicity is very important at higher temperatures, and neglecting it would lead to errors of 26 and 32 at 1000 and 1500 K, respectively. Our results for the sums of the site-specific rate constants agree very well with the experimental values of Hanson and co-workers at 896-1269 K and with the experimental results of Campbell et al. at 292 K, but slightly less well with the experiments of Wallington et al., Nelson et al., and Yujing and Mellouki at 253-372 K; nevertheless, the calculated rates are within a factor of 1.61 of all experimental values at all temperatures. This gives us confidence in the site-specific values, which are currently inaccessible to experiment. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",

This reaction poses great challenges for theory and experiment, owing to the ruggedness and high dimensionality of these potentials, as well as the long lifetimes of the collision complexes. Crossed molecular beam (CMB) scattering experiments with soft electron ionization detection are used to disentangle the dynamics of this polyatomic multichannel reaction at a collision energy Ec of 8.4 kcal/mol. Five different primary products have been identified and characterized, which correspond to the five exothermic competing channels leading to H + CH2CHO, H + CH3CO, CH3 + HCO, CH2 + H2CO, and H2 + CH2CO. These experiments extend our previous CMB work at higher collision energy (Ec ∼ 13 kcal/mol) and when the results are combined with the literature branching ratios from kinetics experiments at room temperature (Ec ∼ 1 kcal/mol), permit to explore the variation of the branching ratios over a wide range of collision energies. In a synergistic fashion, full-dimensional, QCT surface hopping calculations of the O( 3P) + C2H4 reaction using ab initio PESs for the singlet and triplet states and their coupling, are reported at collision energies corresponding to the CMB and the kinetics ones. Both theory and experiment find almost an equal contribution from the triplet and singlet surfaces to the reaction, as seen from the collision energy dependence of branching ratios of product channels and extent of intersystem crossing (ISC). Further detailed comparisons at the level of angular distributions and translational energy distributions are made between theory and experiment for the three primary radical channel products, H + CH2CHO, CH 3 + HCO, and CH2 + H2CO. The very good agreement between theory and experiment indicates that QCT surface-hopping calculations, using reliable coupled multidimensional PESs, can yield accurate dynamical information for polyatomic multichannel reactions in which ISC plays an important role. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.",

To compose such formulas in a reasonably understandable fashion, a new notation is developed that is a generalization of that which has been used previously for similar purposes. The notation developed leads to easily programmable and reasonably understandable arbitrary order formulas, yet it is powerful enough to express the arbitrary order B tensor of a general, N-point internal coordinate, as is done herein. The techniques employed in the derivation of such formulas are relatively straightforward, and could presumably be applied to a number of other internal coordinates as needed. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.",

The theory is applied to calculate the cross sections and thermal rate constants for spin relaxation in low-temperature collisions of the prototypical organic molecule methylene [CH 2(X̃3B 1)] with He atoms.

Deriving properties from the density cumulant naturally yields methods that are size extensive and size consistent. In this work, we derive expressions for the analytic gradient, with respect to an external perturbation, for the DCFT-06 variant of density cumulant functional theory. Despite the fact that the DCFT-06 energy functional is stationary with respect to the density cumulant, the analytic gradients of the energy require the solution of perturbation-independent equations for both orbital and cumulant response. These two sets of linear response equations are coupled in nature and are solved iteratively with the solution of orbital and cumulant response equations each macroiteration, exhibiting rapid convergence. The gradients are implemented and benchmarked against coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD) and CCSD with perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)], as well as accurate empirically corrected experimental data, for a test set comprising 15 small molecules. For most of the test cases, results from DCFT-06 are closer to CCSD(T) and empirical data than those from CCSD.

The details of these outcomes are presented and correlated with the collision lifetime. Large energy transfer is found via complex formation, which can subsequently decay back to reactants, a non-reactive event, or to new products, a reactive event.

The conventional symmetric and asymmetric perturbative triples corrections [(T) and (T) Λ] are implemented, the latter one for the first time. Additionally, two new triples corrections, denoted as OD(Λ) and OD(Λ) T, are introduced. We applied the new methods to potential energy surfaces of the BH, HF, C 2, N 2, and CH 4 molecules, and compare the errors in total energies, with respect to full configuration interaction, with those from the standard coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD), with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)], and asymmetric triples correction (CCSD(T) Λ) methods. The CCSD(T) method fails badly at stretched geometries, the corresponding nonparallelity error is 7-281 kcal mol -1, although it gives reliable results near equilibrium geometries. The new symmetric triples correction, CCSD(Λ), noticeably improves upon CCSD(T) (by 4-14 kcal mol -1) for BH, HF, and CH 4; however, its performance is worse than CCSD(T) (by 1.6-4.2 kcal mol -1) for C 2 and N 2. The asymmetric triples corrections, CCSD(T) Λ and CCSD(Λ) T, perform remarkably better than CCSD(T) (by 5-18 kcal mol -1) for the BH, HF, and CH 4 molecules, while for C 2 and N 2 their results are similar to those of CCSD(T). Although the performance of CCSD and OD is similar, the situation is significantly different in the case of triples corrections, especially at stretched geometries. The OD(T) method improves upon CCSD(T) by 1-279 kcal mol -1. The new symmetric triples correction, OD(Λ), enhances the OD(T) results (by 0.01-2.0 kcal mol -1) for BH, HF, and CH 4; however, its performance is worse than OD(T) (by 1.9-2.3 kcal mol -1) for C 2 and N 2. The asymmetric triples corrections, OD(T) Λ and OD(Λ) T, perform better than OD(T) (by 2.0-6.2 kcal mol -1). The latter method is slightly better for the BH, HF, and CH 4 molecules. However, for C 2 and N 2 the new results are similar to those of OD(T). For the BH, HF, and CH 4 molecules, OD(Λ) T provides the best potential energy curves among the considered methods, while for C 2 and N 2 the OD(T) method prevails. Hence, for single-bond breaking the OD(Λ) T method appears to be superior, whereas for multiple-bond breaking the OD(T) method is better. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.",

The underlying Born-Oppenheimer electronic structure computations used optimized explicitly correlated shifted Gaussian functions. The surfaces include diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections computed from the accurate electronic wave functions. A fit to the 41 655 ab initio points is presented which gives a standard deviation better than 0.1cm -1 when restricted to the points up to 6000cm -1 above the first dissociation asymptote. Nuclear motion calculations utilizing this PES, called GLH3P, and an exact kinetic energy operator given in orthogonal internal coordinates are presented. The ro-vibrational transition frequencies for H3+, H 2D, and HD2+ are compared with high resolution measurements. The most sophisticated and complete procedure employed to compute ro-vibrational energy levels, which makes explicit allowance for the inclusion of non-adiabatic effects, reproduces all the known ro-vibrational levels of the H3+ isotopologues considered to better than 0.2cm -1. This represents a significant (order-of-magnitude) improvement compared to previous studies of transitions in the visible. Careful treatment of linear geometries is important for high frequency transitions and leads to new assignments for some of the previously observed lines. Prospects for further investigations of non-adiabatic effects in the H3+ isotopologues are discussed. In short, the paper presents (a) an extremely accurate global potential energy surface of H3+ resulting from high accuracy ab initio computations and global fit, (b) very accurate nuclear motion calculations of all available experimental line data up to 16 000cm -1, and (c) results suggest that we can predict accurately the lines of H3+ towards dissociation and thus facilitate their experimental observation. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.",

Anharmonic zero-point vibrational energies, diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections, relativistic effects, and core correlation corrections are also taken into account.

Ground-state CN(X 2+) molecules were generated by pulsed 266-nm laser photolysis of ICN in a thermal (nominally 298 K) bath of the Ar collision partner at a range of pressures. The translationally thermalized CN(X) radicals were optically pumped to selected unique CN(A 2, v 4, j 2.5, 3.5, 6.5, 11.5, 13.5, and 18.5, F 1e) levels on the A-X (4,0) band by a pulsed tunable dye laser. The prepared level was monitored in a collinear geometry by cw frequency-modulated (FM) spectroscopy in stimulated emission on the CN(A-X) (4,2) band. The FM lineshapes for co- and counter-rotating circular pump and probe polarizations were analyzed to extract the time dependence of the population and (to a good approximation) orientation (tensor rank K 1 polarization). The corresponding parallel and perpendicular linear polarizations yielded population and alignment (K 2). The combined population and polarization measurements at each Ar pressure were fitted to a 3-level kinetic model, the minimum complexity necessary to reproduce the qualitative features of the data. Rate constants were extracted for the total loss of population and of elastic depolarization of ranks K 1 and 2. Elastic depolarization is concluded to be a relatively minor process in this system. Complementary full quantum scattering (QS) calculations were carried out on the best previous and a new set of ab initio potential energy surfaces for CN(A)-Ar. Collision-energy-dependent elastic tensor and depolarization cross sections for ranks K 1 and 2 were computed for CN(A 2, v 4, j 1.5-10.5, F 1e) rotationalfine-structure levels. In addition, integral cross sections for rotationally inelastic transitions out of these levels were computed and summed to yield total population transfer cross sections. These quantities were integrated over a thermal collision-energy distribution to yield the corresponding rate constants. A complete master-equation simulation using the QS results for the selected initial level j 6.5 gave close, but not perfect, agreement with the near-exponential experimental population decays, and successfully reproduced the observed multimodal character of the polarization decays. On average, the QS population removal rate constants were consistently 10-15 higher than those derived from the 3-level fit to the experimental data. The QS and experimental depolarization rate constants agree within the experimental uncertainties at low j, but the QS predictions decline more rapidly with j than the observations. In addition to providing a sensitive test of the achievable level of agreement between state-of-the art experiment and theory, these results highlight the importance of multiple collisions in contributing to phenomenological depolarization using any method sensitive to both polarized and unpolarized molecules in the observed level. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.",

Its analysis shows that the transition states for OH bond fission and isomerization are both very close in energy to the excited vibrational levels reached in recent experiments and involve significant geometry changes relative to the CH 2OH equilibrium structure. The energies of key stationary points are refined using high-level electronic structure calculations. Vibrational energies and wavefunctions are computed by coupled anharmonic vibrational calculations. They show that high OH-stretch overtones are mixed with other modes. Consequently, trajectory calculations carried out at energies about ∼3000 cm -1 above the barriers reveal that despite initial excitation of the OH stretch, the direct OH bond fission is relatively slow (10 ps) and a considerable fraction of the radicals undergoes isomerization to the methoxy radical.

The next logical step is the characterization of these new worlds. What is their nature? Why are they as they are? Use of the Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope to probe the atmospheres of transiting hot, gaseous exoplanets has opened perspectives unimaginable even just 10 years ago, demonstrating that it is indeed possible with current technology to address the ambitious goal of characterizing the atmospheres of these alien worlds. However, these successful measurements have also shown the difficulty of understanding the physics and chemistry of these exotic environments when having to rely on a limited number of observations performed on a handful of objects. To progress substantially in this field, a dedicated facility for exoplanet characterization, able to observe a statistically significant number of planets over time and a broad spectral range will be essential. Additionally, the instrument design (e.g., detector performances, photometric stability) will be tailored to optimize the extraction of the astrophysical signal.

This validates the accuracy of the electronic structure calculations when combined with the MS-T method for estimating the thermodynamic properties of systems with multiple torsions, and it increases our confidence in the predictions made with this method for molecules and temperatures where experimental or empirical data are not available. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.",

Quantum dynamical calculations carried out using the Chebyshev propagator yield absorption spectra, product state distributions, branching ratios, and differential cross sections, which are in reasonably good agreement with the latest experimental results. Particular focus is placed here on the dependence of various dynamical observables on the photon energy. Detailed analyses of the dynamics have assigned the diffuse structure in absorption spectrum to short-time recurring dynamics near the HOH conical intersection. The non-adiabatic dissociation to the ground state OH product via the HOH conical intersection is facile, direct, fast, and produces rotationally hot OH(X∼) products. On the other hand, the adiabatic channel on the excited state leading to the OH(A∼) product is dominated by long-lived resonances, which depend sensitively on the potential energy surfaces. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.",

Phys. 130(17), 174301 (2009) and independently, directly calculated reaction paths. The PES is a multidimensional fit to coupled cluster single and double and perturbative treatment of triple excitations coupled-cluster single double triple (CCSD(T)) with the augmented correlation consistent triple zeta basis set (aug-cc-pVTZ). The reaction path potentials are obtained from a series of CCSD(T)aug-cc-pVnTZ calculations extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. Approximate 1D calculations of the tunneling splitting for these 1,2-H atom migrations are obtained using each of these potentials as well as quite different 1D Hamiltonians. The splittings are calculated over a large energy ranges, with results from the two sets of calculations in excellent agreement. Though negligibly slow (&gt;1 s) for the vibrational ground state, this work predicts tunneling-promoted 1,2 hydride shift dynamics in vinyl to exhibit exponential growth with internal vibrational excitation, specifically achieving rates on the sub-μs time scale at energies above E ≈ 7500 cm -1. Most importantly, these results begin to elucidate the possible role of quantum isomerization through barriers without dissociation, in competition with the more conventional picture of classical roaming permitted over a much narrower window of energies immediately below the bond dissociation limit. Furthermore, when integrated over a Boltzmann distribution of thermal energies, these microcanonical tunneling rates are consistent with sub-μs time scales for 1,2 hydride shift dynamics at T &gt; 1400 K. These results have potential relevance for combustion modeling of low-pressure flames, as well as recent observations of nuclear spin statistical mixing from high-resolution IRmicrowave spectroscopy on vinyl radical. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.",

This is accompanied by a transition to a second kind of bending mode called counter-rotator, again at lower energies and quantum numbers than in HCCH. These transitions are also investigated using bifurcation analysis of two empirical spectroscopic fitting Hamiltonians for pure bending modes, which helps to understand the origin of the transitions semiclassically as branchings or bifurcations out of the trans- and cis-normal bend modes when the latter become dynamically unstable.

Low-orders of SAPT (here, SAPT0) are especially attractive since they provide qualitative (sometimes quantitative) results while remaining tractable for large systems. The application of density fitting and Laplace transformation techniques to SAPT0 can significantly reduce the expense associated with these computations and make even larger systems accessible. We present new factorizations of the SAPT0 equations with density-fitted two-electron integrals and the first application of Laplace transformations of energy denominators to SAPT. The improved scalability of the DF-SAPT0 implementation allows it to be applied to systems with more than 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions. The Laplace-transformed energy denominators are compared to analogous partial Cholesky decompositions of the energy denominator tensor. Application of our new DF-SAPT0 program to the intercalation of DNA by proflavine has allowed us to determine the nature of the proflavine-DNA interaction. Overall, the proflavine-DNA interaction contains important contributions from both electrostatics and dispersion. The energetics of the intercalator interaction are are dominated by the stacking interactions (two-thirds of the total), but contain important contributions from the intercalator-backbone interactions. It is hypothesized that the geometry of the complex will be determined by the interactions of the intercalator with the backbone, because by shifting toward one side of the backbone, the intercalator can form two long hydrogen-bonding type interactions. The long-range interactions between the intercalator and the next-nearest base pairs appear to be negligible, justifying the use of truncated DNA models in computational studies of intercalation interaction energies. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.",

MS-VTST uses a multi-faceted dividing surface and provides a convenient way to include the contributions of many structures (typically conformers) of the reactant and the transition state in rate constant calculations. In this particular application, we also account for the torsional anharmonicity. We used the multi-configuration Shepard interpolation method to efficiently generate a semi-global portion of the potential energy surface from a small number of high-level electronic structure calculations using the M06 density functional in order to compute the energies and Hessians of Shepard points along a reaction path. The M06-2X density functional was used to calculate the multi-structural anharmonicity effect, including all of the structures of the reactant, product and transition state. To predict the thermal rate constant, VTST calculations were performed to obtain the canonical variational rate constant over the temperature range 200-2000 K. A transmission coefficient is calculated by the multidimensional small-curvature tunneling (SCT) approximation. The final MS-CVT/SCT thermal rate constant was determined by combining a reaction rate calculation in the single-structural harmonic oscillator approximation (including tunneling) with the multi-structural anharmonicity torsional factor. The calculated forward rate constant agrees very well with experimentally-based evaluations of the high-pressure limit for the temperature range 300-1300 K, although it is a factor of 2.5-3.0 lower than the single-structural harmonic oscillator approximation over this temperature range. We anticipate that MS-VTST will be generally useful for calculating the reaction rates of complex molecules with multiple torsions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.",

Here we present a method for including charge transfer between molecular fragments in the explicit polarization (X-Pol) fragment method for calculating potential energy surfaces. In the conventional X-Pol method, the total charge of each fragment is preserved, and charge transfer between fragments is not allowed. The description of charge transfer is made possible by treating each fragment as an open system with respect to the number of electrons. To achieve this, we applied Mermins finite temperature method to the X-Pol wave function. In the application of this method to X-Pol, the fragments are open systems that partially equilibrate their number of electrons through a quasithermodynamics electron reservoir. The number of electrons in a given fragment can take a fractional value, and the electrons of each fragment obey the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The equilibrium state for the electrons is determined by electronegativity equalization with conservation of the total number of electrons. The amount of charge transfer is controlled by re-interpreting the temperature parameter in the Fermi-Dirac distribution function as a coupling strength parameter. We determined this coupling parameter so as to reproduce the charge transfer energy obtained by block localized energy decomposition analysis. We apply the new method to ten systems, and we show that it can yield reasonable approximations to potential energy profiles, to charge transfer stabilization energies, and to the direction and amount of charge transferred. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.",

The dissociation of CD3CHO is also studied, and both HOD+DCCD (D2CC) and D2O+DCCH products are formed from the same mechanisms as in the CH3CHO dissociation. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",

With the high stability of Spitzer, Hubble, and large ground-based telescopes the spectra of bright close-in massive planets can be obtained and species like water vapour, methane, carbon monoxide and dioxide have been detected. With transit science came the first tangible remote sensing of these planetary bodies and so one can start to extrapolate from what has been learnt from Solar System probes to what one might plan to learn about their faraway siblings. As we learn more about the atmospheres, surfaces and near-surfaces of these remote bodies, we will begin to build up a clearer picture of their construction, history and suitability for life. The Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory, EChO, will be the first dedicated mission to investigate the physics and chemistry of Exoplanetary Atmospheres. By characterising spectroscopically more bodies in different environments we will take detailed planetology out of the Solar System and into the Galaxy as a whole. EChO has now been selected by the European Space Agency to be assessed as one of four M3 mission candidates. © International Astronomical Union 2011.","Planetary systems; Planetary systems: formation; Planets and satellites: formation; Planets and satellites: general"

Shank, J. Chem. Phys. 130, 144314 (2009)]. The realism of the two transition states is assessed by comparing structures, energies, and harmonic frequencies obtained from the potential energy surface and new high-level ab initio calculations. The rate constant for the exchange is obtained using conventional transition state theory with a tunneling correction. We employ a one-dimensional approach for the tunneling calculations using a relaxed potential from the full-dimensional potential in the imaginary-frequency normal mode of the saddle point, Qim. The accuracy of this one-dimensional approach has been shown for the ground-state tunneling splittings for H and D-transfer in malonaldehyde and for the D+ H2 reaction [Y. Wang and J. M. Bowman, J. Chem. Phys. 129, 121103 (2008)]. This approach is applied to calculate the rate constant for the H2 O+ H2O exchange and also for H2 O+ D2 O→2HOD.

The method developed out of nuclear physics, where the effects of the inner region were simply parametrized, into atomic and molecular physics, where the full problem can be formulated and hopefully solved ab initio. In atomic physics R-matrix based procedures are the method of choice for the ab initio calculation of electron collision parameters. There has been a number of R-matrix procedures developed to treat the low-energy electron-molecule collision problem or particular aspects of this problem. These methods have been extended to both positron physics and the R-matrix treatment of vibrational motion. The physical basis of the R-matrix method as well as its theoretical formulation are presented. Various electron scattering models within an R-matrix formulation including static exchange, static exchange plus polarization and close coupling are described with reference to various computational implementations of the method; these are compared to similar models used within other scattering methods. The need for a balanced treatment of the target and continuum wave functions is emphasised. Extensions of close-coupling based models into the intermediate energy regime using pseudo-states is discussed, as is the adaptation of R-matrix methods to problems involving photons. The numerical realisation of the R-matrix method is based on the adaptation of quantum chemistry codes in the inner region and asymptotic electron-atom scattering programs in the outer region. Use of bound state codes in scattering calculations raises issues involving continuum basis sets, appropriate orbitals, integral evaluation, orthogonalization, Hamiltonian construction and diagonalization which need to be addressed. The algorithms developed to resolve these issues are described as are ones associated with the outer region where methods to characterize resonances have received particular attention.

Initial state selected reaction probabilities are presented for various initial rovibrational states. The ground state reaction probability shows no threshold for this reaction, in other words, this reaction can occur without an activation barrier. The vibrational excitation shows that the stretching motion of H+ -HD only has a small effect on the reaction probability; the vibrational excitation of HD in H2 D + hinders the reactivity. By contrast, rotational excitation of H+ -HD greatly enhances the reactivity with the reaction probability increased double or triple at high rotational states compared to the ground state. Reactive resonances, seen in all the initial state selected reaction probabilities, are also found in the integral cross section for the ground state of H2 D+ and H2.

MCSI, which is called multiconfiguration molecular mechanics (MCMM) in previous articles, is a semiautomated method designed for constructing full-dimensional PESs for subsequent dynamics calculations (classical trajectories, full quantum dynamics, or variational transition state theory with multidimensional tunneling). The MCSI method is based on Shepard interpolation of Taylor series expansions of the coupling term of a 2×2 electronically diabatic Hamiltonian matrix with the diagonal elements representing nonreactive analytical PESs for reactants and products. In contrast to the previously developed method, these expansions are truncated in the present version at the first order, and, therefore, no input of electronic structure Hessians is required. The accuracy of the interpolated energies is evaluated for two test reactions, namely, the reaction OH+ H2 → H2 O+H and the hydrogen atom abstraction from a model of α -tocopherol by methyl radical. The latter reaction involves 38 atoms and a 108-dimensional PES. The mean unsigned errors averaged over a wide range of representative nuclear configurations (corresponding to an energy range of 19.5 kcal/mol in the former case and 32 kcal/mol in the latter) are found to be within 1 kcal/mol for both reactions, based on 13 gradients in one case and 11 in the other. The gradient-based MCMM method can be applied for efficient representations of multidimensional PESs in cases where analytical electronic structure Hessians are too expensive or unavailable, and it provides new opportunities to employ high-level electronic structure calculations for dynamics at an affordable cost. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.",

The classical barrier height (10.6±0.2 kcal mol-1) and exothermicity (3.6±0.2 kcal mol-1) for the HN2 → N2 +H reaction are predicted by high level ab initio quantum mechanical methods [up to CCSDT(Q)]. Total energies are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit applying the focal point analysis. Zero-point vibrational energies are computed using fundamental (anharmonic) frequencies obtained from a quartic force field. Relativistic and diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections are also taken into account. The quantum mechanical barrier with these corrections is predicted to be 6.4±0.2 kcal mol-1 and the reaction exothermicity to be 8.8±0.2 kcal mol-1. The importance of these parameters for the thermal NOx decomposition (De-NOx) process is discussed. The unimolecular rate constant for dissociation of the HN2 molecule and its lifetime are estimated by canonical transition-state theory and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory. The lifetime of the HN2 molecule is here estimated to be 2.8× 10-10 s at room temperature. Our result is in marginal agreement with the latest experimental kinetic modeling studies (τ=1.5× 10 -8 s), albeit consistent with the very rough experimental upper limit (τ&lt;0.5 μs). For the dissociation reaction, kinetic isotope effects are investigated. Our analysis demonstrates that the DN2 molecule has a longer lifetime than the HN2 molecule. Thus, DN2 might be more readily identified experimentally. The ionization potential of the HN2 molecule is determined by analogous high level ab initio methods and focal point analysis. The adiabatic IP of HN2 is predicted to be 8.19±0.05 eV, in only fair agreement with the experimental upper limit of 7.92 eV deduced from sychrothon-radiation-based photoionization mass spectrometry. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.",

Recent laboratory experiments where noble gas cations are reacted with pyrimidine favored the formation of C3 H3 N+, but the molecular structure(s) of this fragment was not determined. Microscopic reversibility means that pyrimidine could form under interstellar conditions should the required C 3 H3 N+ reactant be detected in the ISM. Hence C3 H3 N+ could be a strong candidate for involvement in the formation of heterocyclic biomolecules such as pyrimidine in the ISM. In this study, we have investigated the low energy isomers of the acrylonitrile ion (C3 H3 N+) using density functional theory as well as high levels of ab initio theory, namely, the singles and doubles coupled-cluster theory that includes a perturbational correction for connected triple excitations, denoted as CCSD(T). An automated stochastic search procedure, Kick, has been employed to find isomers on the ground state doublet potential energy surface. Several new structures, along with all the previously reported minima, have been found. The global minimum H2 CCCNH+ is energetically much lower than either H 2 CC (H) CN+, the acrylonitrile ion, or HCC (H) NCH +, the most likely intermediate of the reaction between HCCH+ and HCN. These isomers are connected to the global minimum via several transition states and intermediates. The results indicate that not only the global minimum but also several higher energy isomers of the C3 H3 N + ion could be important in interstellar pyrimidine formation. The isomeric molecules have the necessary CCNC backbone needed for the reaction with HCN to form the cyclic pyrimidine framework. The structural and rotational parameters of all the isomers studied in this work have been predicted at the CCSD(T) level of theory with the anticipation that it will expedite their laboratory as well as astronomical identification. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.",

The three-body potential is a fit, reported here, to roughly 30,000 intrinsic three-body energies obtained with second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and using the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set (avtz). The one- and two-body potentials are from an ab initio water dimer potential [Shank, J. Chem. Phys. 130, 144314 (2009)]. The predictive accuracy of the PES is demonstrated for the water trimer, tetramer, and hexamer by comparing the energies and harmonic frequencies obtained from the PES and new high level ab initio calculations at the respective global minima. The DMS is constructed from one- and two-body dipole moments, based on fits to MP2/avtz dipole moments. It is shown to be very accurate for the hexamer by comparison with direct calculations of the hexamer dipole.

In these computations the aug-cc-p(C)VXZ [X = 2(D), 3(T), 4(Q), 5, and 6] correlation-consistent Gaussian basis sets for C and O were used in conjunction with the corresponding aug-cc-pVXZ (X = 2-6) sets for H. The basis set limit values have been confirmed via explicitly correlated computations. Our FPA study supersedes previous computational work for the proton affinity and to some extent the enthalpy of formation of formaldehyde by accounting for (a) electron correlation beyond the ""gold standard"" CCSD(T) level; (b) the non-additivity of core electron correlation effects; (c) scalar relativity; (d) diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections computed at a correlated level; (e) anharmonicity of zero-point vibrational energies, based on global potential energy surfaces and variational vibrational computations; and (f) thermal corrections to enthalpies by direct summation over rovibrational energy levels.

The present assignment agrees well with high-level coupled cluster calculations of the HSCS+ structure, which, like earlier work, predict this isomer to be the ground state on the HCS2+ potential energy surface; HCSS+, an isomer with C2v symmetry, is predicted to lie more than 20 kcal/mol higher in energy. Other properties of HSCS+ including its dipole moment, anharmonic vibrational frequencies, and infrared intensities have also been computed at the coupled cluster level of theory with large basis sets. Because carbon disulfide possesses a fairly large proton affinity, and because this nonpolar molecule may plausibly exist in astronomical sources, HSCS+ is a good candidate for detection with radio telescopes in the submillimeter band where the stronger b -type transitions of this protonated cation are predicted to lie. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.",

The predicted dynamics is mainly electronically nonadiabatic (that is, it produces ground electronic state amino radicals). The small probability of forming the excited-state amino radical is found, for low excitations, to increase with total energy and to be independent of whether the symmetric or antisymmetric stretch is excited; however some selectivity with respect to exciting the antisymmetric stretch is found when more than one quantum of excitation is added to the stretches, and more than 50% of the amino radical are found to be electronically excited when six quanta are placed in the antisymmetric stretch. These results are in contrast to the mechanism inferred in recent experimental work, where excitation of the antisymmetric stretch by a single quantum was found to produce significant amounts of excited-state products via adiabatic dissociation at total energies of about 7.0 eV. Both theory and experiment predict a broad range of translational energies for the departing H atoms when the symmetric stretch is excited, but the present simulations do not reproduce the experimental translational energy profiles when the antisymmetric stretch is excited. The sensitivity of the predicted results to several aspects of the calculation is considered in detail, and the analysis leads to insight into the nature of the dynamics that is responsible for mode selectivity. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.",

Quantum scattering calculations are most naturally based on the average (Vsum) and half-difference (Vdif) of these two PESs. When Vdif is neglected, the OH (X 2Π) -Ar depolarization cross sections are found to be significantly reduced in magnitude, while the NO (X 2Π) -Ar cross sections are relatively unaffected. In addition, treating the molecules as closed-shell 1∑ + species with a corresponding rotational level structure and using (Vsum) to model the PES, we predict depolarization cross sections which differ significantly from those based on full inclusion of the electronic degeneracy and fine structure of these 2Π molecules.

In the former case, reaction occurs on the lowest potential energy surface of A″2 symmetry, and, in the latter case, by reaction on the lowest potential energy surface of A′2 symmetry. We report new ab initio potential energy surfaces for both these states in the product and reactant regions necessary for application of the coupled-states, statistical method.

This allows the calculation of analytic gradients, a necessity for efficient molecular dynamics simulations.

There are two terms in the function that represents the dependence of the decoherence time on the system parameters; one represents decoherence due to the quantum time-energy uncertainty principle and the other represents a back reaction from the decoherent force on the classical trajectory. We particularly examine the question of whether the first term should dominate. Five one-dimensional two-state model systems that represent limits of multidimensional nonadiabatic dynamics are designed for testing mixed quantum-classical methods and for comparing semiclassical calculations with exact quantum calculations. Simulations are carried out with the semiclassical Ehrenfest method (SE), Tully's fewest switch version (TFS) of the trajectory surface hopping method, and the decay-of-mixing method with natural switching, coherent switching (CSDM), and coherent switching with reinitiation (CSDM-D). The CSDM method is demonstrated to be the most accurate method, and it has several desirable features: (i) It behaves like the representation-independent SE method in the strong nonadiabatic coupling regions; (ii) it behaves physically like the TFS method in noninteractive region; and (iii) the trajectories are continuous with continuous momenta. The CSDM method is also demonstrated to balance coherence well with decoherence, and the results are nearly independent of whether one uses the adiabatic or diabatic representation. The present results provide new insight into the formulation of a physically correct decoherence time to be used with the CSDM method for non-Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamic simulations. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",

The PES is a fit to 11 147 near basis-set-limit frozen-core CCSD(T) electronic energies. This surface properly describes the invariance of the potential with respect to all permutations of identical atoms. The saddle-point barrier for the H-atom transfer on the PES is 4.1 kcalmol, in excellent agreement with the reported ab initio value. Model one-dimensional and ""exact"" full-dimensional calculations of the splitting for H- and D-atom transfer are done using this PES. The tunneling splittings in full dimensionality are calculated using the unbiased ""fixed-node"" diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method in Cartesian and saddle-point normal coordinates. The ground-state tunneling splitting is found to be 21.6 cm-1 in Cartesian coordinates and 22.6 cm-1in normal coordinates, with an uncertainty of 2-3 cm-1. This splitting is also calculated based on a model which makes use of the exact single-well zero-point energy (ZPE) obtained with the MULTIMODE code and DMC ZPE and this calculation gives a tunneling splitting of 21-22 cm-1. The corresponding computed splittings for the D-atom transfer are 3.0, 3.1, and 2-3 cm-1. These calculated tunneling splittings agree with each other to within less than the standard uncertainties obtained with the DMC method used, which are between 2 and 3 cm-1, and agree well with the experimental values of 21.6 and 2.9 cm-1 for the H and D transfer, respectively. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",

Master equation kinetic models fitted to measured reaction rates place the concerted elimination barrier 3.0 kcal mol-1 below the C2 H5 + O2 reactants, whereas the best previous electronic structure computations yield a barrier more than 2.0 kcal mol-1 higher. We resolve this discrepancy here by means of the most rigorous computations to date, using focal point methods to converge on the ab initio limit. Explicit computations were executed with basis sets as large as cc-pV5Z and correlation treatments as extensive as coupled cluster through full triples with a perturbative inclusion of quadruple excitations [CCSDT(Q)]. The final predicted barrier is -3.0 kcal mol-1, bringing the concerted elimination mechanism into precise agreement with experiment.

The substantial increases in the electron affinity of dG:dC (by 0.50 eV for EAad and 0.23 eV for VEA) compared to those of the dC nucleoside suggest that electron attachment to DNA double helices should be energetically favored with respect to the single strands. Most importantly, electron attachment to the dC moiety in the dG:dC pair is found to be able to trigger the proton transfer in the dG: dC- pair, surprisingly resulting in the lower energy distonic anionic complex d (G-H)-:d (C+H). The negative charge for the latter system is located on the base of dC in the dG: dC- pair, while it is transferred to d(G-H) in d (G-H)-:d (C+H), accompanied by the proton transfer from N1(dG) to N3(dC). The low energy barrier (2.4 kcalmol) for proton transfer from dG to dC- suggests that the distonic d (G-H)-:d (C+H) pair should be one of the important intermediates in the process of electron attachment to DNA double helices.

By means of an adiabatic-bender analysis, we show that each of these peaks corresponds to the position of quasibound HF-H vibrational states trapped in the weak van der Waals well.

The experiments utilize a pump-probe scheme to determine the OH X Π2 population distribution following collisional quenching in a pulsed supersonic expansion. The pump laser excites OH A ∑+2 (′ =0, N′ =0), which has a significantly reduced fluorescence lifetime due to quenching by H2. The probe laser monitors the OH X Π2 (″, N″) population via laser-induced fluorescence on various A-X transitions under single collision conditions. The experiments reveal a high degree of rotational excitation (N″) of the quenched OH X Π2 products observed in ″ =1 and 2 as well as a pronounced propensity for quenching into the Π (A′) -doublet level. These experiments have been supplemented by extensive multireference, configuration-interaction calculations aimed at exploring the topology of the relevant potential energy surfaces. Electronic quenching of OH A ∑+2 by H2 proceeds through conical intersections between two potentials of A′ reflection symmetry (in planar geometry) that correlate with the electronically excited A ∑+2 and ground X Π2 states of OH. The conical intersections occur in high-symmetry geometries, in which the O side of OH points toward H2. Corroborating and extending earlier work of Hoffman and Yarkony [J. Chem. Phys. 113, 10091 (2000)], these calculations reveal a steep gradient away from the OH- H2 conical intersection as a function of both the OH orientation and interfragment distance. The former will give rise to a high degree of OH rotational excitation, as observed for the quenched OH X Π2 products. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.",

While the predicted vertical detachment energy (VDE) of the isolated cytosine is only 0.48 eV, it is predicted to increase to 1.27 eV for the lowest-lying pentahydrate of cytosine. The adiabatic electron affinity (AEA) of cytosine was also found to increase from 0.03 to 0.61 eV for the pentahydrate, implying that the cytosine anion, while questionable in the gas phase, is bound in aqueous solution. Both the VDE and AEA values for cytosine are smaller than those of uracil and thymine for a given hydration number.

These high-resolution measurements reveal the correlated internal state distribution in the H 2 cofragments. The results show that rotationally hot CO (j co - 45) is produced in conjunction with vibrationally ""cold"" H 2 fragments (u=0-5): these products are formed through the well-known skewed transition state and described in detail in the accompanying paper. After excitation of formaldehyde above the threshold for the radical channel (H 2CO→H+HCO) we also find formation of rotationally cold CO (j co=5-28) correlated to highly vibrationally excited H 2 (v = 6-8).

Thus any nonplanarity of the amino group may affect the molecular recognition of nucleic acids. Ab initio Hartree-Fock (HF) and second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) levels of theory have been used to obtain the equilibrium geometries of the Cl and Cs structures for five common nucleic acid bases. The energy barriers between the Cl and Cs structures have also been predicted. A series of correlation consistent basis sets up to cc-pCVQZ and aug-cc-pVQZ has been used to systematically study the dependence of the amino group nonplanarity. The equilibrium geometries of the nucleic acid bases with an amino group, including adenine, guanine, and cytosine, are examined carefully. At the MP2 level of theory, larger basis sets decrease the extent of nonplanarity of the amino group, but the decrease slows down when the QZ basis sets are used, demonstrating the intrinsic property of nonplanarity for guanine. For adenine and cytosine the situation is less clear; as the HF limit is approached, these two structures become planar. Addition of core correlation effects or diffuse functions further decreases the degree of nucleic acid base nonplanarity, in comparison to the original cc-pVXZ (X=D, T, and Q) basis sets. The aug-cc-pVXZ basis shows smaller degrees of nonplanarity than the cc-pCVXZ sets. The aug-cc-pVXZ basis is less size dependent than the cc-pVXZ and cc-pCVXZ sets in the prediction of the amino-group-related bond angles and dihedral angles and energy barriers for adenine, guanine, and cytosine. The cc-pCVQZ and aug-cc-pVQZ MP2 results may be regarded as benchmark predictions for the five common bases.

Electronic structure calculations reveal that the reaction has an entrance barrier of about 17 KJ mol-1.

Forward-convolution fitting of our experimental data together with electronic structure calculations (B3LYP/6-311+G**) indicate that the reaction is without entrance barrier and governed by an initial attack of the CN radical on the carbon side to the aromatic π electron density of the benzene molecule to form a Cs symmetric C6H6CN(C6D6CN) complex. At all collision energies, the center-of-mass angular distributions are forward-backward symmetric and peak at π/2. This shape documents that the decomposing intermediate has a lifetime longer than its rotational period. The H/D atom is emitted almost perpendicular to the C6H5CN plane, giving preferentially sideways scattering. This experimental finding can be rationalized in light of the electronic structure calculations depicting a H-C-C angle of 101.2° in the exit transition state. The latter is found to be tight and located about 32.8 kJ mol-1 above the products.

It is confirmed in this study that the four states of CH2 all have bent structures with longer CH bond lengths and smaller bond angles than the four lower-lying (X̃, ã, b̃, and c̃) states of CH2. At the CISD optimized geometries single point energies were determined with complete active space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) and CASSCF second-order configuration interaction (SOCI) levels of theory. For the triplet excited states single point energies were also determined employing coupled cluster with single and double excitations (CCSD) and CCSD with perturbative triple excitations methods. At the CISD level with the largest basis set, the triple zeta plus triple polarizations with two sets of higher angular momentum and two sets of diffuse functions basis set [TZ3P(2f,2d)+2diff], the bond angles were predicted to be 40.6° (3A2), 46.1° (1A2), 76.3° (3B2), and 81.3° (1B2). while the dipole moments were determined to be 2.35 (3A2), 2.26 (1A2), 1.69 (3A2), and 1.60 debye (1B2), respectively. With the most accurate method in this study, the CASSCF-SOCI level with the TZ3P(2f,2d)+2diff basis set, the energy separations (Te value) between the ground state (X̃ 3B1) and the four excited states were predicted to be 73.7 kcal/mol (3.20 eV, 25 800 cm-1) for the 3A2 state, 96.8 kcal/mol (4.20 eV, 33 800 cm-1!) for the 1A2 state, 151.0 kcal/mol (6.55 eV, 52 800 cm-1) for the 3B2 state, and 182.5 kcal/mol (7.91 eV, 63 800 cm-1) for the 1B2 state, respectively. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.",

Seven distinct structures were investigated with full geometry optimizations at the self-consistent field (SCF) level of theory. The effects of electron correlation were estimated with second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), modified coupled pair functional (MCPF) method, and the coupled cluster with sin-gle and double excitations (CCSD) method, and relativistic effects estimated using the Cowan-Griffin (mass-velocity and Darwin) corrections. Our results suggest that the ground state of the tungsten hexahydride (WH6) molecule is a closed-shell triangular prism belonging to the C3v point group, with a set of three hydrogens stacked on top of another set of three hydrogens. From the perspective of inorganic chemistry, it is truly remarkable that the octahedral structure lies 130 kcal/mol above the C3v ground state. Furthermore, these results imply major qualitative differences between WH6 and the well-known W(CH3)6 molecule. Another C3v structure, with one set of three hydrogens staggered with respect to the other set, is energetically nearby. With MCPF and relativistic corrections at the SCF optimized geometry, a third low-lying structure belonging to the C5v point group is virtually degenerate with the triangular prism C3v structure. © 1993 American Institute of Physics.",

Such displacements are often controlled by the competition between the potential energy along the minimum-energy reaction path and the energy requirements of one or more vibrational modes whose frequencies show a large variation along the reaction path. In calculating reaction rates from potential-energy functions we need to take account of these factors and - especially at lower temperatures - to include tunneling contributions, which also depend on the variation of vibrational frequencies along a reaction path. To include these effects requires more information about the activated complex region of the potential-energy surface than is required for conventional transition-state theory. In the present article we show how the vibrational and entropic effects of variational transition-state theory and the effective potentials and effective masses needed to calculate tunneling probabilities can be estimated with a minimum of electronic structure information, thereby allowing their computation at a higher level of theory than would otherwise be possible. As examples, we consider the reactions OH + H2, CH3 + H2, and Cl + CH 4 and some of their isotopic analogs. We find for Cl + CH4 → HCl + CH3 that the reaction rate is greatly enhanced by tunneling under conditions of interest for atmospheric chemistry. © 1991 American Institute of Physics.",

This involves the determination of the current density associated with, separately, the incoming and outgoing scattering wave functions in either an asymptotic (diabatic) or locally adiabatic basis. This yields a picture of how the incoming flux, initially associated with a given internal state, redistributes itself as a function of the interparticle separation both as the particles approach, and, subsequently, as the particles recede. It is shown that the separation into incoming and outgoing flux, which is valid asymptotically, continues to be valid as the collision partners approach, without mixing of the contributions from the incoming and outgoing waves. A simple extension of our linear-reference-potential, log-derivative propagation technique can be used to compute the redistribution of the initial flux. It is argued that analysis in a fully adiabatic basis, which corresponds to the local eigenvectors of the collision system, provides the most meaningful physical insight. A simple stabilization correction can be introduced, which prevents adiabatically closed channels from numerically contaminating the determination of flux redistribution among the locally open channels. Application is made to a pedagogical two-state problem, to a multistate collision system involving four different electronic potential curves, and to a second multistate collision system involving a closed-channel resonance. © 1991 American Institute of Physics.",

Confronting and solving problems involving complex physicochemical phenomena which intertwine complex heat, mass and radiative transfer processes with chemical kinetics is a challenge which physical and engineering scientists are becoming much more adept at meeting. Modern theoretical and experimental tools are now available which allow the design and utilization of much more comprehensive analytical models as well as their concomitant supporting and confirming experimental measurements.

Three monocyclic and two linear structures are considered. It is found that all the monocyclic structures are considerably lower in energy than the linear ones, in agreement with previous theoretical studies. At the highest level of theory, the lowest energy cyclic structure is predicted to lie 67 kcal/mole below the lowest energy linear structure. Correction for entropic contributions to the free energy at 3700 K reduces this ΔH value by about 40 kcal/mole. It is also concluded with confidence that the delocalized ring structure is more stable than the localized one with alternating single-triple bonds. Although the D5h symmetric monocyclic structure with cumulated double bonds is predicted to be the lowest state at the highest theoretical level (CISD with a DZP basis set) employed here, it is cautioned that the fully symmetric D10h monocyclic form might be more stable. Among the two linear structures, the triplet acetylenic form is almost isoenergetic with the triplet cumulenic one at CISD/DZP, and Davidson's correction places the former about 5 kcal/mole above the latter.

Three distinct levels of theory have been used: the self-consistent-field (SCF) method, configuration interaction (CI) including all single and double excitations, and full configuration interaction. Four different basis sets were used: double zeta (DZ), double zeta plus polarization (DZP), an extended basis set designated H (6s2p/4s2p), and a second extended basis set designated H (8s3p/6s3p). The higher levels of theory are in agreement that the only minimum for H5+ is a C 2υ structure, with three other stationary points (of D 2d, C2υ, and D2h symmetries) lying less than 1 kcal/ mol higher in energy. The predicted dissociation energy D 0 is 5.5 kcal/mol, which is estimated to be about 1 kcal/mol less than the exact D0. Furthermore, there are six other stationary points lying less than 8 kcal/mol above the minimum. Vibrational frequencies, dipole moments, and infrared intensities for each of the ten stationary points have been predicted at several different levels of theory. From the perspective of quantum chemistry, the H5+ system is very attractive as a candidate for the study of the vibrational dynamics of weakly bound systems. © 1987 American Institute of Physics.",

This limitation is becoming increasingly restrictive as commercially available machines are now within an order of magnitude of this asymptotic limit. A natural way to avoid this limit is to harness together many processors to work on a single computational problem. In principle, these parallel processing computers have speeds limited only by the number of processors one chooses to acquire. The usefulness of potentially unlimited processing speed to a computationally intensive field such as quantum chemistry is obvious. If these methods are to be applied to significantly larger chemical systems, parallel schemes will have to be employed. For this reason we have developed distributed-memory algorithms for a number of standard quantum chemical methods. We are currently implementing these on a 32 processor Intel hypercube. In this paper we present our algorithm and benchmark results for one of the bottleneck steps in quantum chemical calculations: the four index integral transformation. © 1987 American Institute of Physics.",

Double zeta (DZ) and double zeta plus polarization (DZ + P) basis sets have been used in this theoretical study, the latter designated O(9s5p1d/4s2p1d), H(4s1p/2s1p). These basis sets have been employed in conjunction with self-consistent field (SCF) and configuration interaction (CI) methods, including variationally up to 470 935 configurations.

A classical barrier height (i.e., with no zero point energy effects) of 6.3 kcal/mol is obtained, and application of the Davidson correction for unlinked clusters reduces this to 5.4 kcal/mol. Our best estimate is that the true classical barrier lies in the range 2-4 kcal/mol. The dynamics of the vinylidene/acetylene isomerization is described with the framework of the reaction path Hamiltonian. The lifetime of vinylidene (in its ground vibrational state) with respect to this process is calculated to be 0.24 to 4.6 ps for a classical barrier of 2 to 4 kcal/mol. This lifetime decreases by a factor of ∼2 if one quantum of the CH2 scissors mode of vinylidene is excited, but is predicted to increase somewhat if a quantum of the C-C stretch is excited. These results are all consistent with the recent experimental observation of vinylidene via photodetachment of C2H2 -. © 1984 American Institute of Physics.",

"De Castro S.C., Schaefer III H.F., Pitzer R.M.","Electronic structure of the N4+ molecular ion","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-36749113445&partnerID=40&md5=7aedef457771bc5b9635036f129f4269","The N4+ ion is an important species in the chemistry of the atmosphere. Here N4+ has been studied theoretically using the methods of ab initio molecular quantum mechanics. There is considerable complexity involved in the theoretical study of N4 + due to (a) the fact that N2+ has two low-lying electronic states, X 2∑g+ and A 2Πu and the order of these is reversed within the Hartree-Fock approximation and (b) there are six low-lying electronic states of N4+. Results are first presented at the self-consistent-field (SCF) level of theory using a double zeta (DZ) basis set N(9s 5p/As 2p). Both Koopmans'theorem and direct positive ion calculations in both D2h (rectangle) and C2v, (regular trapezoid) symmetry suggest only a single (out of six) substantially bound electronic state, the 2B2u (D2h) or 2A1(C 2v) state. Because the D2h SCF wave function necessitates a compromise description of the N2+N2+ asymptote, the predicted dissociation energy is artificially large, although in reasonable agreement with experiment. Polarization functions were added to the basis set and all three geometrical parameters examined to locate the C 2, equilibrium structure, which lies 19.9 kcal below the dissociation limit N2+N2+(2∑ R+). Similar theoretical methods were applied to the T-shape geometry, with the constrained equilibrium structure bound by 24.2 kcal. The linear conformation represents the absolute minimum on the N 4+ potential energy surface, lying 30.4 kcal below N2 + N2+. The latter dissociation energy agrees well with the experimental value of ∼26 kcal. In studying the linear 2∑ + state, the surprising result was found that the 2∑g+ restricted Hartree-Fock wave function is unstable with respect to the removal of the g/u element of symmetry. The 2Π state is stable in this respect, and as a result, the 2∑g+ state of N2+ falls closer to the 2Πu state in this mildly unrestricted form of Hartree-Fock theory. © 1981 American Institute of Physics.",

The first four cases encompass most open-shell systems of chemical interest, namely, the conventional restricted SCF wave functions for doublets, triplets, open-shell singlets, and quartets. The final case considered is the two-configuration SCF (TCSCF) wave function required to describe singlet diradicals and orbital symmetry forbidden reaction pathways. An explicit example of the latter procedure is provided by the least motion insertion of CH( 2Π) into H2(1Σg +) to yield the methyl radical. This doublet (S=1/2) TCSCF wave function is fairly typical of those required to theoretically explore problems in the physical chemistry of organic free radicals. Geometry optimization for the equilibrium structures of radical cations is illustrated by gradient calculations on H2CO+. © 1979 American Institute of Physics.",

As applied to engineering materials, people began to see relationships between them about 25 years ago, and even to perceive them as branches of a larger technology known variously as materials engineering or materials science. Over the last quarter-century, the interrelationships have changed and matured. Bridges have been built between the physics and chemistry of materials. But with this new understanding has come a change in viewpoint of materials engineering and science - a realization that, although much is known about materials, much more yet remains to be explained.
