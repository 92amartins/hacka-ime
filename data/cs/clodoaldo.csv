Clodoaldo Aparecido Moraes de Lima,Gesture phase segmentation using support vector machines,2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84961645015&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2016.02.021&partnerID=40&md5=0c2c263570350ccc8474635de81fa5c5,"Universidade de São Paulo - Escola de Artes, Ciências e Humanidades","An interaction between humans or between a human and a machine will be more effective if it is supported by gestures. In different levels of complexity, the communication system used in human interaction includes the use of gesture. In natural conversation, for instance, speakers use gestures for both to enhance the expressiveness of their speech and to support their own linguistic reasoning. The audience absorbs the content being transmitted also based on the speakers' gesticulation. Thus, an analysis of gestures should add value to the purpose of the interaction. One of the concerns in the analysis of gestures is the problem arising from the segmentation of phases of a gesture (rest position, preparation, stroke, hold and retraction), which, from the standpoint of Gesture Theory, may reveal information on prosody and semantics of what is being said in a discourse. Finding an automation solution to this problem involves enabling the development of theoretical and application areas that are based on the analysis of human behavior and on the interpretation and generation of natural language. In this study, the problem of gesture phase segmentation is modeled as a problem of classification, and then support vector machine is employed to design a model able to learn the patterns of gesture that are inherent to each phase. This work presents two main highlights. The first is to address the limitations of the segmentation approach through the study of its performance in different scenarios that represent the complexity of analyzing patterns of human behavior. In this study, we reached an F-score around 0.9 for rest position and around 0.8 for stroke and preparation as segmentation results in the best cases. Moreover, it was possible to investigate how classification models are influenced by human behavior. The second highlight refers to the conduction of an analysis by considering the standpoint of specialists concerned with gesture phase segmentation in the area of Linguistics and Psycholinguistics, through which we obtained impressive results. Thus, in regard to the suitability of our approach, it is a feasible means of supporting the development of the Gesture Theory as well as the Computational Linguistics and Human Machine Interaction fields. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we investigate the potentials of the conjoint use of relevance vector machines (RVM) and fractal dimension (FD) for automatically identifying EMG signals related to different classes of limb motion. The adoption of FD as the mechanism for feature extraction is justified by the fact that EMG signals usually show traces of self-similarity. In particular, four well-known FD estimation methods, namely box-counting, Higuchi’s, Katz’s and Sevcik’s methods, have been considered in this study. With respect to RVM, besides the standard formulation for binary classification, we also investigate the performance of two recently proposed variants, namely constructive mRVM and top-down mRVM, that deal specifically with multiclass problems. These classifiers operate solely over the features extracted by the FD estimation methods, and since the number of such features is relatively small, the efficiency of the classifier induction process is ensured. Results of experiments conducted on a publicly available dataset involving seven distinct types of limb motions are reported whereby we assess the performance of different configurations of the proposed RVM+FD approach. Overall, the results evidence that kernel machines equipped with the FD feature values can be useful for achieving good levels of classification performance. In particular, we have empirically observed that the features extracted by the Katz’s method is of better quality than the features generated by other methods. © 2015, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",EMG signal classification; Feature extraction; Fractal dimension; Relevance vector machines,Classification (of information); Electromyography; Extraction; Feature extraction; Finite difference method; Fractal dimension; Fractals; Automatic classification; Binary classification; Classification performance; Electromyography signals; Emg signal classifications; Neuromuscular disorders; Relevance Vector Machine; Surface electromyography signals; Biomedical signal processing

A face recognition system involves three important phases: face detection, feature extraction and classification (identification and/or verification). The robustness of face recognition could be improved by treating the variations in these stages. One of the main issues in design of face recognition system is how to extract discriminative facial features. A precise extraction of a representative feature set will improve the performance of a face recognition system. Various techniques have been used to represent images efficiently, of which the most well-known and widely applied are Wavelet, Contourlet, Shearlet and Curvelet Transform. Their ability to capture localized time-frequency information of image motivates their use for feature extraction. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study on these transforms as feature extractors from face images. To further reduce the feature dimensionality, we adopt Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis to select the most discriminative feature sets. The performance levels delivered by each transform are contrasted in terms of the accuracy measure computed over the outputs generated by the Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM). Experimental results conducted on a publicly available database are reported whereby we observe that the Curvelet Transform followed by the Wavelet Transform significantly outperform the others according to accuracy measure calculated over the SVM classifier. © 2015 IEEE.",Contourlet Transform; Curvelet Transform; Face Recognition; Shearlet Transform; Support Vector Machine; Wavelet Transform,Classification (of information); Discriminant analysis; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image retrieval; Principal component analysis; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Contourlet transform; Curvelet transforms; Face recognition systems; Feature extraction and classification; Linear discriminant analysis; Shearlet transforms; Support vector machine classifiers; Time frequency information; Face recognition

The detailed analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most influential steps for the proper diagnosis of this disorder. This work presents a systematic performance evaluation of the recently introduced optimum path forest (OPF) classifier when coping with the task of epilepsy diagnosis directly through EEG signal analysis. For this purpose, we have made extensive use of a benchmark dataset composed of five classes, whose full discrimination is very hard to achieve. Four types of wavelet functions and three well-known filter methods were considered for the tasks of feature extraction and selection, respectively. Moreover, support vector machines configured with radial basis function (SVM-RBF) kernel, multilayer perceptron neural networks (ANN-MLP), and Bayesian classifiers were used for comparison in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Overall, the results evidence the outperformance of the OPF classifier in both types of criteria. Indeed, the OPF classifier was usually extremely fast, with average training/testing times much lower than those required by SVM-RBF and ANN-MLP. Moreover, when configured with Coiflets as feature extractors, the performance scores achieved by the OPF classifier include 89.2% as average accuracy and sensitivity/specificity values higher than 80% for all five classes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian; EEG signal classification; Multilayer perceptrons; Optimum path forest; Support vector machines; Wavelets,Electric loads; Feature extraction; Forestry; Multilayer neural networks; Neural networks; Neurology; Radial basis function networks; Support vector machines; Bayesian; EEG signal classification; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Feature extraction and selection; Multi-layer perceptron neural networks; Optimum-path forests; Wavelets; Electroencephalography; article; artificial neural network; Bayesian learning; classifier; electroencephalogram; empirical research; epilepsy; learning algorithm; optimum path forest; perceptron; predictive value; priority journal; radial based function; support vector machine; wavelet analysis; Forestry; Neural Networks; Neurology

As a consequence, various pattern recognition approaches, consisting of different modules for feature extraction and classification of EMG signals, have been proposed. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study on the use of Fractal Dimension (FD) estimation methods as feature extractors from EMG signals. The usage of FD as feature extraction mechanism is justified by the fact that EMG signals usually show traces of self-similarity and by the ability of FD to characterize and measure the complexity inherent to different types of muscle contraction. In total, eight different methods for calculating the FD of an EMG waveform are considered here, and their performance as feature extractors is comparatively assessed taking into account nine well-known classifiers of different types and complexities. Results of experiments conducted on a dataset involving seven distinct types of limb motions are reported whereby we could observe that the normalized version of the Katzs estimation method and the Hurst exponent significantly outperform the others according to a class separability measure and five well-known accuracy measures calculated over the induced classifiers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These good results have motivated its application to several complex problems, including temporal information analysis. In this context, some studies attempt to extract temporal features from data and submit these features in a vector representation to traditional Support Vector Machines. However, Support Vector Machines and its traditional variations do not consider temporal dependency among data. Thus, some approaches adapt Support Vector Machines internal mechanism in order to integrate some processing of temporal characteristics, attempting to make them able to interpret the temporal information inherent on data.

Such architecture combines fuzzy-connectionist, heuristic and syntactical pattern recognition approaches, and deals with gesture recognition based on primitives. The modeling with primitives allows the use of multiples classifiers in order to achieve high classification accuracy. The heuristic classifier and the fuzzy syntactical integrating strategy are described in this paper. The fuzzy-connectionist classifiers were discussed in previous works and they are now revisited just to present the set of parameters that solves the current proof of concept, in the scope of Brazilian Sign Language Manual Alphabet. The fuzzy syntactical strategy coupled with the modeling with primitives has improved the pattern recognition results, enabling the design of architecture for classification with high flexibility and scalability to development of applications in different signed communication contexts.

Methods and materials: The kernel machines investigated include the standard support vector machine (SVM), the least squares SVM, the Lagrangian SVM, the smooth SVM, the proximal SVM, and the relevance vector machine. An extensive series of experiments was conducted on publicly available data, whose clinical EEG recordings were obtained from five normal subjects and five epileptic patients. The performance levels delivered by the different kernel machines are contrasted in terms of the criteria of predictive accuracy, sensitivity to the kernel function/parameter value, and sensitivity to the type of features extracted from the signal. For this purpose, 26 values for the kernel parameter (radius) of two well-known kernel functions (namely, Gaussian and exponential radial basis functions) were considered as well as 21 types of features extracted from the EEG signal, including statistical values derived from the discrete wavelet transform, Lyapunov exponents, and combinations thereof. Results: We first quantitatively assess the impact of the choice of the wavelet basis on the quality of the features extracted. Four wavelet basis functions were considered in this study. Then, we provide the average accuracy (i.e., cross-validation error) values delivered by 252 kernel machine configurations; in particular, 40%/35% of the best-calibrated models of the standard and least squares SVMs reached 100% accuracy rate for the two kernel functions considered. Moreover, we show the sensitivity profiles exhibited by a large sample of the configurations whereby one can visually inspect their levels of sensitiveness to the type of feature and to the kernel function/parameter value. Conclusions: Overall, the results evidence that all kernel machines are competitive in terms of accuracy, with the standard and least squares SVMs prevailing more consistently. Moreover, the choice of the kernel function and parameter value as well as the choice of the feature extractor are critical decisions to be taken, albeit the choice of the wavelet family seems not to be so relevant. Also, the statistical values calculated over the Lyapunov exponents were good sources of signal representation, but not as informative as their wavelet counterparts. Finally, a typical sensitivity profile has emerged among all types of machines, involving some regions of stability separated by zones of sharp variation, with some kernel parameter values clearly associated with better accuracy rates (zones of optimality). © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",EEG signal classification; Epilepsy; Feature extraction; Kernel machines,Accuracy rate; Comparative studies; Cross validation; EEG recording; EEG signal classification; EEG signals; Electroencephalogram signals; Epilepsy; Epileptic patients; Exponential radial basis; Feature extractor; Gaussians; Kernel function; Kernel machine; Kernel parameter; Kernel-based learning; Lagrangian; Least Square; Lyapunov exponent; Optimality; Parameter values; Performance level; Predictive accuracy; Relevance Vector Machine; Sensitivity profiles; Signal representations; Systematic assessment; Wavelet basis; Wavelet basis functions; Differential equations; Discrete wavelet transforms; Feature extraction; Least squares approximations; Lyapunov functions; Lyapunov methods; Radial basis function networks; Sensitivity analysis; Standards; Support vector machines; Electroencephalography; article; calibration; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; electroencephalogram; epilepsy; human; kernel method; priority journal; quantitative analysis; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; validation process; Artificial Intelligence; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Humans; Sensitivity and Specificity; Support Vector Machines

SVM are based on the Vapnik's Statistical Learning Theory, and successively extended by a number of researchers. On the order hand, the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal captures the electrical activity of the brain and is an important source of information for studying neurological disorders. In order to extract relevant information of EEG signal, a variety of computerized-analysis methods have been developed. Recent studies indicate that methods based on the nonlinear dynamics theory can extract valuable information from neuronal dynamics. However, many these of methods need large amount of data and are computationally expensive. From chaos theory, a global value that is relatively simple to compute is the fractal dimension (FD), it can be used to measure the geometrical complexity of a time series. The FD of a waveform represents a powerful tool for transient detection. In analysis of EEG this feature can been used to identify and distinguish specific states of physiologic function. A variety of algorithms are available for the computation of FD. In this work, we employ SVM to classify the EEG signals from healthy subjects and epileptic subjects using as the features vector the FD. From the experimental results, we can see that classification based on SVM with FD perform well in EEG signals classification, which indicates this classification method is valid and has promising application. © 2009 IEEE.",,Analysis method; Automatic recognition; Classification methods; EEG signals; EEG signals classification; Electrical activities; Electroencephalogram signals; Epileptic seizures; Features vector; Geometrical complexity; Healthy subjects; Machine learning techniques; Neurological disorders; Neuronal dynamics; Nonlinear dynamics theory; Physiologic function; Specific state; Statistical learning theory; Transient detection; Wave forms; Brain; Chaos theory; Finite difference method; Fractal dimension; Image retrieval; Learning algorithms; Multilayer neural networks; Support vector machines; Time series; Electroencephalography

Among the SVM variants, least-squares SVMs have gained increased attention recently due to the computational benefits they usually entail. Although considered as high-performance models, it is consensual that the applicability of these vector machines depends very much on a proper choice of some control parameters. In this paper, we present a sensitivity analysis study contrasting the performance profiles exhibited by standard and least-squares SVM classifiers with respect to the calibration of the kernel parameter value alone. The results achieved with simulations involving seven dataseis indicate that the performance profiles are usually qualitatively similar for the two types of vector machines, both presenting kernel parameter values clearly associated with a better performance, and that the choice of the kernel function seems to be more critical than that of its parameter value. © 2007 IEEE.",,Control parameters; International conferences; Kernel functions; Kernel parameters; Least squares (LS); Machine-learning; Multi-layer support vector machines (SVM) classifiers; Non-trivial; Parameter values; Performance modelling; Support vector machines ((SVM)); Systems design; Two types; Vector machines; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Computational fluid dynamics; Control system analysis; Control theory; Intelligent control; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Least squares approximations; Military data processing; Parameter estimation; Standards; Support vector machines; Systems analysis; Vectors; Sensitivity analysis

Due to the existence of high-dimensional input spaces in the context of time series prediction, mainly under the existence of long-term dependencies in the time series, we propose here a method based on the wrapper methodology to perform variable selection, so that only a subset of highly-informative lags is going to be considered as the regression vector.

This is done by deploying a separate gating module for softly dividing the input space into overlapping regions to be each assigned to one or more expert networks. Conversely, support vector machines (SVMs) refer to kernel-based methods, neural-network-alike models that constitute an approximate implementation of the structural risk minimization principle. Such learning machines follow the simple, but powerful idea of nonlinearly mapping input data into high-dimensional feature spaces wherein a linear decision surface discriminating different regions is properly designed. In this work, we formally characterize and empirically evaluate a novel approach, named as Mixture of Support Vector Machine Experts (MSVME), whose main purpose is to combine the complementary properties of both SVM and ME models. In the formal characterization, an algorithm based on a maximum likelihood criterion is considered for the MSVME training, and we demonstrate that it is possible to train each expert based on an SVM perspective. Regarding the empirical evaluation, simulation results involving nonlinear dynamic system identification problems are reported, contrasting the performance shown by the MSVME approach with that exhibited by conventional SVM and ME models. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It has been employed as a means to counteract some problems related to the design of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, namely, the estimation of a (usually large) number of free parameters, the proper definition of the model's dimension, and the choice of the sources of nonlinearities (activation functions). In this work, the potentials of PPL are exploited through a different perspective, namely, in designing one-hidden-layer feedforward ANNs for the adaptive control of nonlinear dynamic systems. For such purpose, the proposed methodology is divided into three stages. In the first, the model identification process is undertaken. In the second, the ANN structure is defined according to an offline control setting. In these two stages, the PPL algorithm estimates not only the optimal number of hidden neurons but also the best activation function for each node. The final stage is performed online and promotes a fine-tuning in the parameters of the identification model and the controller. Simulation results indicate that it is possible to design effective neural models based on PPL for the control of nonlinear multivariate systems, with superior performance when compared to benchmarks. ©2006 IEEE.",Artificial neural network; Control; Dynamic systems; Projection pursuit learning,Adaptive control systems; Adaptive systems; Backpropagation; Boolean functions; Computer simulation; Control systems; Dynamic programming; Dynamical systems; Education; Estimation; Food processing; Function evaluation; Intelligent control; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Modal analysis; Neural networks; Parameter estimation; Projection systems; Schrodinger equation; Stages; Activation function (AF); Adaptive Control; Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models; Constructive learning algorithm; Feed forward (FF); Free parameters; Hidden neurons; Identification models; International (CO); model identification; Neural modeling; Non-linear dynamic systems; non-linearities; Non-parametric regression; Nonlinear multivariate systems; offline control; Optimal number; Projection pursuit learning; simulation results; superior performance; Two stages; Identification (control systems)

This work addresses the application of SVC, a kernel-based method, in a context in which the channel equalization problem is conceived as a clustering task. The main challenge, in this case, is to perform unsupervised clustering aiming at the design of an optimal Bayesian or a blind prediction-based receiver without resorting to a priori information about the transmission medium. The proposed technique employs a two-stage procedure - a combination between the use of SVC to obtain a first set of clusters and an auxiliary heuristic to help separating eventual multiple clouds contained in a single cluster and attribute centers to them via an iterated local search (ILS) algorithm.

Neural network models have been adopted to perform both steps, by means of unsupervised and supervised learning, respectively. The flexibility and the generalization capability are the most relevant attributes in favor of connectionist approaches. However, even though time series prediction can be roughly interpreted as learning from data, high levels of performance will solely be achieved if some peculiarities of each time series are properly considered in the design, particularly the existence of trend and seasonality. Instead of directly adopting detrend and/or deseasonality treatments, this paper proposes a novel paradigm for supervised learning based on a mixture of heterogeneous experts. Some mixture models have already been proved to produce good performance as predictors, but the present approach will be devoted to a hybrid mixture composed of a set of distinct experts. The purpose is not only to further explore the ""divide-and-conquer"" principle, but also to compare the performance of mixture of heterogeneous experts with the standard mixture of experts approach, using ten distinct time series. The obtained results indicate that mixture of heterogeneous experts generally requires a more elaborate gating device and performs better in the case of more challenging time series. © 2005 IEEE.",,Data acquisition; Expert systems; Input output programs; Learning systems; Mapping; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Performance; Gating device; Input-output mapping; Mixture of heterogeneous experts; Prediction models; Time series analysis

The weight vectors, each one associated with one received signal, can be directly obtained if the direction of arrival (DOA) of the corresponding signal has already been estimated. The process of DOA estimation involves the prediction of the angle of arrival by means of monitoring the output produced by the antennas in the array, given that the number of antennas is higher than the number of signals to be detected. Even though signal subspace techniques have made a good job in DOA estimation, they present some important drawbacks that will be alleviated here using a supervised learning approach, in the form of a multiclass LS-SVM classification problem. The main contribution of this paper is twofold: a step-by-step description of the complete set of algebraic manipulation for data preprocessing and for the synthesis of the classification device, and an analysis of the effect in performance when relevant parameters vary in a given operational interval. © 2005 IEEE.",Antenna arrays; Direction of arrival estimation; LS-SVM; Multi-class classification; Parameter sensitivity,Classification (of information); Directional patterns (antenna); Learning systems; Sensitivity analysis; Signal receivers; Algebraic manipulation; Direction of arrival (DOA); Signal subspace techniques; Support vector machines; Antenna arrays
