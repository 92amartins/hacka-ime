To further investigate effects of this kind, this article reports two eye-tracking experiments that measure the time required to recognize target objects based on different kinds of information. Results suggest that referential overspecification may be either helpful or detrimental to identification depending on the kind of information that is actually overspecified, an insight that may be useful for the design of more informed hearer-oriented REG algorithms. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,

This work presents a shallow surface realisation system that makes use of factored language models (FLMs) of Portuguese to overcome some of these difficulties. The system combines FLMs trained on a large corpus with a number of NLP resources that have been made publicly available by the Brazilian NLP research community in recent years, such as corpora, dictionaries, thesauri and others.

In this work we discuss a supervised machine learning approach to the problem, focusing on instances of anaphora ubiquitously found in a corpus of Brazilian Portuguese texts, namely, third-person pronominal references. Although still limited to a subset of the more general co-reference resolution problem, our present results are comparable to existing work in the field in both English and Portuguese languages, representing the highest accuracy rates that we are aware of in (Brazilian) Portuguese pronoun resolution. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,Accuracy rate; Anaphora resolution; Essential component; Machine translations; Machine-learning; Portuguese languages; Pronoun resolution; Reference resolution; Supervised machine learning; Computer aided language translation; Information theory; Robot learning; Speech transmission; Artificial intelligence

Preliminary results show significant improvement in resolution precision and recall, and are comparable to existing rule-based approaches for the Portuguese language spoken in Brazil.",Anaphora resolution; Machine learning,Anaphora resolution; Learning approach; Part-of-speech tagger; Portuguese languages; Precision and recall; Pronoun resolution; Rule-based approach; Semantic analysis; Computational grammars; Learning systems; Semantics; Cost benefit analysis

Algorithms of this kind are required to produce descriptions that are brief (or even minimal) and, at the same time, as close as possible to the choices made by human speakers. In this work we attempt to achieve a balance between brevity and humanlikeness by implementing a number of algorithms for the task. The algorithms are tested against descriptions produced by humans in two different domains, suggesting a strategy that is both computationally simple and comparable to the state of the art in the field. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,Attribute selection; Definite descriptions; Different domains; Natural language generation; Semantic content; State of the art; Artificial intelligence

Designing knowledge bases of this kind, typically represented as sets of grammar rules, may however become a costly, labour-intensive enterprise. In this work we take a statistical approach to surface realisation in which no linguistic knowledge is hard-coded, but rather trained automatically from large corpora. Results of a small experiment in the generation of referring expressions show significant levels of similarity between our (computer-generated) text and those produced by humans, besides the usual benefits commonly associated with statistical NLP such as low development costs, domain- and language-independency. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Costs; Information retrieval systems; Information theory; Knowledge representation; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Statistical methods; Development costs; Generation process; Grammar rules; International conferences; Knowledge bases; Labour-intensive; Linguistic knowledge; Natural language generation systems; NAtural language processing; Semantic representations; Statistical approaches; Target languages; Finance

In this work we describe the task of pronominal co-reference annotation and resolution in Portuguese texts, in which we take advantage of information provided by a tagged corpus and a simple annotation tool that has been developed for this purpose. Besides developing some of these basic resources from scratch, our ultimate goal is to investigate the multilingual resolution of Portuguese personal pronouns to improve the accuracy of their translations to both Spanish and English in an underlying MT project. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Computational linguistics; Laws and legislation; Query languages; Software agents; Text processing; Word processing; Intelligent text processing; International conferences; Pronoun resolution; Spanish; Spoken languages; Linguistics
Ivandré Paraboni,Generating referring expressions: Making referents easy to identify,2007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34347334453&partnerID=40&md5=d48c519e7a0705985b7f8629d5904cd5,"Universidade de São Paulo - Escola de Artes, Ciências e Humanidades","It is often desirable that referring expressions be chosen in such a way that their referents are easy to identify. This article focuses on referring expressions in hierarchically structured domains, exploring the hypothesis that referring expressions can be improved by including logically redundant information in them if this leads to a significant reduction in the amount of search that is needed to identify the referent. Generation algorithms are presented that implement this idea by including logically redundant information into the generated expression, in certain well-circumscribed situations. To test our hypotheses, and to assess the performance of our algorithms, two controlled experiments with human subjects were conducted. The first experiment confirms that human judges have a preference for logically redundant expressions in the cases where our model predicts this to be the case. The second experiment suggests that readers benefit from the kind of logical redundancy that our algorithms produce, as measured in terms of the effort needed to identify the referent of the expression. © 2007 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,

The present work focuses on the generation of Document Deixis in the context of a particular kind of natural language generation system in which these descriptions are not specified as part of the input, i.e., when it is up to the system to decide whether a reference is called for and, if so, which document entity it should refer to. We ask under what circumstances it is advantageous to describe domain objects in terms of the document parts where they are mentioned (as in ""the insulin described in section 2""). We report on an experiment suggesting that such indirect descriptions are preferred by human readers whenever they cause the generated descriptions to be shorter than they would otherwise be. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,Data reduction; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Document entity; Domain objects; Natural language generation system; Information retrieval systems
