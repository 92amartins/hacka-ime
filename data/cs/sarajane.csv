Sarajane Marques Peres,Grammatical facial expression recognition in sign language discourse: a study at the syntax level,2017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019691334&doi=10.1007%2fs10796-017-9765-z&partnerID=40&md5=56657af8847f29056c39692912b60049,"Universidade de São Paulo - Escola de Artes, Ciências e Humanidades","Facial Expression Recognition is an already well-developed research area, mainly due to its applicability in the construction of different system types. Facial expressions are especially important in the area which relates to the construction of discourses through sign language. Sign languages are visual-spatial languages that are not assisted by voice intonation. Therefore, they use facial expressions to support the manifestation of prosody aspects and some grammatical constructions. Such expressions are called Grammatical Facial Expressions (GFEs) and they are present at sign language morphological and syntactic levels. GFEs stand out in automated recognition processes for sign languages, as they help removing ambiguity among signals, and they also contribute to compose the semantic meaning of discourse. This paper aims to present a study which applies inductive reasoning to recognize patterns, as a way to study the problem involving the automated recognition of GFEs at the discourse syntactic level in the Libras Sign Language (Brazilian Sign Language). In this study, sensor Microsoft Kinect was used to capture three-dimensional points in the faces of subjects who were fluent in sign language, generating a corpus of Libras phrases, which comprised different syntactic constructions. This corpus was analyzed through classifiers that were implemented through neural network Multilayer Perceptron, and then a series of experiments was conducted. The experiments allowed investigating: the recognition complexity that is inherent to each of the GFEs that are present in the corpus; the use suitability of different vector representations, considering descriptive characteristics that are based on coordinates of points in three dimensions, distances and angles therefrom; the need for using time data regarding the execution of expressions during speech; and particularities that are connected to data labeling and the evaluation of classifying models in the context of a sign language. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York",Grammatical facial expression; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Sign language,Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Semantics; Speech recognition; Syntactics; Visual languages; Automated recognition; Facial expression recognition; Facial Expressions; Grammatical construction; Inductive reasoning; Microsoft kinect; Sign language; Vector representations; Face recognition
Sarajane Marques Peres,Gesture phase segmentation using support vector machines,2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84961645015&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2016.02.021&partnerID=40&md5=0c2c263570350ccc8474635de81fa5c5,"Universidade de São Paulo - Escola de Artes, Ciências e Humanidades","An interaction between humans or between a human and a machine will be more effective if it is supported by gestures. In different levels of complexity, the communication system used in human interaction includes the use of gesture. In natural conversation, for instance, speakers use gestures for both to enhance the expressiveness of their speech and to support their own linguistic reasoning. The audience absorbs the content being transmitted also based on the speakers' gesticulation. Thus, an analysis of gestures should add value to the purpose of the interaction. One of the concerns in the analysis of gestures is the problem arising from the segmentation of phases of a gesture (rest position, preparation, stroke, hold and retraction), which, from the standpoint of Gesture Theory, may reveal information on prosody and semantics of what is being said in a discourse. Finding an automation solution to this problem involves enabling the development of theoretical and application areas that are based on the analysis of human behavior and on the interpretation and generation of natural language. In this study, the problem of gesture phase segmentation is modeled as a problem of classification, and then support vector machine is employed to design a model able to learn the patterns of gesture that are inherent to each phase. This work presents two main highlights. The first is to address the limitations of the segmentation approach through the study of its performance in different scenarios that represent the complexity of analyzing patterns of human behavior. In this study, we reached an F-score around 0.9 for rest position and around 0.8 for stroke and preparation as segmentation results in the best cases. Moreover, it was possible to investigate how classification models are influenced by human behavior. The second highlight refers to the conduction of an analysis by considering the standpoint of specialists concerned with gesture phase segmentation in the area of Linguistics and Psycholinguistics, through which we obtained impressive results. Thus, in regard to the suitability of our approach, it is a feasible means of supporting the development of the Gesture Theory as well as the Computational Linguistics and Human Machine Interaction fields. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Sarajane Marques Peres,Classification of electromyography signals using relevance vector machines and fractal dimension,2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84932136825&doi=10.1007%2fs00521-015-1953-5&partnerID=40&md5=970740eb556af41eb82dfc025cfc2737,"Universidade de São Paulo - Escola de Artes, Ciências e Humanidades","Surface electromyography (EMG) signals have been studied extensively in the last years aiming at the automatic classification of hand gestures and movements as well as the early identification of latent neuromuscular disorders. In this paper, we investigate the potentials of the conjoint use of relevance vector machines (RVM) and fractal dimension (FD) for automatically identifying EMG signals related to different classes of limb motion. The adoption of FD as the mechanism for feature extraction is justified by the fact that EMG signals usually show traces of self-similarity. In particular, four well-known FD estimation methods, namely box-counting, Higuchi’s, Katz’s and Sevcik’s methods, have been considered in this study. With respect to RVM, besides the standard formulation for binary classification, we also investigate the performance of two recently proposed variants, namely constructive mRVM and top-down mRVM, that deal specifically with multiclass problems. These classifiers operate solely over the features extracted by the FD estimation methods, and since the number of such features is relatively small, the efficiency of the classifier induction process is ensured. Results of experiments conducted on a publicly available dataset involving seven distinct types of limb motions are reported whereby we assess the performance of different configurations of the proposed RVM+FD approach. Overall, the results evidence that kernel machines equipped with the FD feature values can be useful for achieving good levels of classification performance. In particular, we have empirically observed that the features extracted by the Katz’s method is of better quality than the features generated by other methods. © 2015, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",EMG signal classification; Feature extraction; Fractal dimension; Relevance vector machines,Classification (of information); Electromyography; Extraction; Feature extraction; Finite difference method; Fractal dimension; Fractals; Automatic classification; Binary classification; Classification performance; Electromyography signals; Emg signal classifications; Neuromuscular disorders; Relevance Vector Machine; Surface electromyography signals; Biomedical signal processing

In this context, could be profitable knowing the best combination of price, quality and services, considering the cost of transport between stores. Such a problem assumes a high complexity when more products and stores were involved, and it is a classical problem in supply chain network design - one of the most important issues in modern business management. The worldwide industry has been demanded innovative solutions from its information technology staff, and this is why it is worth-while exploring new directions for finding efficient solutions. In this paper, we analyse the use of metaheuristics algorithms combined to a new genetic operator, to optimize purchases of products in stores geographically separated, searching for a purchase with the lowest possible total cost with a minimum route.

Sarajane Marques Peres,Face recognition using Support Vector Machine and multiscale directional image representation methods: A comparative study,2015,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84950970469&doi=10.1109%2fIJCNN.2015.7280699&partnerID=40&md5=26bb9504983abe20a01eac79083f6c04,"Universidade de São Paulo - Escola de Artes, Ciências e Humanidades","In recent years, human identification based on face recognition has attracted the attention of the scientific community and the general public due to its wide range of applications. A face recognition system involves three important phases: face detection, feature extraction and classification (identification and/or verification). The robustness of face recognition could be improved by treating the variations in these stages. One of the main issues in design of face recognition system is how to extract discriminative facial features. A precise extraction of a representative feature set will improve the performance of a face recognition system. Various techniques have been used to represent images efficiently, of which the most well-known and widely applied are Wavelet, Contourlet, Shearlet and Curvelet Transform. Their ability to capture localized time-frequency information of image motivates their use for feature extraction. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study on these transforms as feature extractors from face images. To further reduce the feature dimensionality, we adopt Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis to select the most discriminative feature sets. The performance levels delivered by each transform are contrasted in terms of the accuracy measure computed over the outputs generated by the Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM). Experimental results conducted on a publicly available database are reported whereby we observe that the Curvelet Transform followed by the Wavelet Transform significantly outperform the others according to accuracy measure calculated over the SVM classifier. © 2015 IEEE.",Contourlet Transform; Curvelet Transform; Face Recognition; Shearlet Transform; Support Vector Machine; Wavelet Transform,Classification (of information); Discriminant analysis; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image retrieval; Principal component analysis; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Contourlet transform; Curvelet transforms; Face recognition systems; Feature extraction and classification; Linear discriminant analysis; Shearlet transforms; Support vector machine classifiers; Time frequency information; Face recognition

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs) in data mining tasks in the process mining context. The goal was to understand how these computational intelligence techniques are currently being applied in process mining. Design/methodology/approach – The authors conducted a systematic literature review with three research questions formulated to evaluate the use of ANNs and SVMs in process mining. Findings – The authors identified 11 papers as primary studies according to the criteria established in the review protocol. Most of them deal with process mining enhancement, mainly using ANNs. Regarding the data mining task, the authors identified three types of tasks used: categorical prediction (or classification); numeric prediction, considering the “regression” type, and clustering analysis. Originality/value – Although there is scientific interest in process mining, little attention has been specifically given to ANNs and SVM. This scenario does not reflect the general context of data mining, where these two techniques are widely used. This low use may be possibly due to a relative lack of knowledge about their potential for this type of problem, which the authors seek to reverse with the completion of this study. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Artificial neural networks; Computational intelligence; Data mining; Process mining; Support-vector machines,

This approach considers the dataset under analysis and proposes the dimension that best satisfies the dilemma: to maximize the reduction of dimension and to minimize the topographic distortions - measured with the Topographic Product. In order to reach this objective, we create the ""significant fractal fuzzy dimension measure"" as a variation of a fractal dimension measure.",,Algorithms; Decision making; Decision theory; Fractals; Fuzzy sets; Learning systems; Fractal dimension theory; Fuzzy approximated reasoning; Topographic mapping; Self organizing maps
