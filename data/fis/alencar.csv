Using optical absorption and transmission electron microscopy we studied the effect of the gradual addition of Al2O3 to the chemical composition of the soda aluminosilicate glasses. A quantitative method for the evaluation of the relative nanoparticles concentration, proportional to the optical absorption intensity of the silver Surface Plasmon Resonance band, was developed and applied to the study of the behavior of the number of particles precipitated in samples thermally treated at temperatures of 400, 500, and 600 °C. Three mechanisms were found, as consequence of the substitution of SiO4 by AlO4 glass forming local tetrahedral structural units, resulting in the gradual suppression of the negatively charged NBOs−, which are the only reducing sources available in the present non-irradiated glass system. The effects produced by the glass chemical and structural changes on the Ag nanoparticles production are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Optical absorption; Silver nanoparticles; Soda-lime silicate glasses; Surface plasmon resonance; Thermal treatment; Transmission electron microscopy,Aluminum; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Electron microscopy; Glass; Heat treatment; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Light absorption; Light transmission; Lime; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Plasmons; Silicates; Surface plasmon resonance; Transmission electron microscopy; Absorption intensity; Aluminosilicate glass; Chemical compositions; Formation and evolutions; Quantitative method; Silver nanoparticles; Soda lime silicate glass; Tetrahedral structural units; Silver

This study used human bronchial epithelium cells (BEAS-2B) in culture and evaluates their exposure to DEPs (15ug/mL for 1 and 2 h) in order to determine changes to cell rheology (viscoelasticity) and gene expression of the enzymes involved in oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cytotoxicity. BEAS-2B cells exposed to DEPs were found to have a significant loss in stiffness, membrane stability, and mitochondrial activity. The genes involved in apoptosis [B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2 and caspase-3)] presented inversely proportional expressions (p = 0.05, p = 0.01, respectively), low expression of the genes involved in antioxidant responses [SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1); SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2), and GPx (glutathione peroxidase) (p = 0.01)], along with an increase in cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) (p = 0.01). These results suggest that alterations in cell rheology and cytotoxicity could be associated with oxidative stress and imbalance between pro- and anti-apoptotic genes. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Air pollution; Cell rheology; Cytotoxicity; Gene expression; Oxidative stress; Ultrafine particles,"antioxidant; BCL2 protein, human; caspase 3; CYP1A1 protein, human; cytochrome P450 1A1; exhaust gas; glutathione peroxidase; particulate matter; protein bcl 2; apoptosis; bronchus; cell line; cell survival; drug effects; epithelium cell; exhaust gas; flow kinetics; gene expression; genetics; human; metabolism; oxidative stress; particle size; particulate matter; pathology; toxicity; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Bronchi; Caspase 3; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Epithelial Cells; Gene Expression; Glutathione Peroxidase; Humans; Oxidative Stress; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Rheology; Vehicle Emissions"
Adriano M. Alencar,Validation of capillarity theory at the nanometer scale by atomistic computer simulations of water droplets and bridges in contact with hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces,2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84956680895&doi=10.1021%2facs.jpcc.5b10377&partnerID=40&md5=a2d76ee29f879d295c9088171fdd5015,Universidade de São Paulo - Instituto de Física,"Capillarity is the study of interfaces between two immiscible liquids or between a liquid and a vapor. The theory of capillarity was created in the early 1800s, and it is applicable to mesoscopic and macroscopic (&gt;1 μm) systems. In general, macroscopic theories are expected to fail at the &lt;10 nm scales where molecular details may become relevant. In this work, we show that, surprisingly, capillarity theory (CT) provides satisfactory predictions at 2-10 nm scales. Specifically, we perform atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of water droplets and capillary bridges of different symmetry in contact with various surfaces. The underlying structure of the surfaces corresponds to hydroxilated (crystalline) silica which is modified to cover a wide range of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. In agreement with CT, it is found that water contact angle is independent of the droplet/bridge geometry and depends only on the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the surface employed. In addition, CT provides the correct droplet/bridge profile for all (hydrophobic/hydrophilic) surfaces considered. Remarkably, CT works even for the very small droplets/bridges studied, for which the smallest dimension is 2 nm. It follows that the concepts of surface tension and contact angle are indeed meaningful at 2-10 nm scales even when, macroscopically, such concepts are not justified. In order to confirm the self-consistency of CT at 2-10 nm scales, we also calculate the capillary forces between different surfaces induced by water capillary bridges. These forces depend on the liquid-vapor surface tension of water, . Using CT, the calculated forces indicate that = 0.054 ± 0.001 N/m2. This is in agreement with the value = 0.056 ± 0.001 N/m2 obtained independently using the Kirkwood-Buff method, and it is consistent with values of reported in the literature for the present water model. Confirming the validity of CT at 2-10 nm scales has relevant implications in scientific applications, such as in our understanding of self-assembly processes at interfaces. We discuss briefly this and other consequences of the present results. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,Capillarity; Contact angle; Drop formation; Drops; Hydrophobicity; Liquids; Molecular dynamics; Self assembly; Surface tension; Atomistic computer simulation; Atomistic molecular dynamics; Hydrophobic and hydrophilic; Hydrophobic/hydrophilic; Liquid-vapor surfaces; Satisfactory predictions; Scientific applications; Self assembly process; Phase interfaces

The CSK is in a constant state of remodeling, moreover, which is an active non-equilibrium thermodynamic process. We report here that cytoskeletal remodeling involves reconfigurations that are not only sudden but also are transmitted to great distances within the cell in a fashion reminiscent of quakes in the Earth's crust. Remarkably, these events in the cell conform both qualitatively and quantitatively to empirical laws typical of earthquakes, including hierarchical fault structures, cumulative energy distributions following the Gutenberg-Richter law, and rate of after-shocks following Omori's law. While it is well-established that remodeling and stabilization of the cytoskeleton are non-equilibrium process, these new unanticipated observations establish that these processes are also remarkably non-local and strongly cooperative. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,Earthquakes; Structural geology; Cumulative energy; Earth's crust; Empirical laws; Fault structure; Gutenberg-Richter law; Non equilibrium; Non equilibrium thermodynamics; Non-equilibrium process; Stabilization
Adriano M. Alencar,Smoking and female sex: Independent predictors of human vascular smooth muscle cells stiffening,2015,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957112195&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0145062&partnerID=40&md5=effc1665b7082e49b479cc042f605296,Universidade de São Paulo - Instituto de Física,"Aims Recent evidence shows the rigidity of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) contributes to vascular mechanics. Arterial rigidity is an independent cardiovascular risk factor whose associated modifications in VSMC viscoelasticity have never been investigated. This study's objective was to evaluate if the arterial rigidity risk factors aging, African ancestry, female sex, smoking and diabetes mellitus are associated with VMSC stiffening in an experimental model using a human derived vascular smooth muscle primary cell line repository. Methods Eighty patients subjected to coronary artery bypass surgery were enrolled. VSMCs were extracted from internal thoracic artery fragments and mechanically evaluated using Optical Magnetic Twisting Cytometry assay. The obtained mechanical variables were correlated with the clinical variables: age, gender, African ancestry, smoking and diabetes mellitus. Results The mechanical variables Gr, G'r and G""r had a normal distribution, demonstrating an interindividual variability of VSMC viscoelasticity, which has never been reported before. Female sex and smoking were independently associated with VSMC stiffening: Gr (apparent cell stiffness) p = 0.022 and p = 0.018, R2 0.164; G'r (elastic modulus) p = 0.019 and p = 0.009, R2 0.184 and G''r (dissipative modulus) p = 0.011 and p = 0.66, R2 0.141. Conclusion Female sex and smoking are independent predictors of VSMC stiffening. This pro-rigidity effect represents an important element for understanding the vascular rigidity observed in post-menopausal females and smokers, as well as a potential therapeutic target to be explored in the future. There is a significant inter-individual variation of VSMC viscoelasticity, which is slightly modulated by clinical variables and probably relies on molecular factors. © 2015 Dinardo et al.

This study was conducted to evaluate the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and to analyze the mucin profile (acid (AB+), neutral (PAS+), or mixed (AB/PAS+) mucus) and vacuolization (V) of tracheal explants after treatment with 50 or 100 μg/mL DEP for 30 or 60 min. Western blot analyses showed small increases in ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation after 30 min of 100 μg/mL DEP treatment compared with the control. An increase in JNK phosphorylation was observed after 60 min of treatment with 50 μg/mL DEP compared with the control. We did not observe any change in the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation after treatment with 50 μg/mL DEP. Other groups of tracheas were subjected to histological sectioning and stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reagent and Alcian Blue (AB). The stained tissue sections were then subjected to morphometric analysis. The results obtained were compared using ANOVA. Treatment with 50 μg/mL DEP for 30 min or 60 min showed a significant increase (p&lt;0.001) in the amount of acid mucus, a reduction in neutral mucus, a significant reduction in mixed mucus, and greater vacuolization. Our results suggest that compounds found in DEPs are able to activate acid mucus production and enhance vacuolization and cell signaling pathways, which can lead to airway diseases. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Biomarkers; DEP; Explants; Histopathology; MAPK; Signal transduction,"Biomarkers; Body fluids; Cell death; Enzyme activity; Enzymes; Phosphorylation; Signal transduction; Signaling; C-jun N-terminal kinase; DEP; Diesel exhaust particulates; Explants; Extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Histopathology; Intracellular signaling pathways; MAPK; Cell signaling; diesel fuel; mitogen activated protein kinase; mucin; stress activated protein kinase; air pollutant; exhaust gas; mitogen activated protein kinase; mucin; particulate matter; stress activated protein kinase; animal experiment; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; Bagg albino mouse; cell vacuole; chemical composition; controlled study; exhaust gas; explant; exposure; intracellular signaling; male; mouse; nonhuman; organ culture; particulate matter; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; scanning electron microscopy; tissue section; toxicity; trachea; Western blotting; air pollutant; animal; apoptosis; dose response; drug effects; epithelium cell; exhaust gas; metabolism; mucus; particulate matter; pathology; phosphorylation; signal transduction; toxicity; trachea; Mus; Air Pollutants; Animals; Apoptosis; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Epithelial Cells; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mucins; Mucus; Particulate Matter; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; Trachea; Vehicle Emissions"
Adriano M. Alencar,Numeric reconstruction of 2D cellular actomyosin network from substrate displacement,2015,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84955282919&doi=10.1590%2f2446-4740.0778&partnerID=40&md5=e253cbe73941a9aba7384226673f20fc,Universidade de São Paulo - Instituto de Física,"Introduction: One of the fundamental structural elements of the cell is the cytoskeleton. Along with myosin, actin microfilaments are responsible for cellular contractions, and their organization may be related to pathological changes in myocardial tissue. Due to the complexity of factors involved, numerical modeling of the cytoskeleton has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of mechanical cues in cellular activities. In this work, a systematic method was developed for the reconstruction of an actomyosin topology based on the displacement exerted by the cell on a flexible substrate. It is an inverse problem which could be considered a phenomenological approach to traction force microscopy (TFM). Methods: An actomyosin distribution was found with a topology optimization method (TOM), varying the material density and angle of contraction of each element of the actomyosin domain. The routine was implemented with a linear material model for the bidimensional actomyosin elements and tridimensional substrate. The topology generated minimizes the nodal displacement squared differences between the generated topology and experimental displacement fields obtained by TFM. The structure resulting from TOM was compared to the actin structures observed experimentally with a GFP-attached actin marker. Results: The optimized topology reproduced the main features of the experimental actin and its squared displacement differences were 11.24 µm2, 27.5% of the sum of experimental squared nodal displacements (40.87 µm2). Conclusion: This approach extends the literature with a model for the actomyosin structure capable of distributing anisotropic material freely, allowing heterogeneous contraction over the cell extension. © 2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica.

A probe, precisely positioned close to the cell, was capable of a vertical localized mechanical stimulation with a temporal frequency of 207 Hz, and strain magnitude of 50%. This setup was characterized and used to probe the response of Human Umbilical Endothelial Vein Cells (HUVECs) in terms of calcium signaling. The intracellular calcium ion concentration was measured by the genetically encoded Cameleon biosensor, with the Transient Receptor Potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 7 (TRPM7) expression inhibited. As TRPM7 expression also regulates adhesion, a relatively simple method for measuring adhesion of cells was also developed, tested and used to study the effect of adhesion alone. Three adhesion conditions of HUVECs on polyacrylamide gel dishes were compared. In the first condition, the substrate is fully treated with Sulfo-SANPAH crosslinking and fibronectin. The other two conditions had increasingly reduced adhesion: partially treated (only coated with fibronectin, with no use of Sulfo-SANPAH, at 5% of the normal amount) and non-treated polyacrylamide gels. The cells showed adhesion and calcium response to the mechanical stimulation correlated to the degree of gel treatment: highest for fully treated gels and lowest for non-treated ones. TRPM7 inhibition by siRNA on HUVECs caused an increase in adhesion relative to control (no siRNA treatment) and non-targeting siRNA, but a decrease to 80% of calcium response relative to non-targeting siRNA which confirms the important role of TRPM7 in mechanotransduction despite the increase in adhesion. © 2015 Nishitani et al.",,"calcium ion; fibronectin; polyacrylamide gel; small interfering RNA; transient receptor potential channel M7; calcium; protein serine threonine kinase; transient receptor potential channel M; TRPM7 protein, human; Article; biosensor; calcium cell level; calcium signaling; cell adhesion; cell adhesion assay; controlled study; human; human cell; mechanical stimulation; mechanotransduction; protein expression; umbilical vein endothelial cell; calcium signaling; cell adhesion; cell culture; genetic procedures; genetics; mechanics; metabolism; physiology; RNA interference; Biosensing Techniques; Calcium; Calcium Signaling; Cell Adhesion; Cells, Cultured; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Mechanical Phenomena; Mechanotransduction, Cellular; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; TRPM Cation Channels"

Crude DEP and DEP after extraction with hexane (DEP/HEX) were utilized. The partial reduction of some DEP/HEX organics increased the biodisponibility of many metallic elements. JNK and ERK were activated simultaneously by crude DEP with no alterations in viscoelasticity of the cells. Mitochondrial activity, however, revealed a decrease through the MTT assay. DEP/HEX treatment increased viscoelasticity and cytotoxicity (membrane damage), and also activated JNK. Our data suggest that the greater bioavailability of metals could be involved in JNK activation and, consequently, in the reduction of fiber coherence and increase in the viscoelasticity and cytotoxicity of BEAS cells. The adverse findings detected after exposure to crude DEP and to DEP/HEX reflect the toxic potential of diesel compounds. Considering the fact that the cells of the respiratory epithelium are the first line of defense between the body and the environment, our data contribute to a better understanding of the pathways leading to respiratory cell injury and provide evidence for the onset of or worsening of respiratory diseases caused by inorganic compounds present in DEP. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.",Cell viscoelasticity; Cytotoxicity; Diesel exhaust particles; MAPKs; Metals,"inorganic compound; Janus kinase; lactate dehydrogenase; mitogen activated protein kinase; exhaust gas; inorganic compound; mitogen activated protein kinase; particulate matter; Article; cell disruption; cell size; cell viability; colorimetry; controlled study; cytoskeleton; cytotoxicity; enzyme activation; enzyme phosphorylation; exhaust gas; human; human cell; particle size; protein expression; viscoelasticity; bronchus; cell culture; cytoskeleton; drug effects; enzyme activation; epithelium cell; exhaust gas; metabolism; particulate matter; respiratory tract mucosa; toxicity; Bronchi; Cells, Cultured; Cytoskeleton; Enzyme Activation; Epithelial Cells; Humans; Inorganic Chemicals; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Particulate Matter; Respiratory Mucosa; Vehicle Emissions"

However, snoring is not objectively measured during polysomnography, and no standard treatment is available for primary snoring or when snoring is associated with mild forms of OSA. This study determined the effects of oropharyngeal exercises on snoring in minimally symptomatic patients with a primary complaint of snoring and diagnosis of primary snoring or mild to moderate OSA. METHODS: Patients were randomized for 3 months of treatment with nasal dilator strips plus respiratory exercises (control) or daily oropharyngeal exercises (therapy). Patients were evaluated at study entry and end by sleep questionnaires (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and full polysomnography with objective measurements of snoring. RESULTS: We studied 39 patients (age, 46 ± 13 years; BMI, 28.2 ± 3.1 kg/m2; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), 15.3 ± 9.3 events/h; Epworth Sleepiness Scale, 9.2 ± 4.9; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 6.4 ± 3.3). Control (n = 20) and therapy (n = 19) groups were similar at study entry. One patient from each group dropped out. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. No significant changes occurred in the control group. In contrast, patients randomized to therapy experienced a significant decrease in the snore index (snores > 36 dB/h), 99.5 (49.6-221.3) vs 48.2 (25.5-219.2); P = .017 and total snore index (total power of snore/h), 60.4 (21.8-220.6) vs 31.0 (10.1-146.5); P = .033. CONCLUSIONS: Oropharyngeal exercises are effective in reducing objectively measured snoring and are a possible treatment of a large population suffering from snoring.

However, VSMCs are known to be molecularly heterogeneous in other aspects and their mechanics may play a role in pathological situations. Our aim was to evaluate VSMCs from different arterial beds in terms of mechanics and proteomics, as well as investigate factors that may influence this phenotype. VSMCs obtained from seven arteries were studied using optical magnetic twisting cytometry (both in static state and after stretching) and shotgun proteomics. VSMC mechanical data were correlated with anatomical parameters and ultrastructural images of their vessels of origin. Femoral, renal, abdominal aorta, carotid, mammary, and thoracic aorta exhibited descending order of stiffness (G, P < 0.001). VSMC mechanical data correlated with the vessel percentage of elastin and amount of surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), which decreased with the distance from the heart. After 48 h of stretching simulating regional blood flow of elastic arteries, VSMCs exhibited a reduction in basal rigidity. VSMCs from the thoracic aorta expressed a significantly higher amount of proteins related to cytoskeleton structure and organization vs. VSMCs from the femoral artery. VSMCs are heterogeneous in terms of mechanical properties and expression/organization of cytoskeleton proteins along the arterial tree. The mechanical phenotype correlates with the composition of ECM and can be modulated by cyclic stretching imposed on VSMCs by blood flow circumferential stress. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.",Aorta; Extracellular matrix; Smooth muscle cells; Vascular smooth muscle,"aorta; extracellular matrix; smooth muscle cells; vascular smooth muscle; Animals; Arteries; Cell Cycle; Collagen; Elastin; Female; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Proteomics; Sus scrofa"

Liquid bridge ruptures during inhalation are the major cause of the crackling adventitious lung sound, which can be heard using a simple stethoscope. Recently, Vyshedskiy and colleagues (2009) [1] described and characterized a crackle sound originated during expiration. However, the mechanism and origin of the expiratory crackle are still controversial. Thus, in this paper, we propose a mechanism for expiratory crackles. We hypothesize that the expiratory crackle sound is a result of the energy released in the form of acoustic waves during the formation of the liquid bridge. The magnitude of the energy released is proportional to the difference in free energy prior and after the bridge formation. We use a lattice gas model to describe the liquid bridge formation between two parallel planes. Specifically, we determine the surface free energy and the conditions of the liquid bridge formation between two parallel planes separated by a distance 2h by a liquid droplet of volume Ω and contact angle Θ, using both Monte Carlo simulation of a lattice gas model and variational calculus based on minimization of the surface area with the volume and the contact angle constrained. We numerically and analytically determine the phase diagram of the system as a function of the dimensionless parameter hΩ-1/3 and Θ. We can distinguish two different phases: one droplet and one liquid bridge. We observe a hysteresis curve for the energy changes between these two states, and a finite size effect in the bridge formation. We compute the release of free energy during the formation of the liquid bridge and discuss the results in terms of system size. We also calculate the force exerted from liquid bridge on the planes by studying the dependence of the free energy on the separation between the planes 2h. The simulation results are in agreement with the analytical solution. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Possible changes in mechanical properties of cells, caused by illumination, are investigated with optical magnetic twisting cytometry (OMTC), which is a technique used to evaluate mechanical properties in cell culture. Ferromagnetic micro beads are bound to cell cytoskeleton, the beads are magnetized vertically and a horizontal twisting magnetic field is applied causing a torque that moves the beads and deforms the cell, the beads rotate and displace. Based on the lateral displacement of the beads, elastic shear and loss moduli are obtained. Samples of human bronchial epithelial cell culture were divided in two groups: one was illuminated with a 660 nm red laser, 30 mW power, 0.75 W/cm2 irradiance, during different time intervals, and the other one, the control group, was not illuminated. The values of the mechanical constants of the cells of the control group showed a tendency of increasing with the time out of the incubator. On the other hand, the illuminated group showed constancy on the behavior of both moduli, keeping the normal conditions of the cell culture. Those results indicate that illumination can induce cells to homeostasis, and OMTC is sensitive to observe departures from the steady conditions. Hence, OMTC is an important technique which can be used to aggregate knowledge on the light effect in cell cytoskeleton and even on the low level laser therapy mechanisms in inflammatory processes and/or wound healing. © 2013 SPIE.",Cell mechanical properties; Cytoskeleton; Human bronchial epithelial cell culture; LLLT; Low level laser therapy; Low level light therapy; OMTC; Optical magnetic twisting cytometry,Cytoskeletons; Human bronchial epithelial cells; LLLT; Low level laser therapy; Low-level-light; OMTC; Optical magnetic twisting cytometry; Cell culture; Cells; Laser surgery; Mechanical properties; Biomechanics

This works characterizes crackles acquired from patients with fibrosis, heart failure, and pneumonia, breathing at a constant rate, with a system developed according to the CORSA guidelines. Their maximum frequency was obtained by applying discrete pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution, suitable for non-stationary signals, and an objective method to estimate the maximum frequency, the modified geometric method. The effects of the breathing rate and the tidal volume on the spectra of the crackles were also investigated. The role of the high-pass filter cutoff frequency of the acquisition system on the characteristics of the acquired crackles was also assessed in this present study. Higher high-pass filter cutoff frequency allows for higher amplification which modifies the maximum frequency and the 2CD index. It is shown that the crackles acquired according to the CORSA guidelines have higher frequencies and shorter 2CD indexes than those previously reported, highlighting the need for the standardization and detailed report of the acquisition setup when quantifying lung sounds. The results pointed out that the maximum frequency and the 2CD indexes may allow crackles generated by fibrosis to be distinguished from the ones generated by the heart failure and pneumonia. It is not possible, however, by means of these two indexes, to differentiate between pneumonia and heart failure crackles. © 2012 IPEM.",2CD; CORSA; Lung sounds; Maximum frequency; Wigner Ville Distribution,"2CD; Acquisition systems; CORSA; Higher frequencies; Lung sounds; Maximum frequency; Nonstationary signals; Respiratory sounds; Biological organs; Cardiology; Cutoff frequency; High pass filters; Spectrum analysis; Wigner-Ville distribution; Cracks; abnormal respiratory sound; adult; aged; analog digital converter; article; breathing rate; clinical article; computer program; expiratory flow; filter; frequency analysis; heart failure; human; inspiratory capacity; lung fibrosis; mathematical analysis; microphone; pneumonia; pressure transducer; priority journal; quantitative analysis; rale; signal processing; sound transmission; standardization; tidal volume; waveform; Aged; Fibrosis; Heart Failure; Humans; Lung; Middle Aged; Pneumonia; Respiration; Respiratory Sounds; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"

Despite all research in this field, mortality rate still remains around 35%. In this study we used a model of acute lung injury with paraquat, an herbicide that causes alveolar instability through destruction of surfactant, to obtain pressure-volume curves of lungs in open-chest rats. The objectives were to study acute lung injury through measurements of lung elastance during inspiratory and expiratory maneuvers. We observed a rise in elastance during the initial part of the inspiratory maneuver (0-5mL approx.) in animals exposed to paraquat possibly due to increased alveolar collapse. We suppose that alveolar recruitment is responsible for the absence of significant elastance changes in other phases of the inspiratory maneuver. © 2013 Springer.",Acute lung injury; elastance; experimental model; paraquat; pressure-volume curve,Acute lung injury; Elastance; Experimental models; paraquat; Pressure-volume curves; Biological organs; Biomedical engineering; Herbicides

We analyze the overnight sequence of wave packets - the snore sound - recorded during full polysomnography in patients referred to the Sleep Laboratory due to suspected obstructive sleep apnea. We hypothesize that irregular snore, with duration in the range between 10 and 100 s, correlates with respiratory obstructive events. We find that the number of irregular snores - easily accessible, and quantified by what we call the snore time interval index (STII) - is in good agreement with the well-known apnea-hypopnea index, which expresses the severity of obstructive sleep apnea and is extracted only from polysomnography. In addition, the Hurst analysis of the snore sound itself, which calculates the fluctuations in the signal as a function of time interval, is used to build a classifier that is able to distinguish between patients with no or mild apnea and patients with moderate or severe apnea. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Smooth muscle cells (SMC) also change molecularly and morphologically with long term culture. The main objective of this study was to evaluate if culture passages interfere in vascular SMC mechanical behavior. SMC were obtained from five different porcine arterial beds. Optical magnetic twisting cytometry (OMTC) was used to characterize mechanically vascular SMC from different cultures in distinct passages and confocal microscopy/western blotting, to evaluate cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix proteins. We found that vascular SMC rigidity or viscoelastic complex modulus (G) decreases with progression of passages. A statistically significant negative correlation between G and passage was found in four of our five cultures studied. Phalloidin-stained SMC from higher passages exhibited lower mean signal intensity per cell (confocal microscopy) and quantitative western blotting analysis showed a decrease in collagen I content throughout passages. We concluded that vascular SMC progressively lose their stiffness with serial culture passaging. Thus, limiting the number of passages is essential for any experiment measuring viscoelastic properties of SMC in culture. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

The prevalence rates of snoring in the general population are variable, ranging from 20 to 60%. However, all population-based studies used the subjective analysis of snoring evaluated by questionnaires. Snoring is the major reported signal that may indicate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The polysomnography study, which is the golden standard test for the diagnosis of OSA, frequently uses the vibration recording by a sensor located on the patient's neck. However, this signal is not calibrated and has no correlation with sound intensity. To date, there is no consensus on the methodology of the acquisition and analysis of the snore signal. This review article evaluates methodological studies that report on snoring recording equipment and correlate the snoring signal with OSA. Using the keywords ""Snoring"" and ""Obstructive Sleep Apnea"" in PubMed, we found 602 articles, however there were only 11 studies (1.8%) that reported on technical aspects regarding snoring recording and analysis. The selected articles showed a wide variability in the method of recording, as well as analysis of the snoring signal. The lack of technical studies on snoring reflects a major gap in Sleep Medicine. Recent data obtained by objective measurements showed that snoring intensity correlates with OSA severity. In addition, snoring recordings represent a promising new noninvasive tool for the diagnosis of OSA.

In 1819, Laënnec invented the stethoscope and published the first work on pulmonary disorders and their associated sounds. Since then, the auscultation was incorporated into medicine. The first electronic device to record and analyze physiological sounds was built in 1955, being followed by many other developments. In 2000, a task force of the European Respiratory Society established guidelines for computerized respiratory sound analysis (CORSA). Our work describes a low cost microcomputerized system, based on the CORSA guidelines, developed to acquire and record breathing sounds as well as respiratory flow waveforms. It consists of a four channel micro-controlled device that can simultaneously record sounds from three different sources and flow waveform. These signals are transmitted to a microcomputer running dedicated software that shows the waveforms on the screen and stores them into the hard disk.

Although inhalation of these particulates has become a public health concern, human health effects and mechanisms of action for NPs are not well understood. Focusing on the human airway smooth muscle cell, here we show that the cellular mechanical function is altered by particulate exposure in a manner that is dependent upon particle material, size and dose. We used Alamar Blue assay to measure cell viability and optical magnetic twisting cytometry to measure cell stiffness and agonist-induced contractility. The eight particle species fell into four categories, based on their respective effect on cell viability and on mechanical function. Cell viability was impaired and cell contractility was decreased by (i) zinc oxide (40-100 nm and less than 44 mm) and copper(II) oxide (less than 50 nm); cell contractility was decreased by (ii) fluorescent polystyrene spheres (40 nm), increased by (iii) welding fumes and unchanged by (iv) diesel exhaust particles, titanium dioxide (25 nm) and copper(II) oxide (less than 5 μm), although in none of these cases was cell viability impaired. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide up to 500 μM did not alter viability or cell mechanics, suggesting that the particle effects are unlikely to be mediated by particle-generated reactive oxygen species. Our results highlight the susceptibility of cellular mechanical function to particulate exposures and suggest that direct exposure of the airway smooth muscle cells to particulates may initiate or aggravate respiratory diseases. © 2010 The Royal Society.",Air pollution; Cell mechanics; Environmental health; Mechanobiology; Nanoparticles,"Air quality; Biomechanics; Cytology; Environmental engineering; Fumes; Health; Hydrogen peroxide; Mechanisms; Muscle; Nanoparticles; Oxygen; Pollution; Polystyrenes; Titanium; Titanium dioxide; Titanium oxides; Zinc; Zinc oxide; Airway smooth muscle cell; Ambient particles; Biomechanical effects; Cell mechanics; Cell stiffness; Cell viability; Copper (ii); Diesel exhaust particles; Environmental health; Human airway smooth muscle cells; Human health effects; Mechanical functions; Mechano-biology; Nano-sized; Nanotechnology industry; Optical magnetic twisting cytometry; Particle effect; Particle materials; Polystyrene spheres; Public health; Reactive oxygen species; Respiratory disease; Welding fumes; Cells; copper oxide; hydrogen peroxide; nanoparticle; polystyrene; reactive oxygen metabolite; titanium dioxide; zinc oxide; copper; cuprous oxide; nanoparticle; oxazine derivative; polystyrene derivative; resazurin; titanium; xanthene derivative; zinc oxide; air pollution; article; breathing muscle; cell function; cell viability; controlled study; environmental health; exhaust gas; human; human cell; particulate matter; smooth muscle fiber; welding fume; analysis of variance; biomechanics; cell line; cell survival; cytology; drug effect; exhaust gas; physiology; respiratory system; Analysis of Variance; Biomechanics; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Copper; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Nanoparticles; Oxazines; Polystyrenes; Respiratory System; Titanium; Vehicle Emissions; Xanthenes; Zinc Oxide"

To fill this gap, here we provide detailed intracellular maps of regional cytoskeleton (CSK) stiffness, loss tangent, and rate of structural rearrangements, as well as their relationships to the underlying regional F-actin density and the local cytoskeletal prestress. In the human airway smooth muscle cell, we used micropatterning to minimize geometric variation. We measured the local cell stiffness and loss tangent with optical magnetic twisting cytometry and the local rate of CSK remodeling with spontaneous displacements of a CSK-bound bead. We also measured traction distributions with traction microscopy and cell geometry with atomic force microscopy. On the basis of these experimental observations, we used finite element methods to map for the first time the regional distribution of intracellular prestress. Compared with the cell center or edges, cell corners were systematically stiffer and more fluidlike and supported higher traction forces, and at the same time had slower remodeling dynamics. Local remodeling dynamics had a close inverse relationship with local cell stiffness. The principal finding, however, is that systematic regional variations of CSK stiffness correlated only poorly with regional F-actin density but strongly and linearly with the regional prestress. Taken together, these findings in the intact cell comprise the most comprehensive characterization to date of regional variations of cytoskeletal mechanical properties and their determinants.

In this study we describe the cytoskeleton as a simple network of filamentary proteins (links) anchored by complex protein structures (nodes). The structure of this network is regulated by a distance-dependent probability of link formation as P = p / ds, where p regulates the network density and s controls how fast the probability for link formation decays with node distance (d). It was previously shown that the regulation of the link lengths is crucial for the mechanical behavior of the cells. Here we examined the ability of the two-dimensional network to percolate (i.e. to have end-to-end connectivity), and found that the percolation threshold depends strongly on s. The system undergoes a transition around s = 2. The percolation threshold of networks with s &lt; 2 decreases with increasing system size L, while the percolation threshold for networks with s &gt; 2 converges to a finite value. We speculate that s &lt; 2 may represent a condition in which cells can accommodate deformation while still preserving their mechanical integrity. Additionally, we measured the length distribution of F-actin filaments from publicly available images of a variety of cell types. In agreement with model predictions, cells originating from more deformable tissues show longer F-actin cytoskeletal filaments. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This power law is also influenced by mechanical prestress borne by the cytoskeleton, suggesting that cytoskeletal prestress determines the cell's viscoelasticity, but the biophysical origins of this behavior are largely unknown. We have recently developed a stochastic two-dimensional model of an elastically joined chain that links the power-law rheology to the prestress. Here we use a similar approach to study the creep response of a prestressed three-dimensional elastically jointed chain as a viscoelastic model of semiflexible polymers that comprise the prestressed cytoskeletal lattice. Using a Monte Carlo based algorithm, we show that numerical simulations of the chain's creep behavior closely correspond to the behavior observed experimentally in living cells. The power-law creep behavior results from a finite-speed propagation of free energy from the chain's end points toward the center of the chain in response to an externally applied stretching force. The property that links the power law to the prestress is the chain's stiffening with increasing prestress, which originates from entropic and enthalpic contributions. These results indicate that the essential features of cellular rheology can be explained by the viscoelastic behaviors of individual semiflexible polymers of the cytoskeleton. © 2008 The American Physical Society.",,ABS resins; Cells; Colloids; Creep; Cytology; Elasticity; Plasticity; Polymers; Pressure effects; Rheology; Stochastic models; Three dimensional; Viscoelasticity; Viscosity; Adherent cells; Creep behaviors; Creep responses; Cytoskeletal; Cytoskeleton; Dimensional models; End points; Essential features; Living cells; Monte carlo; Numerical simulations; Physiological functions; Power laws; Pre stresses; Prestressed; Rheological properties; Semiflexible chains; Semiflexible polymers; Stretching forces; Time scales; Viscoelastic behaviors; Viscoelastic models; Viscoelastic responses; Physiological models

During inhalation, these liquid bridges may rupture due to mechanical instability and emit a discrete sound event called pulmonary crackle, which can be heard using a simple stethoscope. We hypothesize that this sound is a result of the acoustical release of energy that had been stored in the surface of liquid bridges prior to its rupture. We develop a lattice gas model capable of describing these phenomena. As a step toward modeling this process, we address a simpler but related problem, that of a liquid bridge between two planar surfaces. This problem has been analytically solved and we use this solution as a validation of the lattice gas model of the liquid bridge rupture. Specifically, we determine the surface free energy and critical stability conditions in a system containing a liquid bridge of volume Ω formed between two parallel planes, separated by a distance 2h, with a contact angle Θ using both Monte Carlo simulation of a lattice gas model and variational calculus based on minimization of the surface area with the volume and the contact angle constraints. In order to simulate systems with different contact angles, we vary the parameters between the constitutive elements of the lattice gas. We numerically and analytically determine the phase diagram of the system as a function of the dimensionless parameters h Ω-1/3 and Θ. The regions of this phase diagram correspond to the mechanical stability and thermodynamical stability of the liquid bridge. We also determine the conditions for the symmetrical versus asymmetrical rupture of the bridge. We numerically and analytically compute the release of free energy during rupture. The simulation results are in agreement with the analytical solution. Furthermore, we discuss the results in connection to the rupture of similar bridges that exist in diseased lungs. © 2006 The American Physical Society.",,Biomedical equipment; Computer simulation; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Problem solving; Pulmonary diseases; Lattice gas models; Liquid bridges; Mechanical stability; Biomedical engineering

However, in recent years, it is most commonly used as an index for characterizing the enlargement of airspaces in emphysema and the associated severity of structural destruction in the lung. Specifically, an increase in Lm is thought to result from an increase in airspace sizes. In this paper, we examined how accurately Lm measures the linear dimensions of airspaces from histological sections and a variety of computer-generated test images. To this end, we developed an automated method for measuring linear intercepts from digitized images of tissue sections and calculate Lm as their mean. We examined how the shape of airspaces and the variability of their sizes influence Lm as well as the distribution of linear intercepts. We found that, for a relatively homogeneous enlargement of airspaces, Lm was a reliable index for detecting emphysema. However, in the presence of spatial heterogeneities with a large variability of airspace sizes, Lm did not significantly increase and sometimes even decreased compared with its value in normal tissue. We also developed an automated method for measuring the area and computed an equivalent diameter of each individual airspace that is independent of shape. Finally, we introduced new indexes based on the moments of diameter that we found to be more reliable than Lm to characterize airspace enlargement in the presence of heterogeneities.

We define the active surface of the lung as the set of airway segments that are closed but connected to the trachea through an open pathway, which is the interface between closed and open regions in a collapsed lung. To study the active surface and the time interval between consecutive openings, we measured the sound pressure of crackles, associated with the opening of collapsed airway segments in isolated dog lungs, inflating from the collapsed state in 120 s. We analyzed the sequence of crackle amplitudes, inter-crackle intervals, and low frequency energy from acoustic data. The series of spike amplitudes spans two orders of magnitude and the inter-crackle intervals spans over five orders of magnitude. The distribution of spike amplitudes follows a power law for nearly two decades, while the distribution of time intervals between consecutive crackles shows two regimes of power law behavior, where the first region represents crackles coming from avalanches of openings whereas the second region is due to the time intervals between separate avalanches. Using the time interval between measured crackles, we estimated the time evolution of the active surface during lung inflation. In addition, we show that recruitment and instabilities along the pressure-volume curve are associated with airway opening and recruitment. We find a good agreement between the theory of the dynamics of lung inflation and the experimental data which combined with numerical results may prove useful in the clinical diagnosis of lung diseases. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The glycosaminoglycans on the proteoglycans may also play a role because osmolarity of interstitial fluid can alter the repulsive forces on the negatively charged glycosaminoglycans, allowing them to collapse or inflate, which can affect the stretching and folding pattern of the fibers. Hence, we hypothesized that the elasticity of lung tissue arises primarily from 1) the topology of the collagen-elastin network and 2) the mechanical interaction between proteoglycans and fibers. We measured the quasi-static, uniaxial stress-strain curves of lung tissue sheets in hypotonic, normal, and hypertonic solutions. We found that the stress-strain curve was sensitive to osmolarity, but this sensitivity decreased after proteoglycan digestion. Images of immunofluorescently labeled collagen networks showed that the fibers follow the alveolar walls that form a hexagonal-like structure. Despite the large heterogeneity, the aspect ratio of the hexagons at 30% uniaxial strain increased linearly with osmolarity. We developed a two-dimensional hexagonal network model of the alveolar structure incorporating the mechanical properties of the collagen-elastin fibers and their interaction with proteoglycans. The model accounted for the stress-strain curves observed under all experimental conditions. The model also predicted how aspect ratio changed with osmolarity and strain, which allowed us to estimate the Young's modulus of a single alveolar wall and a collagen fiber. We therefore identify a novel and important role for the proteoglycans: they stabilize the collagen-elastin network of connective tissues and contribute to lung elasticity and alveolar stability at low to medium lung volumes.",Fluorescent imaging; Glycosaminoglycans; Network; Stiffness; Stress-strain,"collagen; collagen fiber; elastin; glycosaminoglycan; proteoglycan; article; immunofluorescence; interstitial fluid; lung alveolus wall; lung collapse; lung compliance; lung inflation; lung parenchyma; male; nonhuman; osmolarity; physical stress; priority journal; protein protein interaction; rat; stress strain relationship; stretching; Animals; Biomechanics; Collagen; Computer Simulation; Elasticity; Lung; Lung Compliance; Male; Models, Biological; Osmotic Pressure; Proteoglycans; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Stress, Mechanical"

In isolated dog lung lobes, the pressure-volume loops were measured, and crackle sounds were recorded intrabronchially during both the first inflation from the collapsed state to total lobe capacity and a second inflation without prior degassing. The inflation flow contained transients that were accompanied by a series of crackles. Discrete volume increments were estimated from the flow transients, and the energy levels of the corresponding crackles were calculated from the sound recordings. Crackles were concentrated in the early phase of inflation, with the cumulative energy exceeding 90% of its final value by the lower knee of the pressure-volume curve. The values of volume increments were correlated with crackle energy during the flow transient for both the first and the second inflations (r2 = 0.29-0.73 and 0.68-0.82, respectively). Because the distribution of volume increments followed a power law, the correlation between crackle energy and discrete volume increments suggests that an avalanche-like airway opening process governs the recruitment of collapsed normal lungs.",Airway closure; Avalanches; Pressure-volume curve,acoustics; airway dynamics; airway obstruction; airway pressure; animal tissue; article; crackle sound; dog; lung alveolus; lung collapse; lung inflation; lung lobe; lung pressure; lung volume; nonhuman; pressure volume curve; priority journal; sound; sound pressure; Animals; Atelectasis; Bronchi; Dogs; Elasticity; Lung Volume Measurements; Pressure; Pulmonary Alveoli; Respiratory Sounds

We measured the input impedance of isolated lungs at three levels of transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) and used a linear model to estimate the dynamic elastance and hysteresivity of the lungs. The elastance of the normal lungs increased steeply with Ptp, whereas this dependence diminished in the treated lungs. Hysteresivity decreased significantly with Ptp in the normal lungs, but this dependence disappeared in the treated lungs. To investigate the microscopic origins of these changes, the alveolar walls were immunofluorescently labeled in small tissue strips. By using a fluorescent microscope, the lengths and angular orientations of individual alveolar walls were followed during cyclic uniaxial stretching of the tissue strips. The microstrains (relative change in segment length) and changes in angle of the alveolar walls showed considerable heterogeneity, which was interpreted in terms of a network model. In the normal strips, the alveolar walls showed larger angular changes compared with the treated tissue, whereas the alveolar walls of the treated tissue tended to be more extensible. Hysteresis in the average angle change was also larger in the treated tissue than in the normal tissue. We conclude that the decreased Ptp dependence of elastance and the constant hysteresivity in the treated lungs are related to microstructural remodeling and network phenomena at the level of the alveolar walls.",Collagen; Elastin; Fluorescent imaging; Mechanics; Remodeling,"collagen; elastase; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; elasticity; emphysema; fluorescence microscopy; hysteresis; immunofluorescence; impedance; in vivo study; isolated lung; lung alveolus wall; lung mechanics; lung pressure; lung structure; male; microstructure remodeling; network phenomenon; nonhuman; phenomenology; priority journal; rat; statistical model; Animals; Collagen; Disease Models, Animal; Elasticity; Emphysema; Male; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Models, Biological; Pancreatic Elastase; Pulmonary Alveoli; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Respiratory Mechanics; Stress, Mechanical"

After 3 h of ventilation, each animal underwent whole lung lavage for determination of alveolar surfactant content and composition, while protein content was assayed as a possible marker of injury. Another group of animals underwent whole lung lavage in the absence of mechanical ventilation to serve as an unventilated control group (n = 5). Although lung mechanics did not vary significantly between groups, we found that variable ventilation improved oxygenation, increased surfactant levels nearly twofold, and attenuated alveolar protein content compared with animals ventilated with constant VT.

The impedance data were fit with a model to obtain regional tissue elastance (Eti) as a function of inflation. First, Eti was high and decreased in discrete jumps as more groups of alveoli were recruited. By assuming that the number of opened alveoli is inversely proportional to Eti, we calculated from the jumps in Eti the distribution of the discrete increments in the number of opened alveoli.

The agreement between experiments and simulations suggests that (i) the irregularities are a consequence of structural heterogeneity in the lung, (ii) the intermittent behavior is due to the avalanchelike opening, and (iii) the scaling is a result of successive attenuations acting on the sound spikes as they propagate through a cascade of bifurcations along the airway tree.",,article

We examined the statistical properties of LAA clusters in COPD patients and in healthy subjects. In COPD patients, the percentage of the lung field occupied by LAAs (LAA%) ranged from 2.6 to 67.6. In contrast, LAA% was always <30% in healthy subjects. The cumulative size distribution of the LAA clusters followed a power law characterized by an exponent D. We show that D is a measure of the complexity of the terminal airspace geometry. The COPD patients with normal LAA% had significantly smaller D values than the healthy subjects, and the D values did not correlate with pulmonary function tests except for the diffusing capacity of the lung. We interpret these results by using a large elastic spring network model and find that the neighboring smaller LAA clusters tend to coalesce and form larger clusters as the weak elastic fibers separating them break under tension. This process leaves LAA% unchanged whereas it decreases the number of small clusters and increases the number of large clusters, which results in a reduction in D similar to that observed in early emphysema patients. These findings suggest that D is a sensitive and powerful parameter for the detection of the terminal airspace enlargement that occurs in early emphysema.",,"airway dynamics; article; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; elasticity; geometry; high resolution computer tomography; human; human cell; human tissue; image analysis; major clinical study; priority journal; respiratory airflow; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Lung; Lung Diseases, Obstructive; Reference Values; Respiratory Function Tests; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Vital Capacity"

We show that, for a fully symmetric tree with n generations (n ≥ 3), the flow distribution becomes significantly heterogeneous at an increased Reynolds number. We develop a binary tree model and find that the distribution of flow at the outlet branches can be described by a self-affine landscape, with a self-affine exponent α = 0.9 for the human lung. We suggest that the asymmetric flow occurring in symmetric branched structures may be important both for the morphogenesis of the bronchial tree, and for its functioning during inspiration.",,

Maxwell equations are solved with appropriate boundary conditions to calculate the dispersion relation of bulk longitudinal-optical (LO) and surface-optical (SO) phonons The Hamiltonian that describes the electron-phonon interaction is obtained through a quantum treatment and a perturbation theory up to the second order is used to calculate the ground-state energy of confined polarons. Numerical results are obtained for the dispersion relation, the electron-phonon coupling function, and the ground-state energy of polarons in GaAs films. It is shown that the charged interfaces do not change the volume modes of a GaAs film, but alter significantly its surface modes. The dispersion relation of SO phonons, the electron-phonon coupling function, and the ground-state energy of the polaron depend on the surface charge density, as well as on the film thickness.",,

This self-tuning behavior around a critical state is then discussed with reference to the concept of self-organized criticality. We also suggest that the generalization of this approach to other controlling rules and lattice geometries could explain the occurrence of percolation structures in some physical and nonphysical disordered systems.",,

By incorporating a dynamical rule which simply regulates the flux of monomers available for aggregation, the system is spontaneously driven to the critical branching probability which separates the finite from infinite growth regimes. The fact that the system reaches and maintains itself close to a critical state without the need of a fine tuning of the parameters is thus discussed in terms of the self-organized criticality (SOC) concept. Finally, we also demonstrate the feasibility of the method in association with a practical implementation of the theoretical model.",,Agglomeration; Growth (materials); Mathematical models; Monomers; Probability; Branched polymers; Critical branching probability; Polymers

It is shown that the electron-hole interaction increases the rate of dissipation of the excess energy of the minority carriers in the early stages of the process. However, this channel for energy dissipation becomes weaker as the cooling of the minority carriers proceeds, an effect more noticeable in the case of high doping levels. When the electron-hole interaction is disregarded, the dissipation rate is always smaller for low doping concentrations.",,
