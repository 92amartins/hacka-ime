The choice of a zirconium based intermediate layer follows from its ecologic sustainability − decreased water and energy consumption, vehicle weight reduction, and low byproduct generation during processing. Here we describe our investigations of a characterization method of converted metal oxide thin films deposited by a plasma method. The thin film composition was characterized by Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) before and after conversion by a zirconium-based pretreatment, revealing the formation of zirconia after treatment. The corrosion mechanism of the deposited metal oxide films was investigated using electrochemical analysis, confirming the susceptibility of the film to corrosion and the applicability of corrosion investigations. The results pointed to a better performance of the RBS in comparison to EDS. © 2016 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",Corrosion; Pretreatment; RBS; Zirconium,Alloy steel; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum coatings; Characterization; Corrosion; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Energy utilization; Metallic compounds; Metals; Oxide films; Rubidium; Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy; Zirconia; Zirconium; Characterization methods; Ecologic sustainability; Electrochemical analysis; Energy dispersive spectroscopies (EDS); Metal oxide thin films; Pre-Treatment; Thin film composition; Vehicle weight reductions; Thin films

We have investigated nanocomposites produced by metal ion implantation into insulating substrates, where the implanted metal self-assembles into nanoparticles. The nanoparticles nucleate near the maximum of the implantation depth profile (projected range), which can be estimated by computer simulation using the TRIDYN code. TRIDYN is a Monte Carlo simulation program based on the TRIM (Transport and Range of Ions in Matter) code that takes into account compositional changes in the substrate due to two factors: previously implanted dopant atoms, and sputtering of the substrate surface. Our study show that the nanoparticles form a bidimentional array buried a few nanometers below the substrate surface. We have studied Au/PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate), Pt/PMMA, Ti/alumina and Au/alumina systems. Transmission electron microscopy of the implanted samples show that metallic nanoparticles form in the insulating matrix. These nanocomposites have been characterized by measuring the resistivity of the composite layer as a function of the implantation dose. The experimental results are compared with a model based on percolation theory, in which electron transport through the composite is explained by conduction through a random resistor network formed by the metallic nanoparticles. Excellent agreement is found between the experimental results and the predictions of the theory. We conclude in that the conductivity process is due only to percolation (when the conducting elements are in geometric contact) and that the contribution from tunneling conduction is negligible. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Ion implantation; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Surface modification,Computer simulation; Insulation; Metal ions; Metal nanoparticles; Metallic matrix composites; Monte Carlo methods; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Solvents; Substrates; Surface treatment; Transmission electron microscopy; Compositional changes; Conductivity process; Insulating substrates; Metallic nanoparticles; Monte- carlo simulations; Random resistor networks; Surface electrical conductivity; Transport and range of ions in matters; Ion implantation

The implanted titanium self-conglomerates into nanoparticles, and the spatial dimensions of the buried nanocomposite layer can thus be estimated from the implantation depth profile. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry was performed to measure the implantation depth profile, and was in good agreement with the calculated profile. Transmission electron microscopy of the titanium-implanted alumina was used for direct visualization of the nanoparticles formed. The measured conductivity of the buried layer is explained by percolation theory. We determine that the saturation dose, φ0, the maximum implantation dose for which the nanocomposite material still remains a composite, is φ0-=-2.2-×-1016-cm-2, and the corresponding saturation conductivity is σ0-=-480-S/m. The percolation dose φc, below which the nanocomposite still has basically the conductivity of the alumina matrix, was found to be φc-=-0.84-×-1016-cm-2.

The basic concept of autologous TE is to isolate cells from small biopsy specimens, and to expand these cells in culture for subsequent seeding onto biodegradable scaffolds. Nanocrystalline diamond films have attracted the attention of researchers from a variety of different areas in recent years, due to their unique and exceptional properties. In this approach, human dental stem cells (hDSCs) were characterized by flow cytometry and grown on diamond films with hydrogen (H)-terminated and oxygen (O)-terminated surfaces for 28 days, and then removed by lysis and washing with distilled water. Energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis was performed, showing that the regions with O-terminated surfaces contained much higher levels of deposited calcium, oxygen, and phosphorus. These results suggest that the extracellular matrix was considerably more developed in the O-terminated regions, as compared with the H-terminated regions. In addition, optical microscopy of hDSCs cultured on the diamond substrate with H-and O-terminated surfaces, before washing with distilled water, showed preferential directions of the cells arrangement, where orthogonal lines suggest that the cells appeared to be following the O-terminated regions or hydrophilic surface. These findings suggest that O-terminated diamond surfaces prepared on biodegradable scaffolds can be useful for mineralized dental tissue formation. © 2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"Cytology; Diamond films; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Hydrophilicity; Oxygen; Stem cells; Washing; Basic concepts; Biodegradable scaffold; Diamond substrates; Diamond surfaces; Distilled water; Extracellular matrices; Hydrophilic surfaces; Nanocrystalline diamond films; Scaffolds (biology); calcium; diamond; hydrogen; mannitol; nanocrystal; oxygen; phosphorus; article; cell growth; cell population; cell structure; dental stem cell; extracellular matrix; flow cytometry; human; human cell; human tissue; hydrophilicity; molar tooth; priority journal; stem cell; surface property; tissue engineering; tooth; tooth development; Cells, Cultured; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Nanodiamonds; Stem Cells; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Tooth"

Here, we discuss the limits of validity of the model, and explore the application of the model to surfaces fabricated with small cavities of radius 250 nm and with large cavities of radius 40 μm. The Wenzel model is discussed and used to calculate the advancing and receding contact angles for samples for which our model cannot be applied. We also consider the case of immersion of a sample containing microcavities in pressurized water. A consideration that then arises is that the air inside the cavities can be dissolved in the water, leading to complete water invasion into the cavities and compromising the superhydrophobic character of the surface. Here, we show that this effect does not destroy the surface hydrophobia when the surface is subsequently removed from the water. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",,Advancing and receding contact angles; Large cavities; Pressurized water; Small cavities; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Superhydrophobic; Water invasion; Wenzel models; Contact angle; Hydrophobicity; Surface properties; Microcavities

The Au ion energy was 40 keV and the dose spanned the range 2.7-8.9 × 1016 cm-2. Imaging of the implanted material by transmission electron microscopy revealed that the implanted gold self-assembles into nanoparticles, thus forming a gold-alumina nano-composite. The surface resistivity measurements were compared with the predictions of a model based on percolation theory, in which electron transport through the composite is explained by conduction through a random resistor network formed by the Au nanoparticles. The electrical conductivity of a composite, near the critical conductor-insulator transition, is given by σ ≈ σ0(x- xc)t, where σ0 is the saturation conductivity for which the material still remains a composite, x is the normalized metal atom concentration of the conducting phase, xc is the critical concentration, or percolation threshold and t is the critical exponent. Excellent agreement was found between the experimental results and the predictions of the theory, and the results are consistent with prior related (but more limited) work. The percolation dose was 4.4 × 1016 cm-2, and the critical exponent obtained was t = 1.4 ± 0.1.

The diamond films were deposited by microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition, which naturally produces hydrogen terminations on the surface of the films formed. Selected regions were patterned by electron-beam lithography and chemical terminations of oxygen or fluorine were created by exposure to an oxygen or fluorine plasma source. For KFM imaging, the samples were mounted in a hood with a constant flow of helium gas. Successive images were taken over a 5-h period showing the effect of the environment on KFM imaging. We conclude that the helium flow removes water molecules adsorbed on the surface of the samples, resulting in differences in surface potential between adjacent regions. The degree of water removal is different for surfaces with different terminations.

The technique allows for the incorporation of a wide layer of metallic nanoparticles into a polymer matrix, such as PMMA. The ability to pattern different structures using the PMMA matrix is one of the main advantages of the fabrication method. This opens up new possibilities for obtaining tailored substrates with enhanced performance for SERS and other surface-enhanced spectroscopies, as well as for exploring the basic physics of patterned metal nanostructures. The architecture of the SERS-active substrate was varied using three adsorption strategies for incorporating a laser dye (rhodamine): alongside the nanoparticles into the polymer matrix, during the polymer cure and within nanoholes lithographed on the polymer. As a proof-of-concept, we obtained the SERS spectra of rhodamine for the three types of substrates. The hypothesis of incorporation of rhodamine molecules into the polymer matrix during the cathodic arc plasma ion implantation was supported by FDTD (Finite-Difference Time-Domain) simulations. In the case of arrays of nanoholes, rhodamine molecules could be adsorbed directly on the gold surface, then yielding a well-resolved SERS spectrum for a small amount of analyte owing to the short-range interactions and the large longitudinal field component inside the nanoholes. The results shown here demonstrate that the approach based on ion implantation can be adapted to produce reproducible tailored substrates for SERS and other surface-enhanced spectroscopies. © 2012 the Owner Societies.",,"gold; metal nanoparticle; poly(methyl methacrylate); rhodamine; article; chemistry; electrode; Raman spectrometry; Electrodes; Gold; Metal Nanoparticles; Polymethyl Methacrylate; Rhodamines; Spectrum Analysis, Raman"

Roughness and gloss were analyzed with ANOVA and Tukey's t-test. Results: No statistical difference was found for Ra and RMS among initial, after bleaching and after polishing in both groups. For Z range, Group nHA showed a significant decrease after polishing. Bleaching with 38% HP did not increase the PSD in the spatial frequency of the visible light spectrum range in both groups. After polishing, nHA group showed a decrease in PSD for all morphological wavelengths. Gloss did not show statistical difference after bleaching in both groups. Gloss showed significant increase after polishing with nHA. Significance: bleaching treatment with 38% HP didn't alter enamel surface roughness or gloss. PSD analyses were very suitable to identifying the morphological changes on the surfaces. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Dental bleaching; Gloss; Power spectral density; Surface analyses,"fluoride; hydrogen peroxide; hydroxyapatite; tooth bleaching agent; article; atomic force microscopy; drug effect; human; metabolism; physiology; spectrophotometry; surface property; tooth; Durapatite; Fluorides; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Spectrophotometry; Surface Properties; Tooth; Tooth Bleaching Agents"

In accelerator injection application, the beam from the ion source may be accelerated further (post-acceleration), redirected by a bending magnet(s), or focused with magnetic or electrostatic lenses, and knowledge of the beam space charge is needed for optimal design of the optical elements. In ion implantation application, any build-up of positive charge in the insulating targets must be compensated by a simultaneous flux of cold electrons so as to provide overall charge neutrality of the target. We show that in line-of-sight ion implantation using a vacuum arc ion source, the high current ion beam carries along its own background sea of cold electrons, and this copious source of electrons provides a ""self-neutralizing"" feature to the beam.

Background: Lasers have been used for various purposes in dentistry, where they are clinically effective when used in an appropriate manner. The Er,Cr:YSGG laser can be used for caries prevention when settings are below the ablation threshold. Materials and Methods: Four specimens of bovine dentin were irradiated using an Er,Cr:YSGG laser (λ=2.78μm), at a repetition rate of 20Hz, with a 750-μm-diameter sapphire tip and energy density of 2.8J/cm2 (12.5mJ/pulse). After irradiation, surface topography was analyzed by AFM using a Si probe in tapping mode. Quantitative and qualitative information concerning the arithmetic average roughness (Ra) and power spectral density analyses were obtained from central, intermediate, and peripheral areas of laser pulses and compared with data from nonirradiated samples. Results: Dentin Ra for different areas were as follows: central, 261.26 (±21.65) nm; intermediate, 83.48 (±6.34) nm; peripheral, 45.8 (±13.47) nm; and nonirradiated, 35.18 (±2.9) nm. The central region of laser pulses presented higher ablation of intertubular dentin, with about 340-760nm height, while intermediate, peripheral, and nonirradiated regions presented no difference in height of peritubular and interperitubular dentin. Conclusion: According to these results, we can assume that even when used at a low-energy density parameter, Er,Cr:YSGG laser can significantly alter the microtopography of radicular dentin, which is an important characteristic to be considered when laser is used for clinical applications. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011.",,"Ablation thresholds; AFM; Bovine dentin; Caries prevention; Clinical application; Energy density; Energy density distributions; Er ,Cr:YSGG laser; Low energies; Micro topography; Power spectral density analysis; Qualitative information; Repetition rate; Surface microtopography; Tapping modes; Ablation; Atomic force microscopy; Erbium; Laser pulses; Power spectral density; Surface topography; Surfaces; Chromium; analysis of variance; animal; article; atomic force microscopy; cattle; dental caries; dentin; in vitro study; laser; radiation exposure; scanning electron microscopy; surface property; tooth root; ultrastructure; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Cattle; Dental Caries; Dentin; Lasers; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Surface Properties; Tooth Root"

This surface morphology is the inverse of that generally reported in the literature when the surface is formed of pillars or protrusions, and has the advantage that when immersed in water the confined air inside the cavities tends to expel the invading water. This differs from the case of a surface morphology formed of pillars or protrusions, for which water can penetrate irreversibly among the microstructures, necessitating complete drying of the surface in order to again recover its superhydrophobic character. We have developed a theoretical model that allows calculation of the microcavity dimensions needed to obtain superhydrophobic surfaces composed of patterns of such microcavities, and that provides estimates of the advancing and receding contact angle as a function of microcavity parameters. The model predicts that the cavity aspect ratio (depth-to-diameter ratio) can be much less than unity, indicating that the microcavities do not need to be deep in order to obtain a surface with enhanced superhydrophobic character. Specific microcavity patterns have been fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and contact angle measurements.

The reference wafer was only submitted to a chemical cleaning. It was possible to see that the final roughness and the sp3 hybridization degree (that is related with the structure and chemical composition) strongly depend on the substrate surface conditions. The surface roughness was observed by AFM and SEM and the hybridization degree of the DLC films was analyzed by Raman Spectroscopy. Thus, the effects of the substrate surface on the DLC film structure were confirmed.

These unpolished surfaces were subjected to bleaching procedure with 35% hydrogen peroxide that consisted of 4 applications of the bleaching agent on enamel surfaces for 10 min each application. Surface images were obtained in a 15 μm × 15 μm area using an AFM. The roughness (Ra and RMS) and the power spectral density (PSD) were obtained before and after the bleaching treatment. As results we could inquire that the PSD analyses were very suitable to identifying the morphological changes on the surfaces, while the Ra and RMS parameters were insufficient to represent the morphological alterations promoted by bleaching procedure on enamel.

The technique employs an atomic force microscope in a mode in which the tip moves only in the z (vertical) direction and the sample surface is sloped. As the tip moves vertically on the sloped surface, lateral tip slipping occurs, allowing the cantilever vertical deflection and the frictional (lateral) force to be monitored as a function of tip vertical deflection. The advantage of the approach is that cantilever calibration to obtain its spring constants is not necessary. Using this method, the authors have measured friction coefficients, for load range 0<L<6 μN, of 0.047±0.002 for Si on Si, 0.0173±0.0009 for Si on DLC, and 0.0080±0.0005 for DLC on DLC.

Human molars were embedded in resin and sliced for this study. The surface abrasion was performed by a high-speed instrument and ultrasound. The cavity preparation was initially performed with a high-speed diamond bur. After this, a 2.94-μm laser with 400 mJ/pulse at 4 Hz, and a pulse width from 250-500 μs was applied to the tooth surface for 30 s in a sweeping motion. The samples were analyzed by SEM. The abrasion surface with a conventional bur showed structure removal with different grooves, a smear-layer presence, and occluded dentinal tubules. The abraded surface with the CVD bur suggested a removal process in layers. The laser-irradiated surface showed a rough aspect with opened tubules and the absence of a smear layer. The results of this study suggest that a high-speed diamond bur, ultrasound, and laser were able to perform cavity preparation.

The technique used to fabricate the micronozzles was powder blasting. The microvalves are actuators made from PVDF (polivinylidene fluoride), that is a piezoelectric polymer. The micronozzles have convergent-divergent shape with external diameter of 1mm and throat around 230μm. The polymer have low piezoelectric coefficient, for this reason a bimorph structure with dimensions of 2mm width and 4mm of length was build (two piezoelectric sheets were glued together with opposite polarization). Both sheets are recovered with a conductor thin film used as electrodes. Applying a voltage between the electrodes one sheet expands while the other contracts and this generate a vertical movement to the entire actuator. Appling +300V DC between the electrodes the volume flux rate, for a pressure ratio of 0.5, was 0.36 sccm. Applying -200V DC between the electrodes (that means it closed) the volume flux rate was 0.32 sccm, defining a possible range of flow between 0.32 and 0.36 sccm. The third measurement was performed using AC voltage (200V AC with frequency of 1Hz), where the actuator was oscillating.

The device was incorporated with a micronozzle fabricated by a powder blasting technique. Upon applying a DC voltage across the actuator electrodes, one sheet expands while the other contracts, generating an opening motion. A voltage of +300V DC was used to open the device by moving the actuator 30νm, and a voltage of -200V DC was used to close the device by moving the actuator 20νm lower than the relaxed position. Flow measurements were performed in a low-pressure vacuum system, maintaining the microvalve inlet pressure constant at 266Pa. Tests carried out with the actuator in the open position and with a pressure ratio (inlet pressure divided by outlet pressure) of 0.5, indicated a flow rate of 0.36sccm.

Two particular cases are analyzed with this formalism: (1) films with isotropic surfaces and (2) films with anisotropic surfaces which have different morphological properties along two orthogonal directions. It is shown that, depending on the differences between these morphological properties, the surface-induced resistivities can be different along these directions. In order to investigate the validity of these predictions we have fabricated Pt films, with thickness in the 0.90 ≤ d ≤ 11.10 nm range, with very different morphological properties along two orthogonal directions.

The morphological and crystallographic grain sizes of these films have been measured as a function of their thickness. The techniques used for the analyses were scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray diffraction. We showed that the crystallographic grain sizes saturate for large thickness. For Pt films, the saturation occurs for thickness about 100 nm, with a maximum grain size around 23 nm. For Au films, this saturation occurs for thickness about 140 nm, and maximum grain size around 48 nm. It was also verified that both platinum and gold films grow preferentially in the direction (111). This effect was observed for silicon and glass substrates, showing that the films growing process is self-orientated. The morphological grain sizes, for both platinum and gold films, increase rapidly in the region with thickness lower than 4 nm. In the range of thickness between 4 and 45 nm, the morphological grain sizes become constant, about 13-15 nm. For film thickness higher than 45 nm, the morphological grain sizes increase as the thickness increases. These results show that, for d&gt;45 nm, the morphological grain sizes D(d) increases with d, differently of the crystallographic grain sizes Dc(d) that saturate.

The precise mechanism that leads to the transfer of macromolecules through the cell envelope is not yet clear, however it has been observed that the ion bombardment is accompanied by the formation of ""microcraters"" on the cell wall, and it is possible that these features provide channels for the macromolecule transfer. Thus the nature and origin of the microcraters is of importance to understanding the DNA transfer phenomenon as well as being of fundamental interest. We report here on some scanning electron microscope observations we have made of onion skin cells that have been subjected to electron beam bombardment of sufficiently high power density to damage the cell wall. The damage seen is much less than and different from the microcraters formed subsequent to ion bombardment.

The polysaccharides films were characterized in the air just after their formation and after annealing at temperatures higher than their glass transition temperature or melt temperature. The films thickness close to 2 nm and surface roughness did not vary significantly upon annealing. AFM images revealed the presence of small clumps dispersed on a homogeneous layer, which covered completely the Si wafers. Such topographic details were also observed after annealing. However, upon annealing the films surfaces changed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, evidencing molecular re-orientation at the solid-air interface. The adhesion of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lipase onto the cellulose esters films was quantified in order to evaluate the possibility of applying such films as selective support for biomolecules. © Springer 2005.",Annealing; Atomic force microscopy; Bovine serum albumin; Cellulose esters; Contact angle; Ellipsometry; Lipase; Ultrathin films,Adsorption; Annealing; Atomic force microscopy; Cellulose films; Characterization; Contact angle; Ellipsometry; Film preparation; Glass transition; Silicon wafers; Thermal effects; Ultrathin films; Bovine serum albumin (BSA); Contact angle measurements; Film thickness; Lipase; Melt temperature; Polyesters; Adsorption; Annealing; Cellulose Acetate; Cellulose Butyrate; Cellulose Esters; Cellulose Film; Cellulose Propionate; Contact Angle; Glass Transition Temperature; Interfaces; Microanalysis; Mixed Esters; Molecular Structure; Preparation; Silicon; Thickness; Water Repellence; Wettability; cellulose; film

A characteristic feature of the method is that during the deposition process not only is the substrate coated by the plasma, but the plasma gun itself and the magnetic field coil and/or vacuum vessel section constituting the macroparticle filter are also coated to some extent. If then the plasma gun cathode is changed to a new element, there can be a contamination of the subsequent film deposition by sputtering from various parts of the system of the previous coating species. We have experimentally explored this effect and compared our results with theoretical estimates of sputtering from the stopping and range of ions in matter code.

Enolase is an enzyme of glycolytic pathway that catalyses a reversible conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. In this work the adsorption behavior of enolase (2-phospho-D-glycerayte hydrolyase) onto hydrophilic silicon wafers and amino-terminated surfaces (APS) and onto hydrophobic polymer polystyrene (PS) was studied by means of null-ellipsometry. The adsorption kinetics of enolase onto these substrates presented three distinct regions: (i) a diffusion-controlled one; (ii) an adsorption plateau; (iii) continuous, irreversible, and asymptotic increase of the adsorbed amount with time. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that well-packed entities formed an enolase biofilm, which might correspond to the monolayer formation. With increase of the adsorption time, aggregates appeared on the surface, suggesting multilayer formation. The early stages might be predicted by the random sequential adsorption model (RSA), while the cooperative sequential adsorption (CSA) model seems to describe regions ii and iii. No significant influence of ionic strength was observed on the adsorption behavior of enolase onto the present substrates. The adsorption isotherms show that enolase has no preferential adhesion onto hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates. Contact angle measurements showed that PS surfaces became hydrophilic and silicon surfaces turned hydrophobic after the formation of the enolase biofilm. The study of the influence of pH on the enolase adsorption on silicon and APS surfaces showed that the higher adsorbed amount occurs when pH is close to enolase pI. Far from pi the enzyme solubility decreases and some repulsive forces come out, leading to a decrease in the adsorbed amount.",,Adsorption; Adsorption isotherms; Atomic force microscopy; Contact angle; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Ionic strength; Multilayers; Polystyrenes; Silicon wafers; Solubility; Substrates; Surface chemistry; Solid substrates; Enzymes

Depending on the process parameters, the resulting silicon surface at the bottom of the trench has different roughness levels. In order to study the most important roughness generating parameters and mechanisms, a new parameter was introduced: the normalized roughness, defined as the average roughness divided by the etched depth. Traces of oxygen create a silicon dioxide micromask which generates surface roughness. In a similar way, a non-uniform native oxide can create high roughness levels in the silicon. Hard masks are sputtered and material is redeposited onto the silicon, creating a micromask. For an aluminum mask, the induced normalized roughness is proportional to the DC bias voltage, for a NiCr mask, the normalized roughness level was much higher and there is no clear trend between induced roughness and Dc bias voltage. Accordingly, in order to obtain smooth silicon surfaces after deep trench etching, an aluminum mask has to be used, a process with low (absolute value of the) DC bias voltage and no oxygen traces is required and also the removal of the native oxide from the silicon surface.",,Aluminum; Masks; Micromachining; Oxygen; Plasma etching; Reactive ion etching; Silica; Sulfur compounds; Surface roughness; Deep trench etching; Micromasks; Sulfur hexafluoride; Silicon wafers

The treatment involves Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films deposited on the glass substrates. Textural observations and phase-shift measurements of the transmitted light were carried out. A phenomenological model which allows calculation of the director average orientation in the bulk and at the surfaces is used for interpreting the experimental data. Our results show that the average director alignment depends on the concentration of the magnetic grains of ferrofluid at the glass surfaces. On the contrary, it is practically independent of the nature of the molecule deposited on the glass substrate. According to the model, the flat glass surface, independently of the treatment or the absence of any treatment, stabilizes onto itself a lamellar layer (or bilayer) formed by the amphiphilic molecules of the liquid crystal. This layer screens the effect of the LB film (or of the pure untreated substrate) on the alignment of the lyotropic nematic mesophase. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,
