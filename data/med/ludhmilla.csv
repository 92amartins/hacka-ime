Although its benefits for cardiac function have been well documented, its effects on cerebral circulation are still controversial. We hypothesized that transfer function analysis (TFA) and continuous estimates of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA) provide consistent results in the assessment of cerebral autoregulation in patients with IABP. Approach: Continuous recordings of blood pressure (BP, intra-arterial line), end-tidal CO2, heart rate and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV, transcranial Doppler) were obtained (i) 5 min with IABP ratio 1:3, (ii) 5 min, starting 1 min with the IABP-ON, and continuing for another 4 min without pump assistance (IABP-OFF). Autoregulation index (ARI) was estimated from the CBFV response to a step change in BP derived by TFA and as a function of time using an autoregressive moving-average model during removal of the device (ARIt). Critical closing pressure and resistance area-product were also obtained. Main results: ARI with IABP-ON (4.3 1.2) were not different from corresponding values at IABP-OFF (4.7 1.4, p = 0.42). Removal of the balloon had no effect on ARIt, CBFV, BP, cerebral critical closing pressure or resistance area-product. Significance: IABP does not disturb cerebral hemodynamics. TFA and continuous estimates of dynamic CA can be used to assess cerebral hemodynamics in patients with IABP. These findings have important implications for the design of studies of critically ill patients requiring the use of different invasive support devices. © 2017 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",autoregulation index; cerebral blood flow velocity; dynamic cerebral autoregulation; intra-aortic balloon pump; transcranial doppler ultrasound,

Design: Single center, randomized, double-blind controlled trial. Setting: Teaching hospital. Patients: Adult cancer patients with septic shock in the first 6 hours of ICU admission. Interventions: Patients were randomized to the liberal (hemoglobin threshold, < 9 g/dL) or to the restrictive strategy (hemoglobin threshold, < 7 g/dL) of RBC transfusion during ICU stay. Measurements and Main Results: Patients were randomized to the liberal (n = 149) or to the restrictive transfusion strategy (n = 151) group. Patients in the liberal group received more RBC units than patients in the restrictive group (1 [0-3] vs 0 [0-2] unit; p < 0.001). At 28 days after randomization, mortality rate in the liberal group (primary endpoint of the study) was 45% (67 patients) versus 56% (84 patients) in the restrictive group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.53-1.04; p = 0.08) with no differences in ICU and hospital length of stay. At 90 days after randomization, mortality rate in the liberal group was lower (59% vs 70%) than in the restrictive group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53-0.97; p = 0.03). Conclusions: We observed a survival trend favoring a liberal transfusion strategy in patients with septic shock when compared with the restrictive strategy. These results went in the opposite direction of the a priori hypothesis and of other trials in the field and need to be confirmed. © 2017 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Ludhmila Abrahão Hajjar,Effect of intensive vs moderate alveolar recruitment strategies added to lung-protective ventilation on postoperative pulmonary complications a randomized clinical trial,2017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017505328&doi=10.1001%2fjama.2017.2297&partnerID=40&md5=3e7f7c3d55ae574dd4754ff17cfa118a,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"IMPORTANCE Perioperative lung-protective ventilation has been recommended to reduce pulmonary complications after cardiac surgery. The protective role of a small tidal volume (VT) has been established, whereas the added protection afforded by alveolar recruiting strategies remains controversial. OBJECTIVE To determine whether an intensive alveolar recruitment strategy could reduce postoperative pulmonary complications, when added to a protective ventilation with small VT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial of patients with hypoxemia after cardiac surgery at a single ICU in Brazil (December 2011-2014). INTERVENTIONS Intensive recruitment strategy (n=157) or moderate recruitment strategy (n=163) plus protective ventilation with small VT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Severity of postoperative pulmonary complications computed until hospital discharge, analyzed with a common odds ratio (OR) to detect ordinal shift in distribution of pulmonary complication severity score (0-To-5 scale, 0, no complications; 5, death). Prespecified secondary outcomes were length of stay in the ICU and hospital, incidence of barotrauma, and hospital mortality. RESULTS All 320 patients (median age, 62 years; IQR, 56-69 years; 125 women [39%]) completed the trial. The intensive recruitment strategy group had a mean 1.8 (95%CI, 1.7 to 2.0) and a median 1.7 (IQR, 1.0-2.0) pulmonary complications score vs 2.1 (95%CI, 2.0-2.3) and 2.0 (IQR, 1.5-3.0) for the moderate strategy group. Overall, the distribution of primary outcome scores shifted consistently in favor of the intensive strategy, with a common OR for lower scores of 1.86 (95%CI, 1.22 to 2.83; P = .003). The mean hospital stay for the moderate group was 12.4 days vs 10.9 days in the intensive group (absolute difference, 1.5 days; 95% CI, 3.1 to 0.3; P = .04). The mean ICU stay for the moderate group was 4.8 days vs 3.8 days for the intensive group (absolute difference, 1.0 days; 95%CI, 1.6 to 0.2; P = .01). Hospital mortality (2.5%in the intensive group vs 4.9% in the moderate group; absolute difference, 2.4%, 95%CI, 7.1%to 2.2%) and barotrauma incidence (0% in the intensive group vs 0.6% in the moderate group; absolute difference, 0.6%; 95%CI, 1.8%to 0.6%; P = .51) did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with hypoxemia after cardiac surgery, the use of an intensive vs a moderate alveolar recruitment strategy resulted in less severe pulmonary complications while in the hospital.",,"adult; aged; Article; artificial ventilation; barotrauma; Brazil; continuous ventilator; controlled study; coronary artery bypass graft; disease severity; female; heart valve surgery; hospital mortality; human; hypoxemia; intensive alveolar recruitment strategy; intensive care unit; length of stay; lung disease; lung protective ventilation; major clinical study; male; moderate alveolar recruitment strategy; postoperative complication; randomized controlled trial; therapy effect; tidal volume; adverse effects; artificial ventilation; barotrauma; blood pressure; heart rate; heart surgery; hypoxia; incidence; intensive care; lung alveolus; Lung Diseases; middle aged; odds ratio; oxygen therapy; partial pressure; physiology; positive end expiratory pressure; Postoperative Complications; procedures; severity of illness index; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Barotrauma; Blood Pressure; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Critical Care; Female; Heart Rate; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Hypoxia; Incidence; Length of Stay; Lung Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Partial Pressure; Positive-Pressure Respiration; Postoperative Complications; Pulmonary Alveoli; Respiration, Artificial; Severity of Illness Index; Tidal Volume"

Thus, any nonsurgical interventions that help reduce perioperative mortality might save thousands of lives. The authors have updated a previous consensus process to identify all the nonsurgical interventions, supported by randomized evidence, that may help reduce perioperative mortality. Design and Setting A web-based international consensus conference. Participants The study comprised 500 clinicians from 61 countries. Interventions A systematic literature search was performed to identify published literature about nonsurgical interventions, supported by randomized evidence, showing a statistically significant impact on mortality. A consensus conference of experts discussed eligible papers. The interventions identified by the conference then were submitted to colleagues worldwide through a web-based survey. Measurements and Main Results The authors identified 11 interventions contributing to increased survival (perioperative hemodynamic optimization, neuraxial anesthesia, noninvasive ventilation, tranexamic acid, selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract, insulin for tight glycemic control, preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump, leuko-depleted red blood cells transfusion, levosimendan, volatile agents, and remote ischemic preconditioning) and 2 interventions showing increased mortality (beta-blocker therapy and aprotinin). Interventions then were voted on by participating clinicians. Percentages of agreement among clinicians in different countries differed significantly for 6 interventions, and a variable gap between evidence and clinical practice was noted. Conclusions The authors identified 13 nonsurgical interventions that may decrease or increase perioperative mortality, with variable agreement by clinicians. Such interventions may be optimal candidates for investigation in high-quality trials and discussion in international guidelines to reduce perioperative mortality. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",anesthesia; consensus; intensive care; mortality; perioperative care,

Methods We randomized 648 statin-naïve patients who were scheduled for noncardiac surgery and were at risk for a major vascular complication. Patients were randomized to a loading dose of atorvastatin or placebo (80 mg anytime within 18 hours before surgery), followed by a maintenance dose of 40 mg (or placebo), started at least 12 hours after the surgery, and then 40 mg/d (or placebo) for 7 days. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, and stroke at 30 days. Results The primary outcome was observed in 54 (16.6%) of 326 patients in the atorvastatin group and 59 (18.7%) of 316 patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.60-1.26, P = .46). No significant effect was observed on the 30-day secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality (4.3% vs 4.1%, respectively; HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.53-2.47, P = .74), nonfatal myocardial infarction (3.4% vs 4.4%, respectively; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.35-1.68, P = .50), myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (13.2% vs 16.5%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.53-1.19, P = .26), and stroke (0.9% vs 0%, P = .25). Conclusion In contrast to the prior observational and trial data, the LOAD trial has neutral results and did not demonstrate a reduction in major cardiovascular complications after a short-term perioperative course of statin in statin-naïve patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. We demonstrated, however, that a large multicenter blinded perioperative statin trial for high-risk statin-naïve patients is feasible and should be done to definitely establish the efficacy and safety of statin in this patient population. © 2016",,"acetylsalicylic acid; atorvastatin; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium antagonist; clonidine; clopidogrel; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; fibric acid derivative; insulin; low molecular weight heparin; nitric acid derivative; placebo; warfarin; atorvastatin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; troponin; aged; Article; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; heart muscle injury; high risk population; human; loading drug dose; major clinical study; major surgery; male; mortality; multicenter study; outcome assessment; postoperative complication; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; blood; clinical trial; electrocardiography; middle aged; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Ischemia; perioperative period; Postoperative Complications; procedures; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; Stroke; surgery; Aged; Atorvastatin Calcium; Electrocardiography; Female; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Ischemia; Perioperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Assessment; Stroke; Surgical Procedures, Operative; Troponin"

Many surgeons and clinicians believe that VTE after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has little clinical significance because it is seldom diagnosed. This study aimed to identify VTE after CABG, independent of clinical suspicion. In this prospective, observational, single-center study, 100 patients underwent computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (multidetector-64) and lower extremity venous compressive ultrasound after elective CABG. Patients with high risk for VTE were excluded. Aspirin was maintained throughout the preoperative and postoperative periods, and early ambulation was encouraged. Postoperatively, no mechanical or heparin prophylaxis was used in any patients. At the discretion of the surgeons, 83 surgeries were on-pump, and 17 were off-pump. On average, tomography and ultrasound were performed 7 ± 3 days after CABG. Isolated PE was observed in 13 of 100 patients (13%), simultaneous PE and DVT in 8 of 100 (8%), and isolated DVT in 4 of 100 (4%), thus totaling 25/100 VTEs (25%). Of the 21 PEs, 3 of 21 (14%) involved subsegmental, 15 of 21 (71%) segmental, 1 of 21 (5%) lobar, and 2 of 21 (10%) central pulmonary arteries. Of the 12 DVTs, all were distal (below the popliteal vein), and 2 of 12 (17%) were also proximal; 5 of 12 (42%) were unilateral, of which 3 of 5 (60%) on the contralateral saphenous vein-harvested leg. No VTE caused hemodynamic instability, and none was clinically suspected. In conclusion, VTEs were frequent, some extensive proximal VTEs occurred, but most were distally localized. Many patients in this series would have been discharged without diagnosis of and treatment for PE and/or DVT. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,acetylsalicylic acid; adult; aged; Article; body mass; cardiac patient; cardiopulmonary bypass; cardiovascular risk; computed tomographic angiography; computed tomography scanner; coronary artery bypass graft; deep vein thrombosis; female; hospitalization; human; intensive care unit; lung angiography; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; multidetector computed tomography; observational study; off pump coronary surgery; postoperative complication; postoperative period; preoperative period; priority journal; prospective study; surgical patient; thrombosis prevention; adverse effects; coronary artery bypass graft; coronary artery disease; diagnostic imaging; echography; middle aged; Pulmonary Embolism; Venous Thrombosis; Aged; Computed Tomography Angiography; Coronary Artery Bypass; Coronary Artery Disease; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Embolism; Ultrasonography; Venous Thrombosis

We hypothesized that iHF patients have a higher incidence of impaired dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA). Adult patients with iHF and healthy volunteers were included. Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV, transcranial Doppler, middle cerebral artery), end-tidal CO2 (capnography), and arterial blood pressure (Finometer) were continuously recorded supine for 5 min at rest. Autoregulation index (ARI) was estimated from the CBFV step response derived by transfer function analysis using standard template curves. Fifty-two iHF patients and 54 age-, gender-, and BP-matched healthy volunteers were studied. Echocardiogram ejection fraction was 40 (20–45) % in iHF group. iHF patients compared with control subjects had reduced end-tidal CO2 (34.1 ± 3.7 vs. 38.3 ± 4.0 mmHg, P ± 0.001) and lower ARI values (5.1 ± 1.6 vs. 5.9 ± 1.0, P ± 0.012). ARI &lt; 4, suggestive of impaired CA, was more common in iHF patients (28.8 vs. 7.4%, P ± 0.004). These results confirm that iHF patients are more likely to have impaired dCA compared with age-matched controls. The relationship between impaired dCA and neurological complications in iHF patients deserves further investigation. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.",Autoregulation index; Cerebral blood flow; Dynamic cerebral autoregulation; Transcranial Doppler; Transfer function analysis,adult; arterial pressure; Article; autoregulation; blood flow velocity; brain blood flow; capnometry; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; female; heart ejection fraction; heart failure; human; ischemic heart disease; ischemic heart failure; major clinical study; male; middle aged; middle cerebral artery; priority journal; transcranial Doppler ultrasonography; brain circulation; Cerebrovascular Disorders; complication; heart failure; heart muscle ischemia; homeostasis; pathophysiology; Blood Flow Velocity; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Female; Heart Failure; Homeostasis; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Ischemia

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether vasopressin is superior to norepinephrine in reducing postoperative complications in patients with vasoplegic syndrome. Methods: This prospective, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted at the Heart Institute, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, between January 2012 and March 2014. Patients with vasoplegic shock (defined as mean arterial pressure less than 65 mmHg resistant to fluid challenge and cardiac index greater than 2.2 l · min -2 · m -2) after cardiac surgery were randomized to receive vasopressin (0.01 to 0.06 U/min) or norepinephrine (10 to 60 μg/min) to maintain arterial pressure. The primary endpoint was a composite of mortality or severe complications (stroke, requirement for mechanical ventilation for longer than 48 h, deep sternal wound infection, reoperation, or acute renal failure) within 30 days. Results: A total of 330 patients were randomized, and 300 were infused with one of the study drugs (vasopressin, 149; norepinephrine, 151). The primary outcome occurred in 32% of the vasopressin patients and in 49% of the norepinephrine patients (unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.80; P = 0.0014). Regarding adverse events, the authors found a lower occurrence of atrial fibrillation in the vasopressin group (63.8% vs. 82.1%; P = 0.0004) and no difference between groups in the rates of digital ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, hyponatremia, and myocardial infarction. Conclusions: The authors' results suggest that vasopressin can be used as a first-line vasopressor agent in postcardiac surgery vasoplegic shock and improves clinical outcomes. © 2016 the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.

Methods: Retrospective, unicentric, observational study. Objective: To analyze the long-term outcomes in patients undergoing treatment of the culprit artery, comparing those who remained with significant residual lesions in nonculprit arteries (group I) versus those without residual lesions in other coronary artery beds (group II). The study included 580 patients (284 in group I and 296 in group II) between May 2010 and May 2013. We obtained demographic and clinical data, as well as information regarding the coronary treatment administered to the patients. In the statistical analysis, the primary outcome included combined events (reinfarction/ angina, death, heart failure, and need for reintervention). The comparison between groups was performed using the chisquare test and ANOVA. The long-term analysis was conducted with the Kaplan-Meier method, with a mean follow-up of 9.86 months. Results: The mean ages were 63 years in group I and 62 years in group II. On long-term follow-up, there was no significant difference in combined events in groups I and II (31.9% versus 35.6%, respectively, p = 0.76). Conclusion: The strategy of treating the culprit artery alone seems safe. In this study, no long-term differences in combined endpoints were observed between patients who remained with significant lesions compared with those without other obstructions. © 2016, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

The authors applied democracy-based medicine to key trials in critical care medicine. Design and Setting A systematic review of literature followed by web-based voting on findings of a consensus conference. Participants A total of 555 clinicians from 61 countries. Interventions The authors performed a systematic literature review (via searching MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Embase) and selected all multicenter randomized clinical trials in critical care that reported a significant effect on survival and were endorsed by expert clinicians. Then they solicited voting and self-reported practice on such evidence via an interactive Internet questionnaire. Relationships among trial sample size, design, and respondents’ agreement were investigated. The gap between agreement and use/avoidance and the influence of country origin on physicians’ approach to interventions also were investigated. Measurements and Main Results According to 24 multicenter randomized controlled trials, 15 interventions affecting mortality were identified. Wide variabilities in both the level of agreement and reported practice among different interventions and countries were found. Moreover, agreement and reported practice often did not coincide. Finally, a positive correlation among agreement, trial sample size, and number of included centers was found. On the contrary, trial design did not influence clinicians’ agreement.

Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: Two cancer specialized ICUs in Brazil. Patients: A total of 792 participants. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The health-related quality of life before ICU admission; at 15 days; and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months was assessed with the EQ-5D-3L. In addition, the vital status was assessed at 24 months. The mean age of the subjects was 61.6 ± 14.3 years, 42.5% were female subjects and half were admitted after elective surgery. The mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 was 47.4 ± 15.6. Survival at 12 and 18 months was 42.4% and 38.1%, respectively. The mean EQ-5D-3L utility measure before admission to the ICU was 0.47 ± 0.43, at 15 days it was 0.41 ± 0.44, at 90 days 0.56 ± 0.42, at 6 months 0.60 ± 0.41, at 12 months 0.67 ± 0.35, and at 18 months 0.67 ± 0.35. The probabilities for attaining 12 and 18 months of quality-adjusted survival were 30.1% and 19.1%, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in survival time and quality-adjusted life years according to all assessed baseline characteristics (ICU admission after elective surgery, emergency surgery, or medical admission; Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3; cancer extension; cancer status; previous surgery; previous chemotherapy; previous radiotherapy; performance status; and previous health-related quality of life). Only the previous health-related quality of life and performance status were associated with the health-related quality of life during the 18-month follow-up. Conclusions: Long-term survival, health-related quality of life, and quality-adjusted life year expectancy of cancer patients admitted to the ICU are limited. Nevertheless, these clinical outcomes exhibit wide variability among patients and are associated with simple characteristics present at the time of ICU admission, which may help healthcare professionals estimate patients' prognoses. © 2016 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",cancer; cohort study; critically ill patients; health-related quality of life; intensive care unit; quality-adjusted life year,antineoplastic agent; adult; advanced cancer; Article; brain cancer; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; cancer survival; central nervous system tumor; cohort analysis; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; critically ill patient; digestive system cancer; elective surgery; emergency surgery; female; genital tract cancer; hospital admission; human; length of stay; leukemia; long term survival; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplastic disease; metastasis; mouth cancer; multicenter study; myeloma; patient history of chemotherapy; patient history of radiotherapy; patient history of tumorectomy; pharynx cancer; primary tumor; priority journal; prospective study; quality adjusted life year; respiratory tract cancer; Simplified Acute Physiology Score; surgical patient; survival time; urinary tract cancer; aged; Brazil; critical illness; epidemiology; health status; intensive care unit; middle aged; mortality; neoplasm; quality of life; survival analysis; Aged; Brazil; Critical Illness; Female; Health Status; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Patient Admission; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Survival Analysis

It was a retrospective study including all patients diagnosed with XDR-ABC bacteraemia during hospitalization in the intensive care unit of a cancer hospital between July 2009 and July 2013. Surveillance cultures were collected weekly during the study period, and clonality was analysed using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We analysed underlying diseases, oncology therapy, neutrophil counts, infection site and management of infection, in terms of their correlation with 30-day mortality. During the study period, 92 patients with XDR-ABC bacteraemia were identified, of whom 35 (38.0%) were patients with haematological malignancy. We identified XDR-ABC strains with four different profile patterns, 91.3% of patients harbouring the predominant PFGE type. Of the 92 patients with XDR-ABC bacteraemia, 66 (71.7%) had central line-associated bloodstream infections; infection occurred during neutropenia in 22 (23.9%); and 58 (63.0%) died before receiving the appropriate therapy. All patients were treated with polymyxin, which was used in combination therapy in 30 of them (32.4%). The 30-day mortality rate was 83.7%. Multivariate analysis revealed that septic shock at diagnosis of XDR-ABC infection was a risk factor for 30-day mortality; protective factors were receiving appropriate therapy and invasive device removal within the first 48 h. Among cancer patients, ineffective management of such infection increases the risk of death, more so than do features such as neutropenia and infection at the tumour site. © 2015 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.",Acinetobacter baumannii; Bacterial infection; Bloodstream infection; Cancer; Carbapenem resistance; Intensive care; Mortality; Multidrug resistance; Neutropenia; Tumour infection,"amikacin; aminoglycoside; colistin; gentamicin; imipenem; meropenem; polymyxin; sultamicillin; tigecycline; antiinfective agent; Acinetobacter baumannii; Acinetobacter infection; acute leukemia; adult; aged; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacteremia; bloodstream infection; cancer center; cancer mortality; cancer patient; catheter infection; female; Hodgkin disease; hospitalization; human; intensive care unit; major clinical study; male; mortality; mortality rate; multiple myeloma; neutropenia; neutrophil count; nonhodgkin lymphoma; priority journal; retrospective study; septic shock; solid tumor; Acinetobacter baumannii; Acinetobacter Infections; adolescent; complication; drug effects; isolation and purification; microbiology; middle aged; multidrug resistance; neoplasm; risk factor; sepsis; survival analysis; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Acinetobacter baumannii; Acinetobacter Infections; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Neutropenia; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sepsis; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"

Design: A prospective randomized controlled trial and an updated metaanalysis of randomized trials published from inception up to May 1, 2015. Setting: Surgical ICU within a tertiary referral university-affiliated teaching hospital. Patients: One hundred twenty-six high-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery or valve repair. Interventions: Patients were randomized to a cardiac output-guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm (goal-directed therapy group, n = 62) or to usual care (n = 64). In the goal-directed therapy arm, a cardiac index of greater than 3 L/min/m2 was targeted with IV fluids, inotropes, and RBC transfusion starting from cardiopulmonary bypass and ending 8 hours after arrival to the ICU. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of 30-day mortality and major postoperative complications. Patients from the goal-directed therapy group received a greater median (interquartile range) volume of IV fluids than the usual care group (1,000 [625-1,500] vs 500 [500-1,000] mL; p &lt; 0.001], with no differences in the administration of either inotropes or RBC transfusions. The primary outcome was reduced in the goal-directed therapy group (27.4% vs 45.3%; p = 0.037). The goal-directed therapy group had a lower occurrence rate of infection (12.9% vs 29.7%; p = 0.002) and low cardiac output syndrome (6.5% vs 26.6%; p = 0.002). We also observed lower ICU cumulative dosage of dobutamine (12 vs 19 mg/kg; p = 0.003) and a shorter ICU (3 [3-4] vs 5 [4-7] d; p &lt; 0.001) and hospital length of stay (9 [8-16] vs 12 [9-22] d; p = 0.049) in the goal-directed therapy compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in 30-day mortality rates (4.8% vs 9.4%, respectively; p = 0.492). The metaanalysis identified six trials and showed that, when compared with standard treatment, goal-directed therapy reduced the overall rate of complications (goal-directed therapy, 47/410 [11%] vs usual care, 92/415 [22%]; odds ratio, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.26-0.63]; p &lt; 0.0001) and decreased the hospital length of stay (mean difference,-5.44 d; 95% CI,-9.28 to-1.60; p = 0.006) with no difference in postoperative mortality: 9 of 410 (2.2%) versus 15 of 415 (3.6%), odds ratio, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.26-1.47), and p = 0.27.

The aim of this study was to assess the safety and the adequacy of intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) in critically ill cancer patients with AKI. Methods and Findings In this observational prospective cohort study, 149 ICU cancer patients with AKI were treated with 448 single-pass batch IHD procedures and evaluated from June 2010 to June 2012. Primary outcomes were IHD complications (hypotension and clotting) and adequacy. A multiple logistic regression was performed in order to identify factors associated with IHD complications (hypotension and clotting). Patients were 62.2 ± 14.3 years old, 86.6% had a solid cancer, sepsis was the main AKI cause (51%) and in-hospital mortality was 59.7%. RRT session time was 240 (180-300) min, blood/dialysate flow was 250 (200-300) mL/min and UF was 1000 (0-2000) ml. Hypotension occurred in 25% of the sessions. Independent risk factors (RF) for hypotension were dialysate conductivity (each ms/cm, OR 0.81, CI 0.69-0.95), initial mean arterial pressure (each 10 mmHg, OR 0.49, CI 0.40-0.61) and SOFA score (OR 1.16, CI 1.03-1.30). Clotting and malfunctioning catheters (MC) occurred in 23.8% and 29.2% of the procedures, respectively. Independent RF for clotting were heparin use (OR 0.57, CI 0.33-0.99), MC (OR 3.59, CI 2.24-5.77) and RRT system pressure increase over 25% (OR 2.15, CI 1.61-4.17). Post RRT blood tests were urea 71 (49-104) mg/dL, creatinine 2.71 (2.10-3.8) mg/dL, bicarbonate 24.1 (22.5-25.5) mEq/Land K3.8 (3.5-4.1) mEq/L Conclusion IHD for critically ill patients with cancer and AKI offered acceptable hemodynamic stability and provided adequate metabolic control. © 2016 Torres da Costa e Silva et al.

Methods This is a substudy of the Transfusion Requirements After Cardiac Surgery (TRACS) randomized controlled trial. In this subgroup analysis, we separated patients into those aged 60 years or more (elderly) and those aged less than 60 years randomized to a restrictive or a liberal strategy of red blood cell transfusion. The primary outcome was a composite defined as a combination of 30-day all-cause mortality and severe morbidity. Results Of the 502 patients included in the Transfusion Requirements After Cardiac Surgery study, 260 (51.8%) were aged 60 years or more and 242 (48.2%) were aged less than 60 years and were included in this study. The primary end point occurred in 11.9% of patients in the liberal strategy group and 16.8% of patients in the restrictive strategy group (P =.254) for those aged 60 years or more and in 6.8% of patients in the liberal strategy group and 5.6% of patients in the restrictive strategy group for those aged less than 60 years (P =.714). However, in the older patients, cardiogenic shock was more frequent in patients in the restrictive transfusion group (12.8% vs 5.2%, P =.031). Thirty-day mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute renal injury were similar in the restrictive and liberal transfusion groups in both age groups. Conclusions Although there was no difference between groups regarding the primary outcome, a restrictive transfusion strategy may result in an increased rate of cardiogenic shock in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery compared with a more liberal strategy.

If an adequate mean arterial pressure is not promptly restored, insufficient tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction may develop. Fluids and catecholamines are the cornerstone of critical hypotensive states management. Catecholamines side effects such as increased myocardial oxygen consumption and development of arrhythmias are well known. Thus, in recent years, interest in catecholamine-sparing agents such as vasopressin, terlipressin and methylene blue has increased; however, few randomized trials, mostly with small sample sizes, have been performed. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials to investigate the effect of non-catecholaminergic vasopressors on mortality. Methods: PubMed, BioMed Central and Embase were searched (update December 31st, 2014) by two independent investigators. Inclusion criteria were: random allocation to treatment, at least one group receiving a non-catecholaminergic vasopressor, patients with or at risk for vasodilatory shock. Exclusion criteria were: crossover studies, pediatric population, nonhuman studies, studies published as abstract only, lack of data on mortality. Studied drugs were vasopressin, terlipressin and methylene blue. Primary endpoint was mortality at the longest follow-up available. Results: A total of 1,608 patients from 20 studies were included in our analysis. The studied settings were sepsis (10/20 studies [50%]), cardiac surgery (7/20 [35%]), vasodilatory shock due to any cause (2/20 [19%]), and acute traumatic injury (1/20 [5%]). Overall, pooled estimates showed that treatment with non-catecholaminergic agents improves survival (278/810 [34.3%] versus 309/798 [38.7%], risk ratio = 0.88, 95%confidence interval = 0.79 to 0.98, p = 0.02). None of the drugs was associated with significant reduction inmortality when analyzed independently. Results were not confirmed when analyzing studies with a low risk of bias. Conclusions: Catecholamine-sparing agents in patients with or at risk for vasodilatory shock may improve survival. Further researches on this topic are needed to confirm the finding. © 2015 Belletti et al.

A meta-analysis of randomised trials,2015,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943260109&doi=10.1093%2fbja%2faev317&partnerID=40&md5=88f4b5b82081be00289525f9c9eeff98,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Background Guidelines support the use of a restrictive strategy in blood transfusion management in a variety of clinical settings. However, recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed in the perioperative setting suggest a beneficial effect on survival of a liberal strategy. We aimed to assess the effect of liberal and restrictive blood transfusion strategies on mortality in perioperative and critically ill adult patients through a meta-analysis of RCTs. Methods We searched PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Transfusion Evidence Library, and Google Scholar up to 27 March 2015, for RCTs performed in perioperative or critically ill adult patients, receiving a restrictive or liberal transfusion strategy, and reporting all-cause mortality. We used a fixed or random-effects model to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for pooled data. We assessed heterogeneity using Cochrane's Q and I2 tests. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 90-day follow-up. Results Patients in the perioperative period receiving a liberal transfusion strategy had lower all-cause mortality when compared with patients allocated to receive a restrictive transfusion strategy (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.66 1.00; P=0.05; I2=25%; Number needed to treat=97) with 7552 patients randomized in 17 trials. There was no difference in mortality among critically ill patients receiving a liberal transfusion strategy when compared with the restrictive transfusion strategy (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.991.23; P=0.07; I2=34%) with 3469 patients randomized in 10 trials. Conclusion According to randomized published evidence, perioperative adult patients have an improved survival when receiving a liberal blood transfusion strategy. © 2015 The Author 2015.",anesthesia; blood transfusion; critical illness; mortality; perioperative care,hemoglobin; Article; blood transfusion; cause of death; critically ill patient; hematocrit; hemoglobin blood level; human; liberal blood transfusion; meta analysis; perioperative period; postoperative period; priority journal; prognosis; randomized controlled trial (topic); restrictive blood transfusion; surgical mortality; surgical patient; survival; systematic review; blood transfusion; critical illness; intensive care; mortality; perioperative period; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); statistics and numerical data; survival; treatment outcome; Blood Transfusion; Critical Care; Critical Illness; Humans; Perioperative Care; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome

Red blood cell transfusion is the most commonly prescribed therapy for anemia. Despite being life-saving, it carries a risk that ranges from mild complications to death. The aim of this review is to discuss the risks of anemia and blood transfusion, and to describe recent developments in the strategies to reduce allogeneic blood transfusion. Recent Findings: In the past decades, clinical studies comparing transfusion strategies in different populations were conducted. Despite the challenges imposed by the development of such studies, evidence-based medicine on transfusion medicine in critically ill patients is being created. Different results arising from these studies reflect population heterogeneity, specific circumstances, and difficulties in measuring the impact of anemia and transfusion in a clinical trial. Summary: An adequate judgment of a clinical condition associated with proper application of the available literature is the cornerstone in the management of transfusion in critical care. Apart from this individualized strategy, the institution of a patient blood management program allows goal-directed approach through preoperative recognition of anemia, surgical efforts to minimize blood loss, and continuous assessment of the coagulation status. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Methods: In a randomized, controlled, parallel-group, double-blind (patients and outcome assessors) superiority trial in the intensive care unit of a tertiary oncology hospital, the authors evaluated whether a restrictive strategy of erythrocyte transfusion (transfusion when hemoglobin concentration <7 g/dl) was superior to a liberal one (transfusion when hemoglobin concentration <9 g/dl) for reducing mortality and severe clinical complications among patients having major cancer surgery. All adult patients with cancer having major abdominal surgery who required postoperative intensive care were included and randomly allocated to treatment with the liberal or the restrictive erythrocyte transfusion strategy. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of mortality and morbidity. Results: A total of 198 patients were included as follows: 101 in the restrictive group and 97 in the liberal group. The primary composite endpoint occurred in 19.6% (95% CI, 12.9 to 28.6%) of patients in the liberal-strategy group and in 35.6% (27.0 to 45.4%) of patients in the restrictive-strategy group (P = 0.012). Compared with the restrictive strategy, the liberal transfusion strategy was associated with an absolute risk reduction for the composite outcome of 16% (3.8 to 28.2%) and a number needed to treat of 6.2 (3.5 to 26.5). Conclusion: A liberal erythrocyte transfusion strategy with a hemoglobin trigger of 9 g/dl was associated with fewer major postoperative complications in patients having major cancer surgery compared with a restrictive strategy.

The median 48-hour blood loss was not significantly different between the 2 groups (320 mL [interquartile range, 157-750] vs 410 mL [interquartile range, 215-510], respectively; P = .672). After treatment, plasma fibrinogen concentration increased similarly following administration of both products. There were no differences in allogeneic blood transfusion after intervention treatment.Conclusions: A large trial comparing fibrinogen concentrate and cryoprecipitate in the management of children with acute acquired hypofibrinogenemia during heart surgery is feasible. The preliminary results of our study showed that the use of fibrinogen concentrate was as efficient and safe as cryoprecipitate in the management of bleeding children undergoing cardiac surgery.Objectives: Acute acquired hypofibrinogenemia in children undergoing cardiac surgery is a major concern because it often results in perioperative bleeding and high rates of allogeneic blood transfusion. Fibrinogen concentrate has been proposed as an alternative to cryoprecipitate (the gold standard therapy), with minimal infectious and immunologic risks. Our objective was to investigate the efficacy and safety of fibrinogen concentrate in children undergoing cardiac surgery.Methods: In this randomized pilot study, patients were allocated to receive fibrinogen concentrate (60 mg/kg) or cryoprecipitate (10 mL/kg) if bleeding was associated with fibrinogen levels < 1 g/dL after cardiopulmonary bypass weaning. The primary outcome was postoperative blood losses during the 48 hours after surgery. © 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.",,"blood clotting factor 10; blood clotting factor 13; blood clotting factor 7; blood clotting factor 9; fibrinogen; fibrinogen concentrate; prothrombin; blood clotting factor 8; cryoprecipitate coagulum; fibrinogen; acute heart infarction; acute kidney failure; adult; anaphylaxis; artery thrombosis; Article; artificial ventilation; bleeding; blood clotting test; blood transfusion; cardiopulmonary bypass; cause of death; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; cryoprecipitate; deep vein thrombosis; drug effect; drug eruption; drug fever; drug hypersensitivity; drug induced headache; drug safety; dyspnea; feasibility study; female; fibrinogen blood level; follow up; heart infarction; heart surgery; human; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; patient safety; pediatric surgery; peripheral occlusive artery disease; pilot study; postoperative hemorrhage; postoperative period; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; reoperation; septic shock; thromboembolism; vomiting; Brazil; child; erythrocyte transfusion; infant; operative blood loss; preschool child; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; Blood Coagulation Tests; Blood Loss, Surgical; Brazil; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Cardiopulmonary Bypass; Child; Child, Preschool; Erythrocyte Transfusion; Factor VIII; Female; Fibrinogen; Humans; Infant; Male; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome"

Methods We assessed the renoprotective effect of the highest dose of N-acetylcystein sanctioned for clinical use in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study including 70 chronic kidney disease patients, stage 3 or 4, who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery, on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and off CPB, and were randomly allocated to receive either N-acetylcystein 150 mg/kg followed by 50 mg/kg for 6 hours in 0.9% saline or only 0.9% saline. Acute kidney injury was defined by the Acute Kidney Injury Network classification. Results The incidence of kidney injury was reduced in the N-acetylcystein group (57.1% versus 28.6%, p = 0.016). Nonuse of N-acetylcystein (relative risk 3.58, 95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 12.33, p = 0.04) and cardiopulmonary bypass (relative risk 4.55, 95% confidence interval: 1.28 to 16.15, p = 0.02) were independent predictors of kidney injury. In patients treated with CPB, N-acetylcystein reduced the incidence of kidney injury from 63% to 46%. Oxidative stress was increased in control subjects (p = 0.01) and abolished in patients receiving N-acetylcystein. Conclusions Maximum intravenous doses of N-acetylcystein reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury in patients with kidney disease undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery, abolish oxidative stress, and mitigate the negative effect of CPB on renal function. © 2014 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",,"acetylcysteine; angiotensin receptor antagonist; anticoagulant agent; antidiabetic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; digitalis; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; fibric acid derivative; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; placebo; sodium chloride; vasoactive agent; vasodilator agent; acute heart infarction; acute kidney failure; adult; aged; anticoagulant therapy; article; blood transfusion; cardiopulmonary bypass; cardiovascular disease; chronic kidney disease; clinical assessment; controlled study; coronary artery bypass graft; diabetes mellitus; disease classification; disease severity; diuretic therapy; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug megadose; dyslipidemia; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart muscle revascularization; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; middle aged; oxidative stress; postoperative hemorrhage; predictor variable; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; risk reduction; surgical patient; surgical risk; treatment outcome; Acetylcysteine; Acute Kidney Injury; Aged; Cardiopulmonary Bypass; Confidence Intervals; Coronary Artery Bypass; Coronary Stenosis; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Pulse Therapy, Drug; Reference Values; Risk Assessment; Statistics, Nonparametric; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome"

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether high lactate levels after cardiac surgery are predictors of major complications including mortality. Patients and Methods: This was a substudy of TRACS (Transfusion Requirements After Cardiac Surgery), which was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled trial evaluating the effects of a transfusion strategy on morbidity and mortality. Results: Of the 502 patients enrolled, 52 (10%) had at least 1 major complication. Patients with complications were older, had a higher EuroSCORE, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, lower preoperative hemoglobin, a higher prevalence of renal disease, and received more blood transfusions than the group without complications. Lactate levels were higher in the group with complications at the end of surgery (3.6 mmol/L [2.8-5.1] vs 3.3 mmol/L [2.2-4.8]; P =.018), immediately after intensive care unit (ICU) admission (0 hour) (4.4 mmol/L [3.1-8.4] vs 4 mmol/L [2.6-6.4]; P =.048); 6 hours (4 mmol/L [2.7-5.8] vs 2.6 mmol/L [2-3.6], P <.001), and 12 hours after admission (2.3 mmol/L [1.8-3.2] vs 1.7 mmol/L [1.3-2]; P <.001). In a multivariate model, higher age (odds ratio [OR], 1.048, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.011-1.086; P =.010), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) lower than 40% (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.200-7.510; P =.019 compared with LVEF of 40%-59%; OR, 3.571; 95% CI, 1.503-8.196; P =.004 compared with LVEF higher than 60%), higher EuroSCORE (OR, 1.138; 95% CI; 1.007-1.285; P =.038), red blood cell transfusion (OR, 1.230; 95% CI, 1.086-1.393; P =.001), and lactate levels 6 hours after ICU admission (OR, 3.28, 95% CI; 1.61-6.69; P =.001) are predictors of major complications.

Hospital length of stay (LOS) may be a surrogate of poor outcome in transfused patients.Methods: Data from 502 patients included in Transfusion Requirements After Cardiac Surgery (TRACS) study were analyzed to assess the relationship between RBC transfusion and hospital LOS in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and enrolled in the TRACS study.Results: According to the status of RBC transfusion, patients were categorized into the following three groups: 1) 199 patients (40%) who did not receive RBC, 2) 241 patients (48%) who received 3 RBC units or fewer (low transfusion requirement group), and 3) 62 patients (12%) who received more than 3 RBC units (high transfusion requirement group). In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, the following factors were predictive of a prolonged hospital length of stay: age higher than 65 years, EuroSCORE, valvular surgery, combined procedure, LVEF lower than 40% and RBC transfusion of > 3 units.Conclusion: RBC transfusion is an independent risk factor for increased LOS in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

The aim of this study was to assess the value of coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) and real-time myocardial perfusion echocardiography (RTMPE) for predicting events in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Methods: One hundred ninety-five patients (mean age 54 ± 12 years; 66% men) with dilated cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 35% and no obstructive coronary disease on invasive angiography or multidetector computed tomography) who underwent dipyridamole stress (0.84 mg/kg over 10 min) RTMPE were prospectively studied. CFVR was calculated as the ratio of hyperemic to baseline peak diastolic velocities in the distal left anterior coronary artery. The replenishment velocity (β), plateau of acoustic intensity (AN), and myocardial blood flow reserve were obtained from RTMPE. Results: Mean CFVR was 2.07 ± 0.52, mean A N reserve was 1.05 ± 0.09, mean β reserve was 2.05 ± 0.39, and mean myocardial blood flow reserve (AN × β) was 2.15 ± 0.48. During a median follow-up period of 29 months, 45 patients had events (43 deaths and two urgent transplantations). Independent predictors of events were left atrial diameter (relative risk, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.26; P &lt;.001) and β reserve ≤ 2.0 (relative risk, 3.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-8.79; P &lt;.001). After adjustment for β reserve, CFVR and myocardial blood flow reserve no longer had predictive value. Left atrial diameter added prognostic value over clinical factors and left ventricular ejection fraction (χ2 = 36.8-58.5, P &lt;.001). Beta reserve added additional power to the model (χ2 = 70.2, P &lt;.001). Conclusions: Increased left atrial diameter and depressed β reserve were independent predictors of cardiac death and transplantation in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Beta reserve by RTMPE provided incremental predictive value beyond that provided by current known prognostic clinical and echocardiographic factors.Copyright 2013 by the American Society of Echocardiography.",Contrast echocardiography; Dilated cardiomyopathy; Myocardial blood flow reserve; Myocardial perfusion; Prognostic value,"adult; article; computer assisted tomography; congestive cardiomyopathy; contrast echocardiography; controlled study; coronary flow reserve; diastolic blood pressure; Doppler echocardiography; echocardiography; event free survival; female; follow up; heart death; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart muscle perfusion; heart transplantation; human; major clinical study; male; mitral valve regurgitation; myocardial perfusion imaging; predictive value; prognosis; real time myocardial perfusion echocardiography; sound intensity; systolic blood pressure; Analysis of Variance; Blood Flow Velocity; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated; Chi-Square Distribution; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Circulation; Exercise Test; Female; Heart Transplantation; Humans; Male; Microcirculation; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

Case report: A 53 year old man with oropharynx carcinoma was admitted to ICU for severe pneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was recognized as a difficult-to-intubate patient and an endotracheal tube (ETT) was inserted through a bronchoscope. After one week of treatment, it was observed an endotracheal cuff perforation. Exchanging the endotracheal tube was necessary to achieve satisfactory pulmonary ventilation. An AEC Cook 14 was used to perform the reintubation. After reintubation, the patient presented a worsening in oxygen saturation and a chest radiography (CXR) revealed a large pneumothorax. A chest tube was inserted and we observed immediate improvement in oxygen saturation. A repeat CXR confirmed correct positioning of the chest tube and reexpansion of the right lung. A bronchoscopy performed showed a posterior laceration in the right main bronchus. The patient was extubated the following day. After four days, the chest tube was removed. A CXR performed a day after chest tube removal revealed a small right upper pneumothorax, but the patient remained asymptomatic. Conclusions: Airway exchange catheter is a valuable tool to handle with difficult-to-intubate patients.

Relato de caso: Paciente do sexo masculino, 53 anos, com carcinoma de orofaringe, foi internado na UTI com pneumonia grave e síndrome da angústia respiratória aguda (SARA). O paciente foi identificado como sendo de difícil intubação e uma sonda endotraqueal (SET) foi inserida através de um broncoscópio. Após uma semana de tratamento, observou-se ruptura do manguito endotraqueal. A troca da sonda endotraqueal foi necessária para obter uma ventilação pulmonar satisfatória. Um cateter para troca da via aérea (Cook, tamanho 14) foi usado para realizar a reintubação. Depois da reintubação, o paciente apresentou piora na saturação de oxigênio e uma radiografia revelou um grande pneumotórax. Um dreno torácico foi inserido e uma melhora imediata na saturação de oxigênio foi observada. A repetição da radiografia confirmou o posicionamento correto do dreno torácico e a reexpansão do pulmão direito. A broncoscopia realizada mostrou uma laceração posterior do brônquio principal direito. O paciente foi extubado no dia seguinte. Depois de quatro dias, o dreno torácico foi removido. A radiografia realizada um dia depois da retirada do dreno revelou um pequeno pneumotórax no lobo superior direito, mas o paciente permaneceu assintomático. Conclusões: O cateter para troca da via aérea é uma ferramenta valiosa para lidar com pacientes difíceis de intubar. Embora os médicos geralmente concentrem sua atenção em evitar um barotrauma causado pelo suplemento de oxigênio ou ventilação a jato através do CTVA, a preocupação com a técnica de inserção pode minimizar as complicações que ameaçam a vida e aumentar a segurança do CTVA. © 2013 Elsevier Editora Ltda..","Airway Management; Intensive Care, Anesthesia; Intubation, Intratracheal","adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; airway exchange catheter; article; artificial ventilation; bronchoscopy; bronchus injury; case report; catheter; endotracheal intubation; human; male; oropharynx carcinoma; oxygen saturation; pneumonia; pneumothorax; respiratory failure; thorax radiography; Bronchi; Chest Tubes; Humans; Intubation, Intratracheal; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumothorax; Retreatment"

The patient was recognized as a difficult-to-intubate patient and an endotracheal tube (ETT) was inserted through a bronchoscope. After one week of treatment, it was observed an endotracheal cuff perforation. Exchanging the endotracheal tube was necessary to achieve satisfactory pulmonary ventilation. An AEC Cook 14 was used to perform the reintubation. After reintubation, the patient presented a worsening in oxygen saturation and a chest radiography (CXR) revealed a large pneumothorax. A chest tube was inserted and we observed immediate improvement in oxygen saturation. A repeat CXR confirmed correct positioning of the chest tube and reexpansion of the right lung. A bronchoscopy performed showed a posterior laceration in the right main bronchus. The patient was extubated the following day. After four days, the chest tube was removed. A CXR performed a day after chest tube removal revealed a small right upper pneumothorax, but the patient remained asymptomatic.CONCLUSIONS: Airway exchange catheter is a valuable tool to handle with difficult-to-intubate patients. Although the physicians generally focus their attention in avoid barotrauma--caused by oxygen supplement or jet ventilation through AEC--concern for insertion technique can minimize life threatening complications and increase the safety of AEC.

Justificativa e objetivos: O hidroxietilamido 130/0,4 (HES 130/0,4) é considerado um expansor plasmático efetivo quando comparado com cristaloides. Há controvérsia sobre sua superioridade em relação à otimização hemodinâmica e sobre possíveis efeitos prejudiciais na coagulação. O objetivo deste estudo foi comparar os efeitos do HES 130/0,4 com os da solução de Ringer lactato durante artroplastia de quadril em pacientes adultos sob raquianestesia e levou em consideração sangramento intraoperatório, parâmetros hemodinâmicos, coagulograma, necessidade de transfusão e desfechos clínicos. Métodos: Neste estudo randômico e controlado, 48 pacientes agendados para artroplastia de quadril com raquianestesia foram alocados em dois grupos: 24 receberam uma pré-carga de HES 130/0,4 (15mL.kg-1) e 24 receberam uma pré-carga de solução de Ringer lactato (30mL. kg-1) antes da cirurgia. Mensurações hemodinâmicas, concentração de hemoglobina, parâmetros bioquímicos e testes de coagulação foram avaliados em três períodos durante o procedimento cirúrgico. Os pacientes receberam acompanhamento médico durante a internação e até 30 dias no período pós-operatório. O principal fator foi a necessidade de transfusão de hemácias entre os grupos durante a internação. Os fatores secundários foram parâmetros hemodinâmicos, tempo de internação, mortalidade e ocorrência de complicações clínicas. no período pós-operatório.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the serum level of B-type natriuretic peptide is a predictor of weaning failure from mechanical ventilation after cardiac surgery. Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study of 101 patients who underwent on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. B-type natriuretic peptide was measured postoperatively after intensive care unit admission and at the end of a 60-min spontaneous breathing test. The demographic data, hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, fluid balance, need for vasopressor or inotropic support, and length of the intensive care unit and hospital stays were recorded. Weaning failure was considered as either the inability to sustain spontaneous breathing after 60 min or the need for reintubation within 48 h. Results: Of the 101 patients studied, 12 patients failed the weaning trial. There were no differences between the groups in the baseline or intraoperative characteristics, including left ventricular function, EuroSCORE and lengths of the cardiac procedure and cardiopulmonary bypass. The B-type natriuretic peptide levels were significantly higher at intensive care unit admission and at the end of the breathing test in the patients with weaning failure compared with the patients who were successfully weaned. In a multivariate model, a high Btype natriuretic peptide level at the end of a spontaneous breathing trial was the only independent predictor of weaning failure from mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: A high B-type natriuretic peptide level is a predictive factor for the failure to wean from mechanical ventilation after cardiac surgery. These findings suggest that optimizing ventricular function should be a goal during the perioperative period. © 2013 CLINICS.",B-type natriuretic peptide; Cardiac surgery; Mechanical ventilation; Weaning failure,"biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; adult; age; aged; article; artificial ventilation; blood; epidemiology; female; heart surgery; heart ventricle function; hemodynamics; human; lung function test; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; postoperative period; predictive value; risk assessment; sex difference; time; treatment failure; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Biological Markers; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Postoperative Period; Predictive Value of Tests; Respiratory Function Tests; Risk Assessment; Sex Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Failure; Ventilator Weaning; Ventricular Dysfunction"

However, in some cases, this approach results in death or disability. The aim of this study is to highlight the anesthetics and perioperative aspects of patients undergoing insertion of a diaphragmatic pacemaker. METHODS: Five patients with quadriplegia following high cervical traumatic spinal cord injury and ventilatordependent chronic respiratory failure were implanted with a laparoscopic diaphragmatic pacemaker after preoperative assessments of their phrenic nerve function and diaphragm contractility through transcutaneous nerve stimulation. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01385384. RESULTS: The diaphragmatic pacemaker placement was successful in all of the patients. Two patients presented with capnothorax during the perioperative period, which resolved without consequences. After six months, three patients achieved continuous use of the diaphragm pacing system, and one patient could be removed from mechanical ventilation for more than 4 hours per day. CONCLUSIONS: The implantation of a diaphragmatic phrenic system is a new and safe technique with potential to improve the quality of life of patients who are dependent on mechanical ventilation because of spinal cord injuries. Appropriate indication and adequate perioperative care are fundamental to achieving better results. © 2012 CLINICS.",Anesthetic; Artificial diaphragm; Pacemaker; Perioperative management; Quadriplegia; Spinal cord injury,"adolescent; adult; anesthesia; article; artificial heart pacemaker; artificial ventilation; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diaphragm; electrostimulation therapy; female; human; implantation; laparoscopy; male; methodology; perioperative period; quadriplegia; spinal cord injury; time; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anesthesia; Diaphragm; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Pacemaker, Artificial; Perioperative Care; Perioperative Period; Prosthesis Implantation; Quadriplegia; Respiration, Artificial; Spinal Cord Injuries; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"

We sought to evaluate the clinical outcomes of children undergoing heart transplantation who required conversion from a cyclosporine-based, steroid-free therapy to a tacrolimus-based regimen. We performed a prospective, observational, cohort study of 28 children who underwent conversion from cyclosporine-based, steroid-free therapy to a tacrolimus-based therapy for refractory or late rejection or intolerance to cyclosporine. There was complete resolution of refractory rejection episodes and adverse side effects in all patients. The incidence rate (×100) of rejection episodes before and after conversion was 7.98 and 2.11, respectively (P ≤ .0001). There was a 25% mortality rate in patients using tacrolimus after a mean period of 60 months after conversion.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between fluid balance and clinical outcomes in these patients. Method One hundred twenty-two cancer patients were prospectively evaluated for survival during a 30-day period. Univariate (Chi-square, t-test, Mann-Whitney) and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify the admission parameters associated with mortality. Results The mean cumulative fluid balance was significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors [1675 ml/24 h (471-2921) vs. 887 ml/24 h (104-557), P = 0.017]. We used the area under the curve and the intersection of the sensibility and specificity curves to define a cumulative fluid balance value of 1100 ml/24 h. This value was used in the univariate model. In the multivariate model, the following variables were significantly associated with mortality in cancer patients: the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score at admission [Odds ratio (OR) 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.05-1.26), P = 0.003], the Lung Injury Score at admission [OR 2.23; 95% CI (1.29-3.87), P = 0.004] and a positive fluid balance higher than 1100 ml/24 h at ICU [OR 5.14; 95% CI (1.45-18.24), P = 0.011]. Conclusion A cumulative positive fluid balance higher than 1100 ml/24 h was independently associated with mortality in patients with cancer. These findings highlight the importance of improving the evaluation of these patients' volemic state and indicate that defined goals should be used to guide fluid therapy. © 2012 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.",,"adult; article; cancer patient; cancer survivor; chi square test; controlled study; critically ill patient; female; fluid balance; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; male; mortality; outcome assessment; positive fluid balance; priority journal; prospective study; rank sum test; Student t test; survival; Acute Kidney Injury; Aged; APACHE; Area Under Curve; Critical Illness; Female; Humans; Intubation, Intratracheal; Length of Stay; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Organ Failure; Neoplasms; Predictive Value of Tests; Respiration, Artificial; Shock, Septic; Survival; Treatment Outcome; Vasoconstrictor Agents; Water-Electrolyte Balance"

However, there are a few data regarding predictive factors for mortality in this group of patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether arterial lactate or standard base deficit on admission and after 24 hours can predict mortality for patients with cancer. METHODS: We evaluated 1,129 patients with severe sepsis, septic shock, or postoperative after high-risk surgery. Lactate and standard base deficit collected at admission and after 24 hours were compared between survivors and non-survivors. We evaluated whether these perfusion markers are independent predictors of mortality. RESULTS: There were 854 hospital survivors (76.5%). 24 h lactate >1.9 mmol/L and standard base deficit < -2.3 were independent predictors of intensive care unit mortality. 24 h lactate >1.9 mmol/L and 24 h standard base deficit < -2.3 mmol/Lwere independent predictors of hospital death. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that lactate and standard base deficit measurement should be included in the routine assessment of patients with cancer admitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis, septic shock or after highrisk surgery. These markers may be useful in the adequate allocation of resources in this population. © 2011 CLINICS.",Cancer; Critical care; Lactate; Mortality,lactic acid; article; blood; critical illness; disorders of acid base balance; female; human; male; middle aged; mortality; neoplasm; predictive value; survival; Acid-Base Imbalance; Critical Illness; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Lactic Acid; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Predictive Value of Tests; Survival Analysis

Lung tissue was submitted for viral and bacteriological analyses by real-time RT-PCR, and autopsy was conducted on all patients who died. Results: Eight patients were admitted, with ages ranging from 55 to 65 years old. There were five patients with solid organ tumors (62.5%) and three with hematological malignancies (37.5%). Five patients required mechanical ventilation and all died. Four patients had bacterial bronchopneumonia. All deaths occurred due to multiple organ failure. A milder form of lung disease was present in the three cases who survived. Lung tissue analysis was performed in all patients and showed diffuse alveolar damage in most patients. Other lung findings were necrotizing bronchiolitis or extensive hemorrhage. Conclusions: H1N1 viral infection in patients with cancer can cause severe illness, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. More data are needed to identify predictors of unfavorable evolution in these patients. © The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society for Medical Oncology.

Objective: To define whether a restrictive perioperative red blood cell transfusion strategy is as safe as a liberal strategy in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Design, Setting, and Patients: The Transfusion Requirements After Cardiac Surgery (TRACS) study, a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical noninferiority trial conducted between February 2009 and February 2010 in an intensive care unit at a university hospital cardiac surgery referral center in Brazil. Consecutive adult patients (n=502) who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were eligible; analysis was by intention-to-treat. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned to a liberal strategy of blood transfusion (to maintain a hematocrit ≥30%) or to a restrictive strategy (hematocrit ≥24%). Main Outcome Measure: Composite end point of 30-day all-cause mortality and severe morbidity (cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or acute renal injury requiring dialysis or hemofiltration) occurring during the hospital stay. The noninferiority margin was predefined at -8% (ie, 8% minimal clinically important increase in occurrence of the composite end point). Results: Hemoglobin concentrations were maintained at a mean of 10.5 g/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.4-10.6) in the liberal-strategy group and 9.1 g/dL (95% CI, 9.0-9.2) in the restrictive-strategy group (P < .001). A total of 198 of 253 patients (78%) in the liberal-strategy group and 118 of 249 (47%) in the restrictive-strategy group received a blood transfusion (P < .001). Occurrence of the primary end point was similar between groups (10% liberal vs 11 % restrictive; between-group difference, 1% [95% CI,-6% to 4%]; P=.85). Independent of transfusion strategy, the number of transfused red blood cell units was an independent risk factor for clinical complications or death at 30 days (hazard ratio for each additional unit transfused, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.4]; P=.002). Conclusion: Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the use of a restrictive perioperative transfusion strategy compared with a more liberal strategy resulted in noninferior rates of the combined outcome of 30-day all-cause mortality and severe morbidity. ©2010 American Medical Association.

Objectives: The autopsy findings of 21 Brazilian patients with con-firmed S-OIV infection are presented. These patients died in the winter of the southern hemisphere 2009 pandemic, with acute respiratory failure. Methods: Lung tissue was submitted to virologic and bacteriologic analysis with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and electron microscopy. Expression of toll-like receptor (TLR)-3, IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, CD8+ T cells and granzyme B+ cells in the lungs was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Measurements and Main Results: Patients were aged from 1 to 68 years (72% between 30 and 59 yr) and 12 were male. Sixteen patients had preexisting medical conditions. Diffuse alveolar damage was present in 20 individuals. In six patients, diffuse alveolar damage was associated with necrotizing bronchiolitis and in five with extensive hemorrhage. There was also a cytopathic effect in the bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, as well as necrosis, epithelial hyperplasia, and squamous metaplasia of the large airways. There was marked expression of TLR-3 and IFN-γ and a largenumber of CD8+ T cells and granzyme B+ cells within the lung tissue. Changes in other organs were mainly secondary to multiple organ failure. Conclusions: Autopsies have shown that the main pathological changes associated with S-OIV infection are localized to the lungs, where three distinct histological patterns can be identified. We also show evidence of ongoing pulmonary aberrant immune response. Our results reinforce the usefulness of autopsy in increasing the understanding of the novel human influenza A (H1N1) infection.",Autopsy; Bronchiolitis; Diffuse alveolar damage; Innate immunity; Virus,"gamma interferon; granzyme B; toll like receptor 3; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adolescent; adult; aged; article; asthma; autopsy; bacterial infection; Brazil; bronchiolitis; CD8+ T lymphocyte; child; clinical article; comorbidity; diffuse alveolar damage; disease severity; electron microscopy; female; human; human tissue; immune response; immunohistochemistry; Influenza virus A H1N1; innate immunity; lung alveolus epithelium; lung fibrosis; lung infection; male; multiple organ failure; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; viral respiratory tract infection; Adolescent; Aged; Autopsy; Bronchiolitis, Viral; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza, Human; Macrophages, Alveolar; Male; Middle Aged; Pulmonary Alveoli; Young Adult"

METHODS: We designed a prospective study in a university hospital where 109 consecutive patients were enrolled during a six-month period. All patients were scheduled for open-heart surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups. One group consisted of 55 patients and had a target glucose level of 80-130 mg/dl, while the other contained 54 patients and had a target glucose level of 160-200 mg/dl. These parameters were controlled during surgery and for 36 hours after surgery in the intensive care unit. Primary outcomes were clinical outcomes, including time of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit, infection, hypoglycemia, renal or neurological dysfunction, blood transfusion and length of stay in the hospital. The secondary outcome was a combined end-point (mortality at 30 days, infection or length of stay in the intensive care unit of more than 3 days). A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The anthropometric and clinical characteristics of the patients from each group were similar, except for weight and body mass index. The mean glucose level during the protocol period was 126.69 mg/dl in the treated group and 168.21 mg/dl in the control group (p<0.0016). There were no differences between groups regarding clinical outcomes, including the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit, blood transfusion, postoperative infection, hypoglycemic event, neurological dysfunction or 30-day mortality (p>0.05).

Static parameters such as the central venous pressure, the pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure, and the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension cannot accurately discriminate between responders and nonresponders to a fluid challenge. In this regard, respiratory-induced changes in arterial pulse pressure have been demonstrated to accurately predict preload responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients. Some experimental and clinical studies confirm the usefulness of arterial pulse pressure as a useful tool to guide fluid therapy in critically ill patients.

Until now, ΔPP has had to be calculated offline (from a computer recording or a paper printing of the arterial pressure curve), or to be derived from specific cardiac output monitors, limiting the widespread use of this parameter. Recently, a method has been developed for the automatic calculation and real-time monitoring of ΔPP using standard bedside monitors. Whether this method is to predict reliable predictor of fluid responsiveness remains to be determined. METHODS: We conducted a prospective clinical study in 59 mechanically ventilated patients in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery. Patients studied were considered at low risk for complications related to fluid administration (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure <20 mm Hg, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40%). All patients were instrumented with an arterial line and a pulmonary artery catheter. Cardiac filling pressures and cardiac output were measured before and after intravascular fluid administration (20 mL/kg of lactated Ringer's solution over 20 min), whereas ΔPP was automatically calculated and continuously monitored. RESULTS: Fluid administration increased cardiac output by at least 15% in 39 patients (66% = responders). Before fluid administration, responders and nonresponders were comparable with regard to right atrial and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures. In contrast, ΔPP was significantly greater in responders than in nonresponders (17% ± 3% vs 9% ± 2%, P < 0.001). The ΔPP cut-off value of 12% allowed identification of responders with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 95%. CONCLUSION: Automatic real-time monitoring of ΔPP is possible using a standard bedside monitor and was found to be a reliable method to predict fluid responsiveness after cardiac surgery. Additional studies are needed to determine if this technique can be used to avoid the complications of fluid administration in high-risk patients. © 2008 by International Anesthesia Research Society.",,"Ringer lactate solution; adult; aged; article; artificial ventilation; controlled study; female; fluid therapy; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart output; heart right atrium pressure; heart surgery; human; major clinical study; male; online monitoring; outcome assessment; postoperative period; priority journal; pulmonary artery catheter; pulmonary artery occlusion pressure; pulse pressure; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Automation; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Catheters, Indwelling; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Fluid Therapy; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Humans; Intensive Care; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Physiologic; Online Systems; Patient Selection; Postoperative Period; Pulse; Respiration, Artificial; Ventricular Function, Left"

However, the determinants of exactly which patients do receive transfusions remains to be defined and have been the subject of considerable debate in recent years. Concerns and doubts have emerged regarding the benefits and safety of blood transfusion, in part due to the lack of evidence of better outcomes resulting from randomized studies and in part related to the observations that transfusion may increase the risk of infection. As a result of these concerns and of several studies suggesting better or similar outcomes with a lower transfusion trigger, there has been a general tendency to decrease the transfusion threshold from the classic 10 g/dL to lower values. In this review, we focus on some of the key studies providing insight into current transfusion practices and fueling the current debate on the ideal transfusion trigger.",Anemia; Critically patients; Outcomes; Oxygen delivery; Transfusion,hemoglobin; anemia; blood component therapy; critical illness; human; review; risk; Anemia; Blood Component Transfusion; Critical Illness; Hemoglobins; Humans; Risk

METHODS: One hundred and six patients with reperfusion (WR) and 48 without reperfusion (WtR) who have received thrombolytic therapy in the acute phase of infarction were studied. ECG carried out on admission as well as on day 4 of patient's course were analyzed. ΔQT - defined as the difference between maximum and minimum QT interval - was measured by 12-lead ECG. RESULTS: The reperfusion group showed significant ΔQT reduction - from 89.66±20,47ms down to 70.95±21.65ms (p<0.001). On the other hand, the group without reperfusion showed ΔQT significant increase - from 81.27±20.52ms up to 91.85±24.66ms (p<0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that reduction magnitude beween pre- and post-thrombolysis ΔQT was the independent factor to most effectively identify coronary reperfusion (OR 1.045, p<0.0001; CI 95%). No significant difference was found in dispersion measures when patients with ventricular arrhythmias were compared with those with no arryhthmias in the course of the first 48 hours. CONCLUSION: The study shows that ΔQT is significantly reduced in patients with acute myocardial infarction submitted to successful thrombolysis, and is increased in infarcted patients with closed artery. ΔQT reduction between the pre- and post-thrombolysis condition was a predictor for coronary reperfusion of those patients, and did not show correlation to ventricular arrhythmias.",Acute myocardial infarction; Coronary reperfusion; QT dispersion,fibrinolytic agent; lead; acute heart infarction; article; controlled study; coronary reperfusion; dose response; electrocardiogram; fibrinolytic therapy; heart ventricle arrhythmia; hospital admission; human; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; QT dispersion; Anti-Arrhythmia Agents; Electrocardiography; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Humans; Long QT Syndrome; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Reperfusion; Thrombolytic Therapy

Ascending genital infection in women leads to the predominant complication, acute salpingitis, one of the most common causes of female infertility in the world. Since the 1990s, a remarkable surge of information ensued regarding the pathogenesis of gonorrhea and its agent. Gonorrohea has proven difficult to control in most populations and remains a prime example of the influence that social, behavioral, and demographic factors can have on the epidemiology of an infectious disease. The management of gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted infections requires both treatment of the patient as an individual and of his or her sexual partner(s) as a public health measure to interrupt the onward spread of infection and prevent long-term complications.",Gonorrhea; Neisseria gonorhoeae,antibiotic agent; azithromycin; cefixime; ceftriaxone; ciprofloxacin; doxycycline; ofloxacin; penicillin G; antibiotic therapy; behavior; clinical feature; demography; female infertility; gonorrhea; human; infection control; Neisseria gonorrhoeae; perinatal infection; review; salpingitis; social aspect; female; gonorrhea; male; public health; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Neisseria; Neisseria gonorrhoeae; Female; Gonorrhea; Humans; Male; Public Health

Although initially withdrawn from the world market when its use was associated with teratogenicity, thalidomide has been gradually re-introduced in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Its action on the immunologic system is pleomorfic, including potent inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-α, decrease of the ratio of CD4 to CD8 and suppression of phagocytosis. Diseases for which thalidomide has been found effective include: erythema nodosum leprosum, lupus erythematosus, graft-versus-host-disease, aphtous stomatitis, Behcet's syndrome, actinic prurigo, prurigo nodularis and others. Side effects such as peripheral neuropathy and teratogenicity remain its limiting factor. Acquiring more knowledge about its mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics and side effects will allow thalidomide to be used appropriately in many conditions.",Adverse effects; Immunosuppressive agents; Thalidomide; Therapeutic use,thalidomide; tumor necrosis factor alpha; antiinflammatory activity; aphthous stomatitis; Behcet disease; clinical trial; constipation; drug efficacy; drug indication; drug safety; erythema nodosum leprosum; graft versus host reaction; human; immunomodulation; immunosuppressive treatment; nonhuman; oral drug administration; peripheral neuropathy; prurigo; review; systemic lupus erythematosus; teratogenicity; xerostomia
