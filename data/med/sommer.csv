Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,The Identification of Calcified Coronary Plaque Is Associated With Initiation and Continuation of Pharmacological and Lifestyle Preventive Therapies: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026876917&doi=10.1016%2fj.jcmg.2017.01.030&partnerID=40&md5=d279de86084850bee7e99dcff83ac361,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the odds of initiation or continuation of pharmacological and lifestyle preventive therapies in patients with nonzero versus zero coronary artery calcium (CAC) score detected on cardiac computed tomography. Background Detection of calcified coronary plaque could serve as a motivational tool for physicians and patients to intensify preventive therapies. Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database), Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL (Cochrane central register of controlled trials), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for studies evaluating the association of CAC scores with downstream pharmacological or lifestyle interventions for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) of downstream interventions were obtained using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. Results After a review of 6,256 citations and 54 full-text papers, 6 studies (11,256 participants, mean follow-up time: 1.6 to 6.0 years) were included. Pooled estimates of the odds of aspirin initiation (OR: 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8 to 3.8), lipid-lowering medication initiation (OR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.9 to 4.4), blood pressure–lowering medication initiation (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.6 to 2.3), lipid-lowering medication continuation (OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.6 to 3.3), increase in exercise (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.4 to 2.4), and dietary change (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.5 to 2.5) were higher in individuals with nonzero CAC versus zero CAC scores, but not for aspirin or blood pressure–lowering medication continuation. When assessed within individual studies, these findings remained significant after adjustment for baseline patient characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that nonzero CAC score, identifying calcified coronary plaque, significantly increases the likelihood of initiation or continuation of pharmacological and lifestyle therapies for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation",cardiovascular prevention; coronary calcium score; meta-analysis,
Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,The expected cardiovascular benefit of plasma cholesterol lowering with or without LDL-C targets in healthy individuals at higher cardiovascular risk,2017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85023770341&doi=10.5935%2fabc.20170089&partnerID=40&md5=438accc7dac589ee681ad5157fa03888,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Background: There is controversy whether management of blood cholesterol should be based or not on LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) target concentrations. Objectives: To compare the estimated impact of different lipid-lowering strategies, based or not on LDL-c targets, on the risk of major cardiovascular events in a population with higher cardiovascular risk. Methods: We included consecutive individuals undergoing a routine health screening in a single center who had a 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) ≥ 7.5% (pooled cohort equations, ACC/AHA, 2013). For each individual, we simulated two strategies based on LDL-c target (≤ 100 mg/dL [Starget-100] or ≤ 70 mg/dL [Starget-70]) and two strategies based on percent LDL-c reduction (30% [S30%] or 50% [S50%]). Results: In 1,897 subjects (57 ± 7 years, 96% men, 10-year ASCVD risk 13.7 ± 7.1%), LDL-c would be lowered from 141 ± 33 mg/dL to 99 ± 23 mg/dL in S30%, 71 ± 16 mg/dL in S50%, 98 ± 9 mg/dL in Starget-100, and 70 ± 2 mg/dL in Starget-70. Ten-year ASCVD risk would be reduced to 8.8 ± 4.8% in S50% and 8.9 ± 5.2 in Starget-70. The number of major cardiovascular events prevented in 10 years per 1,000 individuals would be 32 in S30%, 31 in Starget-100, 49 in S50%, and 48 in Starget-70. Compared with Starget-70, S50% would prevent more events in the lower LDL-c tertile and fewer events in the higher LDL-c tertile. Conclusions: The more aggressive lipid-lowering approaches simulated in this study, based on LDL-c target or percent reduction, may potentially prevent approximately 50% more hard cardiovascular events in the population compared with the less intensive treatments. Baseline LDL-c determines which strategy (based or not on LDL-c target) is more appropriate at the individual level. © 2017, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,Cardiovascular risk stratification and statin eligibility based on the Brazilian vs. North american guidelines on blood cholesterol management,2017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85023763455&doi=10.5935%2fabc.20170088&partnerID=40&md5=00b9880cf1c52a6d452c15a5baaa16be,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Background: The best way to select individuals for lipid-lowering treatment in the population is controversial. Objective: In healthy individuals in primary prevention: (1) to assess the relationship between cardiovascular risk categorized according to the V Brazilian Guideline on Dyslipidemia and the risk calculated by the pooled cohort equations (PCE); (2) to compare the proportion of individuals eligible for statins, according to different criteria. Methods: In individuals aged 40-75 years consecutively submitted to routine health assessment at one single center, four criteria of eligibility for statin were defined: BR-1, BR-2 (LDL-c above or at least 30 mg/dL above the goal recommended by the Brazilian Guideline, respectively), USA-1 and USA-2 (10-year risk estimated by the PCE ≥ 5.0% or ≥ 7.5%, respectively). Results: The final sample consisted of 13,947 individuals (48 ± 6 years, 71% men). Most individuals at intermediate or high risk based on the V Brazilian Guideline had a low risk calculated by the PCE, and more than 70% of those who were considered at high risk had this categorization because of the presence of aggravating factors. Among women, 24%, 17%, 4% and 2% were eligible for statin use according to the BR-1, BR-2, USA-1 and USA-2 criteria, respectively (p < 0.01). The respective figures for men were 75%, 58%, 31% and 17% (p < 0.01). Eighty-five percent of women and 60% of men who were eligible for statin based on the BR-1 criterion would not be candidates for statin based on the USA-1 criterion. Conclusions: As compared to the North American Guideline, the V Brazilian Guideline considers a substantially higher proportion of the population as eligible for statin use in primary prevention. This results from discrepancies between the risk stratified by the Brazilian Guideline and that calculated by the PCE, particularly because of the risk reclassification based on aggravating factors. © 2017, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,Insulin resistance is associated with carotid intima-media thickness in non-diabetic subjects. A cross-sectional analysis of the ELSA-Brasil cohort baseline,2017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015751028&doi=10.1016%2fj.atherosclerosis.2017.03.011&partnerID=40&md5=97fb3c5777fe012d3bb3fdf43cbc2675,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Background and aims Epidemiological studies have analyzed the association between carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and insulin resistance, glucose levels or glycated hemoglobin with mixed results. We aimed to evaluate the association between CIMT and homeostasis model assessment – insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting and post-load plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) baseline. Methods We included 8028 participants (aged 35–74 years) without diabetes or overt cardiovascular disease who had complete CIMT data at baseline. We built crude and adjusted linear and binary logistic models to evaluate the association between CIMT and (a) HOMA-IR; (b) fasting plasma glucose; (c) post-load plasma glucose; and (d) glycated hemoglobin. We also built post-hoc models, stratified by sex. Results In the fully-adjusted linear models, only the association between CIMT (in mm) and HOMA-IR remained significant (β = 0.004; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]:0.001 to 0.006). Consistent with these results, only the association between the highest age- sex- and race-specific CIMT quartile and HOMA-IR was significant in the adjusted logistic model (odds ratio [OR]:1.10; 95% CI:1.04–1.17). The association between HOMA-IR and the highest CIMT quartile remained significant in sex-specific analyses (OR:1.10; 95% CI:1.02–1.20 for men and OR:1.10; 95% CI:1.02–1.20 for women). We did not find an independent association between CIMT and glucose or glycated hemoglobin. Conclusions We found a direct association between HOMA-IR and CIMT in a large sample of non-diabetic participants. Mechanisms unrelated to glucose homeostasis, as a direct effect of insulin on atherosclerosis, or medial hypertrophy, may be involved. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Glycemic; Hyperinsulinemia; Insulin; Medial hypertrophy; Metabolism; Subclinical atherosclerosis,

To provide further evidence for the potential relevance of TRL-C and atherosclerosis, we have evaluated the relation between TRL-C and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. We included 3,845 subjects (49.9 ± 8.4 years, 54% women) who had no history of CVD, were not using lipid-lowering medications, and underwent CAC evaluation. We assessed the relation between increasing fasting TRL-C and the graded increase in CAC and to what extent TRL-C were independently associated with CAC over and above LDL-C using logistic regression models. Overall, 973 (25%) of the participants had a CAC >0 and 308 (8%) had a CAC >100. The median TRL-C level was 22 mg/dL (IQR 16 to 32). Subjects with CAC >0 had higher TRL-C levels than those with CAC = 0 (p <0.001). Similarly, subjects with CAC >0 had higher levels of LDL-C, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all p <0.001). After multivariate adjustment, log-transformed TRL-C remained associated with the presence and severity of CAC (all p <0.05). When TRL-C was added to models that contained demographic factors and conventional lipids, it significantly improved the model to predict the presence of CAC >0 (p = 0.01). In conclusion, in a large cohort of asymptomatic subjects, TRL-C was associated with subclinical atherosclerosis supporting a potentially causal role in CVD. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,"C reactive protein; cholesterol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipoprotein; lipoprotein cholesterol; lipoprotein triglyceride; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; blood; blood vessel calcification; Brazil; coronary artery disease; diagnostic imaging; diet restriction; female; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; multivariate analysis; statistical model; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Brazil; C-Reactive Protein; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Coronary Artery Disease; Fasting; Female; Humans; Lipoproteins; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Triglycerides; Vascular Calcification"

We aimed to analyze this association using baseline data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). Methods: Cross-sectionally, we included subjects with normal thyroid function and with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). We excluded individuals using medications that affect thyroid function. Linear and logistic regression models evaluated GFR estimated by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-Epi) and albuminuria/creatinine ratio as dependent variables and thyrotropin quartiles in individuals with euthyroidism and SCH as independent variables, adjusted for demographical characteristics and diseases related to CKD. Results: We included 13,193 subjects with a median age of 51 years [interquartile range, (IQR): 45–58], 6840 (51.8%) women, 12,416 (94.1%) euthyroid, and 777 (5.9%) with SCH. SCH subjects were characterized by higher age, triglycerides, frequency of white race, cardiovascular disease, CKD, and former smokers. In adjusted models, log-transformed TSH in euthyroid subjects was inversely and strongly associated with CKD (β = −2.181, 95% CI −2.714 to −1.648), P < 0.0001 for glomerular filtration rate and 4.528 (1.190–7.865) for albuminuria/creatinine ratio. Multivariate logistic models for euthyroid subjects showed an OR of 1.45 (95% CI 1.15–1.83) for GFR and of 1.95 (95% CI 1.08–3.54) for albuminuria/creatinine ratio in the fourth quartile of TSH using the first as the reference.

Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,Obstructive sleep apnea is independently associated with subclinical coronary atherosclerosis among middle-aged women,2017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978036080&doi=10.1007%2fs11325-016-1374-4&partnerID=40&md5=f3287c450895349d4a0f4b55347c79e6,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Purpose: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with coronary disease among men. However, this association is not clear for women. In this study, we evaluate the association between OSA and presence of subclinical atherosclerosis assessed by tomographic coronary calcium score in middle-aged women. Methods: We evaluated consecutive women aged between 45 and 65 years in perimenopause or postmenopause period (with menstrual irregularity—amenorrhea &gt; 60 days), without manifest cardiovascular disease (heart failure, coronary disease, and stroke), from two gynecologic clinics. All patients underwent clinical evaluation, computed tomographic examination for coronary artery calcium (CAC &gt; 100 Agatston units), and portable sleep study. Multiple logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between OSA and CAC, controlling for traditional risk factors including Framingham Risk Score (FRS), body mass index (BMI), and diabetes. Results: We studied 214 women (age 56 years (52–61); BMI 28 kg/m2 (25–31), 25 % diabetes, 62 % hypertension). OSA (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥5 events/h) was diagnosed in 82 women (38.3 %). CAC was more prevalent in patients with moderate/severe OSA (AHI ≥15 events/h) than in patients without or with mild OSA, 19 % vs 4.5 and 1.6 %, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). Moderate to severe OSA was associated with CAC in unadjusted (odds ratio = 6.25, 95 % CI 1.66–23.52; p &lt; 0.01) and adjusted (odds ratio = 8.19, 95 % CI 1.66–40.32; p = 0.01) logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: Moderate to severe OSA is independently associated with the presence of CAC in middle-aged women. These results reinforce the concept that women are also susceptible to the cardiovascular consequences of OSA. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Atherosclerosis; Coronary heart disease; Obstructive sleep apnea; Women,

Thus, data on the outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in this population is scarce. In this study, we aimed to determine the impact of CABG on the clinical and functional status, as well as graft patency in those individuals. Methods Patients with severe and diffuse CAD who underwent incomplete CABG due to complex anatomy or extensive distal coronary involvement were evaluated preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. Postoperative coronary angiography was performed to evaluate graft patency. Graft occlusion was defined as the complete absence of opacification of the target vessel. Stratified analysis of graft occlusion was performed by graft type and territories, defined as left anterior descending artery (LAD), the left circumflex branch, and the right coronary artery territories; the latter two, grouped, were further classified as non-LAD territory. Results A total of 57 patients were included, in whom 131 grafts were placed. There was a significant improvement in Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina symptom severity (Z = –6.1; p < 0.001) and maximum oxygen uptake (p < 0.001), with a corresponding decrease in the use of long-acting nitrates (p < 0.001). The overall graft occlusion rate was 19.1%, with no significant difference between LAD and non-LAD territories (p = 0.08). However, a significantly lower occlusion rate was noted for the internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts when compared with saphenous vein grafts (p = 0.01), though this difference was only significant in the LAD territory (p = 0.04). Overall, the use of venous graft was the only predictor occlusion at 1 year (odds ratio: 4.03; p = 0.016). Conclusion In patients with diffuse CAD, incomplete CABG surgery resulted in a significant clinical improvement, with acceptable graft occlusion rates at 1 year, particularly for IMA grafts to the LAD territory.

We evaluated the ATX association with the presence and extent of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in heterozygous FH patients. Methods: 102 FH patients diagnosed by US-MEDPED criteria (67% with genetically proven FH), with median LDL-C 279 mg/dL (interquartile range: 240; 313), asymptomatic for cardiovascular disease, underwent computed tomography angiography and coronary artery calcium (CAC) quantification. Subclinical coronary atherosclerosis was quantified by CAC, segment-stenosis (SSS) and segment-involvement (SIS) scores. Adjusted Poisson regression was used to assess the association of ATX with subclinical atherosclerosis burden as continuous variables. Results: Patients with ATX (n = 21, 21%) had higher LDL-C and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations as well as greater CAC scores, SIS and SSS (p < 0.05). After adjusting for age, sex, smoking, hypertension, previous statin use, HDL-C, LDL-C and Lp(a) concentrations, there was an independent positive association of ATX presence with CAC scores (β = 1.017, p < 0.001), SSS (β = 0.809, p < 0.001) and SIS (β = 0.640, p < 0.001). Conclusions: ATX are independently associated with the extension of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis quantified by tomographic scores in FH patients. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Atherosclerosis; Calcium score; Computed tomography; Familial hypercholesterolemia; Xanthomas,

We aimed to study the association of tobacco use and prior cessation with the presence, extent and severity of atherosclerosis on coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Methods We examined 1798 consecutive symptomatic patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for CTA, stratified by smoking status (never, current [within 30 days], or former [>30 days before CTA]). Plaque severity (none, <50%, ≥50% stenosis), composition (non-calcified [NCP], partially calcified [PCP], or calcified plaque [CP]), and segment involvement score (SIS) were visually graded. Multivariate analysis was performed, adjusting for CAD risk factors and cholesterol lowering medication use. Results The median age of patients was 50 years [IQR:42–58] (61% male), with 74% never smokers, 12% current smokers, and 14% former smokers (median quit duration = 12 years [IQR:3–26]). Smoking exposure in former versus current smokers was 11 [IQR:5–25] and 10 [IQR:2–20] pack-years, respectively (p = 0.01). Compared to never smokers, current smokers demonstrated an increased odds ratio of all plaque types (adjusted OR: any NCP = 1.55 [95% CI 1.04–2.32], p = 0.03; any PCP = 1.61 [1.10–2.37], p = 0.02; any CP = 1.93 [1.32–2.81], p = 0.001), non-obstructive CAD (aOR = 1.47 [1.04, 2.07], p = 0.03), obstructive CAD (aOR = 1.81 [1.01–3.24], p = 0.047), and SIS > 4 (aOR = 1.60 [1.04–2.46], p = 0.03). Compared to current smoking, prior smoking cessation (≥12 years) was associated with a decreased odds ratio of any NCP (aOR = 0.42 [0.19–0.90], p = 0.03), CP (aOR = 0.43 [0.22–0.84], p = 0.02), and obstructive CAD (aOR = 0.40, [0.15–0.98], p = 0.048). Conclusions Current smoking is independently associated with the presence and extent of coronary plaque, and a higher risk of non-obstructive and obstructive CAD compared to never smoking. Prior smoking cessation correlated with improvements in CTA-identified plaque measures. © 2016",Atherosclerosis; Coronary artery disease; Coronary computed tomographic angiography; Smoking; Tobacco,

Methods: Retrospective cohort study of 1118 patients, who underwent coronary CTA at two centers from September 2004 to October 2011. Coronary CTA were categorized as normal, nonobstructive CAD (&lt;50%), or obstructive CAD (≥50%) in addition to segment involvement (SIS) and stenosis scores. Extensive CAD was defined as SIS &gt; 4. Association of BMI with cardiovascular prognosis was evaluated using multivariable fractional polynomial models. Results: Mean age of the cohort was 57 ± 13 years with median follow-up of 3.2 years. Increasing BMI was associated with MetS (OR 1.28 per 1 kg/m2, p &lt; 0.001) and burden of CAD on a univariable basis, but not after multivariable adjustment. Prognosis demonstrated a J-shaped relationship with BMI. For BMI from 20-39.9 kg/m2, after adjustment for age, gender, and smoking, MetS (HR 2.23, p = 0.009) was more strongly associated with adverse events. Conclusions: Compared to normal BMI, there was an increased burden of CAD for BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2. Within each BMI category, metabolically unhealthy patients had greater extent of CAD, as measured by CCTA, compared to metabolically healthy patients. © 2017 The Author(s).",Cohort; Coronary artery disease; Coronary computed tomography angiography; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity; Prognosis,adult; age; Article; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; cohort analysis; computed tomographic angiography; computed tomography scanner; controlled study; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; disease association; disease severity; female; gender; human; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; obesity; prevalence; prognosis; retrospective study; smoking

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 4104 participants (mean age = 50.9 ± 8.8 years old, 54% female) from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health had complete information for CAC and cognitive tests. We used linear regression models adjusted for sociodemographics, cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and body mass index), depression, and thyroid function. To investigate potential different associations for middle-aged and older adults, we stratified the analysis by age groups. Results: Participants with CAC ≥ 100 Agatston score had poorer performance in the trail making test compared to those with CAC < 100 Agatston score (β = -0.101, 95% CI = -0.194; -0.010, p = 0.03). We did not find any other association between CAC and cognitive tests. When we investigated the effect modification between CAC and age on cognitive tests, only the effect modification on global cognition (p = 0.02) and trail making test was significant (p = 0.0003). Conclusions: Higher CAC was weakly associated with poorer performance in an executive function test in a large sample from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Atherosclerosis; Calcinosis; Cognition; Coronary artery; Dementia,

We aimed to prospectively examine the effects of self-initiated longitudinal PAL changes on body mass index (BMI) and cardiometabolic parameters in normal weight, overweight and obese adults. Methods and results We included 4840 adults (mean age 41.6 ± 7.9 years, 79% male) undergoing routine health screening examinations. Self-reported PAL, height, weight, blood pressure and blood samples were collected at baseline and after a mean (95% confidence interval) follow up of 536 (531–541) days. Subjects were stratified according to BMI [39.8% normal weight (&lt;25 kg/m2), 45.1% overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m2), and 19.1% obese (≥30 kg/m2)]. In normal weight individuals, BMI increased from baseline to follow-up, irrespective of PAL changes. On the other hand, overweight and obese individuals that increased PAL experienced a decrease in BMI by −0.9% and −3.1%, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Overweight and obese individuals that increased PAL also experienced a decrease in −5.8% -4.6% in non-HDL concentrations from baseline to follow-up (p &lt; 0.05). Finally, in overweight individuals, LDL cholesterol concentrations decreased from baseline to follow-up, irrespective of PAL changes whereas in obese individuals, a maintenance or increased PAL were associated with a decrease in −4.7% and −6.1% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. Conclusions In a large cohort of screening patients, longitudinal self-initiated PAL is associated with improved BMI and cardiometabolic profile in overweight and obese individuals. © 2016 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University",Body mass index; Cardiovascular risk; Exercise; Triglycerides,
Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,Lack of association between subclinical hypothyroidism and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity in a cross-sectional analysis of the ELSA-Brasil,2017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014933725&doi=10.1093%2fajh%2fhpw117&partnerID=40&md5=b6edda39ff3cf78210f2cc2b5015ce7a,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"BACKGROUND There is little available data on carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) in subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). We aimed to analyze the association between SCH and cf-PWV using baseline data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). METHODS We included subjects with normal thyroid function (thyrotropin (TSH): 0.4-4.0 mIU/l, and normal free thyroxine (FT4: 0.8-1.9 ng/dl) and SCH (TSH > 4.0 mIU/l and normal FT4) evaluated for cf-PWV in a crosssectional analysis. We excluded individuals using medications that interfere in thyroid function, antihypertensives, or diuretics, and subjects with chronic kidney disease or previous cardiovascular disease. Generalized linear and logistic regression models evaluated cf-PWV as a dependent variable and SCH as an independent variable, adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS Of 8,341 subjects (52.3% women), 7,878 (94.4%) were euthyroid and 463 (5.6%) showed SCH. The median age was 50 years (interquartile range: 44-56). The groups differed by age, sex, body mass index, glomerular filtration rate, and C-reactive protein. SCH was not associated with cf-PWV in the full-adjusted linear model (β = -0.039; P = 0.562) and with cf-PWV >75th percentile in the full-adjusted logistic model (odds ratio = 0.94; 95% confidence interval = 0.72-1.22).

Our aim was to analyse the association between TSH quintiles and subclinical atherosclerosis measured by CAC, using baseline data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). Design: Cross-sectional study. Patients: We excluded individuals using medications that affect thyroid function and who self-reported cardiovascular disease. We included euthyroid subjects and individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCHypo) and subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCHyper). Logistic regression models evaluated CAC >100 Agatston units as the dependent variable, and increasing quintiles of TSH as the independent variable, adjusted for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Results: Our sample included 3836 subjects, mean age 49 years (interquartile range 44-56); 1999 (52.1%) were female, 3551 (92.6%) were euthyroid, 239 (6.2%) had SCHypo and 46 (1.2%) had SCHyper. The frequency of women, White people and never smokers as well as body mass index and insulin resistance increased according to quintiles. The 1st quintile for TSH (0-0.99 mIU/L) was associated with CAC >100, using the 3rd quintile (1.39-1.85 mIU/L) as reference (adjusted OR=1.57, 95% CI: 1.05-2.35, P=.027), but no association was shown for the 5th quintile (2.68-35.5 mIU/L) compared to the 3rd. Restricting the analysis to euthyroid subjects did not change the results. For women, but not for men, we observed a U-shaped curve with 1st and 5th TSH quintiles associated with CAC>100. Conclusion: Low and low-normal (1st quintile) TSH levels were associated with CAC>100 Agatston units in a sample with subclinical thyroid disorders and euthyroid subjects. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Cardiovascular disease; Coronary artery calcification; Subclinical atherosclerosis; Subclinical hyperthyroidism; Subclinical hypothyroidism; Subclinical thyroid disease; Thyroid disorders; Thyrotrophin levels,

In the present study we evaluated the prognostic value of left ventricular area adjusted for the body surface area (LVA-BSA) measured by non-contrast cardiac CT to predict incident HF and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Methods We studied left ventricular dimensions and calculated LVA-BSA in 6781 participants of the MESA study (mean age: was 62 ± 10 years, 53% females; 62% non-white) free from prior HF who underwent non-contrast cardiac CT to evaluate the coronary artery calcium score (CAC) at baseline and were followed up for a median of 10.2 years. Results During follow up, 237 (3.5%) incident HF and 475 (7.0%) CVD events occurred. After adjustment for clinical variables and CAC, LVA-BSA was significantly associated with incident HF (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.10 per 100 mm2/m2, p &lt; 0.001) and CVD events (HR: 1.07 per 100 mm2/m2, p &lt; 0.001). The area under the ROC curve for the prediction of incident HF improved from 0.787 on a model including only risk factors to 0.798 when CAC was added (p = 0.02), and to 0.816 with the additional inclusion of LVA-BSA (p = 0.007). Similar improvements for the prediction of CVD events were noted. Conclusion In an ethnically diverse population of asymptomatic individuals free from baseline CVD or HF, the left ventricular area measured by non-contrast cardiac CT is a strong predictor of incident HF events beyond traditional risk factors and CAC score. © 2016 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography",Heart failure; Left ventricle size; Non-contrast cardiac computed tomography; Prognosis,"antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; adult; antihypertensive therapy; Article; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular disease; computed tomography scanner; computer assisted tomography; coronary artery calcium score; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; female; follow up; Han Chinese; heart failure; heart left ventricle; human; hypertension; left anterior descending coronary artery; major clinical study; male; prediction; priority journal; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; systolic blood pressure; aged; area under the curve; blood vessel calcification; chi square distribution; clinical trial; computed tomographic angiography; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; diagnostic imaging; epidemiology; ethnology; heart failure; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart ventricle; incidence; middle aged; multicenter study; multivariate analysis; pathophysiology; predictive value; procedures; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; risk factor; time factor; United States; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Area Under Curve; Chi-Square Distribution; Computed Tomography Angiography; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Female; Heart Failure; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Predictive Value of Tests; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; ROC Curve; Time Factors; United States; Vascular Calcification"
Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,Epicardial fat is associated with severity of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in familial hypercholesterolemia,2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84989278686&doi=10.1016%2fj.atherosclerosis.2016.09.010&partnerID=40&md5=ab82c56e0c603b43b975592d7156cc97,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Background and aims Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by elevated blood cholesterol, increased prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis and high risk of premature coronary heart disease. However, this risk is not explained solely by elevated LDL-cholesterol concentrations, and other factors may influence atherosclerosis development. There is evidence that increased adiposity may predispose to atherosclerosis in FH. Epicardial fat has been associated with subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in the general population. This study evaluated the association of epicardial fat (EFV) volume with the presence and extent of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis detected by computed tomography angiography in FH patients. Methods Ninety-seven FH subjects (35% male, mean age 45 ± 13 years, LDL-C 281 ± 56 mg/dL, 67% with proven molecular defects) underwent computed tomography angiography and coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring. EFV was measured in non-contrast images using a semi-automated method. Segment-stenosis score (SSS) and segment-involvement score (SIS) were calculated. Multivariate Poisson regression was utilized to assess an independent association of EFV with coronary atherosclerotic burden. Results EFV was positively associated with age, body mass index, waist circumference, blood glucose, the presence of the metabolic syndrome components, but not with LDL-C. After adjusting for confounders and abdominal circumference, an independent association (shown as β coefficients and 95% confidence intervals) of EVF with CAC scores [β = 0.263 (0.234; 0.292), p=0.000], SIS [β = 0.304 (0.141; 0.465) p=0.000] and SSS [β = 0.296 (0.121; 0.471), p=0.001] was found. Conclusions In FH, EFV was independently associated with coronary atherosclerotic presence and severity. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Atherosclerosis; Calcium score; Computed tomography; Epicardial fat; Familial hypercholesterolemia; Obesity,

We aimed to analyze the association between SCH and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) using baseline data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). Methods and Results We included subjects with normal thyroid function (TSH: 0.4–4.0 mIU/l, and normal free thyroxine (FT4): 0.8–1.9 ng/dl) and SCH (TSH ≥ 4.0 mIU/l and normal FT4) evaluated for IMT in a cross-sectional analysis. We excluded individuals using medications that affect thyroid function and those with a history of cardiovascular disease. We performed logistic and linear regression models to evaluate the association with IMT (mean values and categorized at the 75th percentile) as a dependent variable and SCH as an independent variable, adjusted for other cardiovascular risk factors. From 8623 subjects (median age of 50 years; interquartile range: 44–57), 4624 (53.6%) were women, 8095 (93.9%) were euthyroid, and 528 (6.1%) had SCH. Groups varied in age, body mass index, Framingham risk score, Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), C-reactive protein, as well as, IMT, that were all higher in SCH compared to euthyroid participants. SCH is associated with IMT as a continuous variable (β = 0.010, P = 0.036) and IMT >75th percentile: OR = 1.30 (95% CI = 1.06–1.59) in logistic models. Conclusion Individuals with SCH presented higher IMT compared with euthyroid subjects, even after adjustment for potential confounders.

Objectives: The main objective was to investigate if the unit of first contact influenced the frequency and time of aspirin treatment in the Strategy of Registry of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ERICO) study. Methods: We analyzed the pharmacological treatment time in 830 ERICO participants - 700 individuals for whom the hospital was the unit of first contact and 130 who initially sought primary care units. We built logistic regression models to study whether the unit of first contact was associated with a treatment time of less than three hours. Results: Individuals who went to primary care units received the first aspirin dose in those units in 75.6% of the cases. The remaining 24.4% received aspirin at the hospital. Despite this finding, individuals from primary care still had aspirin administered within three hours more frequently than those who went to the hospital (76.8% vs 52.6%; p<0.001 and 100% vs. 70.7%; p=0.001 for non ST-elevation ACS and ST-elevation myocardial infarction, respectively). In adjusted models, individuals coming from primary care were more likely to receive aspirin more quickly (odds ratio: 3.66; 95% confidence interval: 2.06-6.51). Conclusions: In our setting, individuals from primary care were more likely to receive aspirin earlier. Enhancing the ability of primary care units to provide early treatment and safe transportation may be beneficial in similar settings. © 2016, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,Race and Resting-State Heart Rate Variability in Brazilian Civil Servants and the Mediating Effects of Discrimination: An ELSA-Brasil Cohort Study,2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976596503&doi=10.1097%2fPSY.0000000000000359&partnerID=40&md5=a62f6e04305b94cfc70e2f394af3d51d,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Objectives: African Americans are characterized by higher heart rate variability (HRV), a finding ostensibly associated with beneficial health outcomes. However, these findings are at odds with other evidence that blacks have worse cardiovascular outcomes. Here, we examine associations in a large cohort from the ELSA-Brasil study and determined whether these effects are mediated by discrimination. Methods: Three groups were compared on the basis of self-declared race: ""black"" (n = 2,020), ""brown"" (n = 3,502), and ""white"" (n = 6,467). Perceived discrimination was measured using a modified version of the Everyday Discrimination Scale. Resting-state HRV was extracted from 10-minute resting-state electrocardiograms. Racial differences in HRV were determined by regression analyses weighted by propensity scores, which controlled for potentially confounding variables including age, sex, education, and other health-related information. Nonlinear mediation analysis quantified the average total effect, comprising direct (race-HRV) and indirect (race-discrimination-HRV) pathways. Results: Black participants displayed higher HRV relative to brown (Cohen's d = 0.20) and white participants (Cohen's d = 0.31). Brown relative to white participants also displayed a small but significantly higher HRV (Cohen's d = 0.14).Discrimination indirectly contributed to the effects of race on HRV. Conclusions: This large cohort from the Brazilian population shows that HRV is greatest in black, followed by brown, relative to white participants. The presence of higher HRVin these groups may reflect a sustained compensatory psychophysiological response to the adverse effects of discrimination. Additional research is needed to determine the health consequences of these differences in HRVacross racial and ethnic groups. © Copyright 2016 by the American Psychosomatic Society.",discrimination; heart rate variability; HRV; mediation analysis; propensity score weighting; race,adult; Article; Brazilian; cohort analysis; confounding variable; controlled study; electrocardiogram; female; genotype environment interaction; heart rate variability; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; propensity score; race difference; racism; regression analysis; resting heart rate; aged; ancestry group; Black person; Brazil; Caucasian; ethnology; government employee; heart rate; middle aged; physiology; statistics and numerical data; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; Aged; Brazil; Continental Population Groups; European Continental Ancestry Group; Government Employees; Heart Rate; Humans; Middle Aged; Racism

Several small cohort studies have evaluated the ability of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict adverse cardiovascular events. However, studies have yielded inconsistent results, and some analyses were underpowered. Therefore, we sought to systematically review and perform meta-analysis of the prognostic value of cardiac MRI for patients with known or suspected cardiac sarcoidosis. Methods and Results - We systematically searched for cohort studies of patients with known sarcoidosis with suspected cardiac involvement who underwent cardiac MRI with LGE with at least 12 months of either prospective or retrospective follow-up data regarding post-MRI adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We identified 7 studies of 694 subjects (mean age 53; 42% men).One hundred and ninety-nine patients (29%) were LGE positive. All-cause mortality occurred in 19 LGE-positive versus 17 LGE-negative subjects (annualized incidence, 3.1% versus 0.6%). The pooled relative risk was 3.38 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-10.7; P=0.04). Cardiovascular mortality occurred in 10 LGE-positive versus 2 LGE-negative subjects (annualized incidence, 1.9% versus 0.3%; relative risk 10.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.34-86.3]; P=0.03). Ventricular arrhythmia occurred in 41 LGE-positive versus 0 LGE-negative subjects (annualized incidence, 5.9% versus 0%; relative risk 19.5 [95% confidence interval, 2.68-143]; P=0.003). A combined end point of death or ventricular arrhythmia occurred in 64 LGE-positive versus 18 LGE-negative subjects (annualized incidence, 8.8% versus 0.6%; relative risk 6.20 [95% confidence interval, 2.47-15.6]; P<0.001).

We aimed to investigate the association of subclinical atherosclerosis and migraine with or without aura compared to a non-migraine subgroup (reference) in a large Brazilian multicentric cohort study, the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). Methods Migraine diagnostic was based on International Headache Society criteria, and aura symptoms were validated by a medical doctor in a sub-sample of the ELSA-Brasil, who also underwent coronary artery calcium score (CAC) and carotid intima-media thickness (C-IMT) evaluations. Subclinical atherosclerosis indexes (CAC and C-IMT) were analyzed as dependent variables and migraine (all, with aura, without aura) as an independent variable in the linear and multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for possible confounders. Results Of 3217 ELSA participants free from CVD at baseline, we found a migraine frequency of 11.9% (5.1% with aura and 6.8% without aura). Overall, migraineurs were mostly women, younger and had lower frequency of CV risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and low HDL-cholesterol, compared to non-migraineurs. The strongest inverse correlation between migraine and subclinical atherosclerosis was verified with CAC score. However, all associations lost their significance after multivariate adjustment. Conclusions In this cross-sectional evaluation of the ELSA study, migraine was not associated with subclinical atherosclerosis, regardless of aura symptoms. © International Headache Society.",Migraine with aura; observational study; subclinical atherosclerosis,adult; arterial wall thickness; Brazil; coronary artery disease; cross-sectional study; female; human; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; Migraine Disorders; Adult; Brazil; Carotid Intima-Media Thickness; Coronary Artery Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Migraine Disorders
Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,Association between non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis and hyper reactive blood pressure response on the exercise treadmill test,2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011093315&doi=10.1093%2fqjmed%2fhcw003&partnerID=40&md5=573fd5f78ce147c2b7668ce6dd52c627,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Aims: Non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis (HS) is associated with hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk. While Blood pressure hyper-reactive response (HRR) during peak exercise indicates an increased risk of incident hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk, no data on the association of non-alcoholic HS and HRR exists. In this study, we have evaluated the association of HS with HRR. Methods: We included 13 410 consecutive individuals with a mean age: 42.4 6 8.9 years, 3561 (26.6%) female with normal resting blood pressure and without a previous diagnosis of hypertension, who underwent symptom limited exercise treadmill test, abdominal ultrasonography and clinical and laboratory evaluation. HS was detected by abdominal ultrasonography. HRR was defined by a peak exercise systolic blood pressure > 220mmHg and/or elevation of 15mmHg or more in diastolic blood pressure from rest to peak exercise. Results: The prevalence of HS was 29.5% (n = 3956). Overall, 4.6% (n = 619) of the study population presented a HRR. Subjects with HS had a higher prevalence of HRR (8.1 vs. 3.1%, odds ratio 2.8, 95% CI 2.4-3.3, P < 0.001). After adjustment for body mass index, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, HS (odds ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.6, P = 0.002) remained independently associated with HRR. HS was additive to obesity markers in predicting exercise HRR. Conclusions: Non-alcoholic HS is independently associated with hyper-reactive exercise blood pressure response. © The Author 2016.",,adult; Article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; disease association; echography; female; human; hypertension; laboratory test; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nonalcoholic fatty liver; obesity; priority journal; prospective study; treadmill exercise; treadmill test
Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,European society of cardiology-recommended coronary artery disease consortium pretest probability scores more accurately predict obstructive coronary disease and cardiovascular events than the diamond and forrester score,2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978720966&doi=10.1161%2fCIRCULATIONAHA.116.023396&partnerID=40&md5=fd02783f2b756fe5ff6622c6e60e1678,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Background: The most appropriate score for evaluating the pretest probability of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is unknown. We sought to compare the Diamond-Forrester (DF) score with the 2 CAD consortium scores recently recommended by the European Society of Cardiology. Methods: We included 2274 consecutive patients (age, 56±13 years; 57% male) without prior CAD referred for coronary computed tomographic angiography. Computed tomographic angiography findings were used to determine the presence or absence of obstructive CAD (≥50% stenosis). We compared the DF score with the 2 CAD consortium scores with respect to their ability to predict obstructive CAD and the potential implications of these scores on the downstream use of testing for CAD, as recommended by current guidelines. Results: The DF score did not satisfactorily fit the data and resulted in a significant overestimation of the prevalence of obstructive CAD (P<0.001); the CAD consortium basic score had no significant lack of fitness; and the CAD consortium clinical provided adequate goodness of fit (P=0.39). The DF score had a lower discrimination for obstructive CAD, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0.713 versus 0.752 and 0.791 for the CAD consortium models (P<0.001 for both). Consequently, the use of the DF score was associated with fewer individuals being categorized as requiring no additional testing (8.3%) compared with the CAD consortium models (24.6% and 30.0%; P<0.001). The proportion of individuals with a high pretest probability was 18% with the DF and only 1.1% with the CAD consortium scores (P<0.001) Conclusions: Among contemporary patients referred for noninvasive testing, the DF risk score overestimates the risk of obstructive CAD. On the other hand, the CAD consortium scores offered improved goodness of fit and discrimination; thus, their use could decrease the need for noninvasive or invasive testing while increasing the yield of such tests. © 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.",chest pain; coronary artery disease; prognosis; risk assessment,"adult; Article; cardiovascular disease assessment; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; computed tomographic angiography; Coronary Artery Disease Consortium Pretest Probability score; coronary artery obstruction; Diamond Forrester score; Europe; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; medical society; middle aged; practice guideline; predictive value; Pretest Probability score; prevalence; priority journal; unstable angina pectoris; aged; area under the curve; cardiology; Coronary Disease; diagnostic imaging; heart function test; receiver operating characteristic; register; risk assessment; severity of illness index; spiral computer assisted tomography; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Area Under Curve; Cardiology; Coronary Disease; Heart Function Tests; Humans; Middle Aged; Registries; Risk Assessment; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index; Societies, Medical; Tomography, Spiral Computed; Treatment Outcome"

Our aim was to investigate whether psychopathological symptoms were associated with CAC in a cross-sectional analysis of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) baseline. We analyzed data from 4,279 ELSA-Brasil subjects (aged 35 to 74 years) from the São Paulo site without previous cardiovascular disease who underwent CAC score assessment at baseline. Prevalent CAC was defined as a CAC score >0. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R). We built binary logistic regression models to determine whether CIS-R scores, anxiety, or depression were associated with prevalent CAC. Prevalent CAC was found in 1,211 subjects (28.3%). After adjustment for age and gender, a direct association between CIS-R scores and prevalent CAC was revealed (odds ratio for 1-SD increase: 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.22). This association persisted after multivariate adjustment (odds ratio for 1-SD increase 1.11; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.20). No independent associations were found for specific diagnoses of anxiety or depression and prevalent CAC. In post hoc models, a significant interaction term (p = 0.019) suggested a stronger association in older subjects. In conclusion, psychopathological symptoms were directly associated with coronary atherosclerosis in the ELSA-Brasil baseline in adjusted models, and this association seems to be stronger in older subjects. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,"calcium; adult; age distribution; anxiety; Article; blood pressure; cohort analysis; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery calcium score; cross-sectional study; depression; diabetes mellitus; disease association; dyslipidemia; female; follow up; generalized anxiety disorder; human; hypertension; income; major clinical study; major depression; male; mental disease; middle aged; multicenter study; priority journal; sex difference; smoking; aged; anxiety; Brazil; calcinosis; coronary artery disease; coronary blood vessel; depression; diagnostic imaging; longitudinal study; odds ratio; statistical model; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Brazil; Calcinosis; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Vessels; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

Although the population distribution of CAC has been determined for several White populations, the distribution in ethnically admixed groups has not been well established. Hypothesis: The CAC distribution, stratified for age, gender and race, is similar to the previously described distribution in the MESA study. Methods: The Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) is a prospective cohort study designed to investigate subclinical cardiovascular disease in 6 different centers of Brazil. Similar to previous studies, individuals with self-reported coronary or cerebrovascular disease and those treated for diabetes mellitus were excluded from analysis. Results: Percentiles of CAC distribution were estimated with nonparametric techniques. The analysis included 3616 individuals (54% female; mean age, 50 years). As expected, CAC prevalence and burden were steadily higher with increasing age, as well as increased in men and in White individuals. Our results revealed that for a given CAC score, the ELSA-derived CAC percentile would be lower in men compared with the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and would be higher in women compared with MESA. Conclusions: In our sample of the Brazilian population, we observed significant differences in CAC by sex, age, and race. Adjusted for age and sex, low-risk individuals from the Brazilian population present with significantly lower CAC prevalence and burden compared with other low-risk individuals from other worldwide populations. Using US-derived percentiles in Brazilian individuals may lead to overestimating relative CAC burden in men and underestimating relative CAC burden in women. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,

Therefore, the development and evolution of this CMP has always been a major topic in numbers of previous studies. A comprehensive echocardiographic study of left ventricular (LV) mechanics, fully assessing myocardial contraction, has never been done before. This could help characterize and improve the understanding of the evolution of this prevalent CMP. Methods: A total of 47 chagasic and 84 control patients were included in this study and allocated in groups according to LV ejection fraction. 2D-Echocardiogram was acquired for LV mechanics analysis by speckle tracking echocardiography. Results: Mean age of chagasic individuals was 55y and 16 (34 %) were men. Significant difference was found in global longitudinal velocity analysis, with lower values in indeterminate form. In the group with severe systolic dysfunction, a paradoxical increase in longitudinal and apical radial displacements were demonstrated. In parallel, segmental analyzes highlighted lower values of radial displacement, strain and strain rate into inferior and inferolateral walls, with increase of these values in septal and anterior walls. Conclusion: Chagasic CMP has a vicarious pattern of contraction in the course of its evolution, defined by reduced displacement and strain into inferior and posterior walls with paradoxical increase in septal and anterior segments. Also, lower longitudinal velocities were demonstrated in CD indeterminate form, which may indicate an incipient myocardial injury. © 2016 Lima et al.",Cardiac mechanics; Cardiomyopathies; Speckle tracking echocardiography; Strain,"adult; Article; Chagas disease; controlled study; female; heart left ventricle contraction; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; left ventricular systolic dysfunction; major clinical study; male; prospective study; radiological parameters; region of interest; speckle tracking echocardiography; two dimensional echocardiography; Chagas cardiomyopathy; diagnostic imaging; echocardiography; follow up; heart left ventricle function; heart ventricle; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; prognosis; randomized controlled trial; Adult; Chagas Cardiomyopathy; Echocardiography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Ventricular Function, Left"

The present study adopts a modern path modelling approach to understand potential causal pathways that may underpin this relationship. Methods: Here we examine the association between resting-state HF-HRV and executive function in a large sample of civil servants from Brazil (N = 8114) recruited for the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). HF-HRV was calculated from 10-min resting-state electrocardiograms. Executive function was assessed using the trail-making test (version B). Results and conclusions: Insulin resistance (a marker of type 2 diabetes mellitus) and carotid intima-media thickness (subclinical atherosclerosis) mediated the relationship between HRV and executive function in seriatim. A limitation of the present study is its cross-sectional design; therefore, conclusions must be confirmed in longitudinal study. Nevertheless, findings support that possibility that HRV provides a 'spark' that initiates a cascade of adverse downstream effects that subsequently leads to cognitive impairment. © 2016.",Carotid intima-media thickness; Cognition; Executive function; Heart rate variability; HOMA-IR; Homeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance; HRV; IMT; Mediation analyses; Path modelling; TMT; Trail making test,adult; aged; arterial wall thickness; Article; Brazilian; cross-sectional study; executive function; female; heart rate variability; human; human experiment; insulin resistance; male; normal human; priority journal; trail making test

In this study, we have performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the use of coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) with usual care. Methods and Results-We systematically searched databases for randomized clinical trials comparing coronary CTA with usual care for the evaluation of stable chest pain with follow-up for cardiovascular outcomes. The primary outcomes were myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality. We identified 4 randomized clinical trials, including a total of 7403 patients undergoing coronary CTA and 7414 patients undergoing usual care with various functional testing approaches. When compared with usual care, the use of coronary CTA was associated with a significant reduction in the annual rate of myocardial infarction (rate ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.98; P=0.038), but no difference was found in all-cause mortality. There was a trend toward more invasive coronary angiographies among patients undergoing coronary CTA (odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.84; P=0.09) and higher use of coronary revascularizations (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.75). Significant heterogeneity for invasive coronary angiography and revascularization was noted, which was attributable to the Scottish Computed Tomography of the HEART (SCOT-HEART) study. We found no difference in the rate of admission for cardiac chest pain (rate ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.54). Conclusions-In comparison to usual care, an initial investigation of suspected stable coronary artery disease using coronary CTA resulted in a significant reduction in myocardial infarction, an increased incidence of coronary revascularization, and no effect in all-cause mortality. Future studies should further define whether the potential reduction in myocardial infarction identified justifies the increased resource utilization associated with coronary CTA. © 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.",Angina; chest pain; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; myocardial infarction; stable,"computer assisted tomography; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; human; meta analysis; mortality; radiography; randomized controlled trial (topic); thorax pain; Chest Pain; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

Methods We included 4,077 participants with no prior history of cardiovascular disease aged 35 to 74 years who underwent CAC measurement. The 2010 Task Force of the American Heart Association cutoffs were used to define the ideal level of smoking, physical activity, diet, blood pressure, glucose/cholesterol levels, and body mass index. Results Participants were categorized according the number of IRF: 0 to 1 (n = 1,025, 25.1%), 2 (n = 1,200, 29.4%), 3 to 4 (n = 1,551, 38.1%), or 5 to 7 (n = 301, 7.4%). Compared to individuals with 0 to 1 IRF, the odds ratio of participants with 2 IRFs presenting with CAC >0 (compared to 0), ≥100 (compared to <100), and ≥400 (compared to <400) was 0.75 (95% CI 0.62-0.91), 0.64 (0.49-0.84), and 0.75 (0.49-1.15), respectively. Similarly, the odds ratios of CACs >0, ≥100, and ≥400 in individuals with 3 to 4 IRFs were 0.59 (95% CI 0.48-0.71), 0.46 (0.34-0.62), and 0.50 (0.30-0.83), respectively, and, for individuals with 5 to 7 IRFs, were 0.36 (95% CI 0.24-0.56), 0.22 (0.09-0.55), and 0.20 (0.03-1.45), respectively. Conclusions Subjects with an IRF profile have lower CAC when compared to subjects with fewer controlled risk factors. However, even among individuals with 5 to 7 IRFs, it is possible to find a CAC higher than zero reflecting that measures of IRF do not fully account for all factors that resulted in coronary artery disease. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Several anatomical scores have been developed as surrogates for overall atherosclerotic burden in coronary CTA and even proven to be highly predictive for future adverse events. However, they have not been validated against the gold standard for atherosclerotic burden, intra-vascular ultrasound (IVUS). In the present study we have compared several coronary CTA scores with the coronary IVUS. Methods and results: A total of 62 patients with diagnosed coronary disease scheduled for percutaneous intervention were prospectively enrolled. For all patients, coronary CTA and multivessel IVUS were obtained. Calcium score and 6 previously reported scores were calculated from coronary CTA imaging and compared to average IVUS-derived percent atheroma volume (PAV). On average, 3.8 ± 0.7 vessels, comprising 123.8 ± 31.3 mm in length, were imaged with IVUS per patient. All but one previously described scoring systems showed a significant association with IVUS-derived PAV. Among them, the SSS score demonstrated the strongest correlation with IVUS-PAV (r = 0.61, p < 0.001) and the greatest area under the ROC curve (C-statistic = 0.87), to predict a high PAV. Conclusions: Most frequently used coronary CTA scores have a good correlation with global coronary atherosclerotic burden measured by multivessel IVUS derived atheroma volume. Among them, the SSS score shows the best performance being a good non-invasive alternative to IVUS for global coronary atherosclerotic burden assessment. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Atherosclerosis; Computed tomography; Coronary disease; Intravascular ultrasound,"glyceryl trinitrate; adult; angiocardiography; angiography device; area under the curve; Article; atheroma; cardiovascular disease assessment; comparative study; computed tomographic angiography; computed tomography scanner; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery calcium score; coronary artery disease; correlation analysis; female; Friesinger score; Gensini score; high risk population; human; intravascular ultrasound; intravascular ultrasound catheter; Leaman score; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multidetector computed tomography; percutaneous coronary intervention; priority journal; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; secondary prevention; aged; atherosclerotic plaque; blood vessel calcification; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; coronary blood vessel; diagnostic imaging; interventional ultrasonography; predictive value; procedures; reproducibility; severity of illness index; validation study; Aged; Area Under Curve; Computed Tomography Angiography; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Vessels; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index; Ultrasonography, Interventional; Vascular Calcification"

However, the impact of those recommendations in other populations is limited. In the present study, we evaluated the potential implications of those recommendations in the Brazilian population. Hypothesis The new U.S. recommendations may increase the proportion of individuals who are candidates for statin therapy. Methods We included all participants of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) without known cardiovascular disease. We calculated the indication for statin therapy according to the current Brazilian recommendations and the new US guidelines, using both the 5.0% and the 7.5% risk cutoffs to recommend treatment, and compared their impact in the Brazilian population stratified by age, sex, and race. Results Although the current guidelines would recommend treatment for 5499 (39.1%) individuals, the number of individuals eligible for statin therapy increased to 6014 (42.7%) and to 7130 (50.7%) using the 7.5% and 5% cutoffs, respectively (P < 0.001). This difference is more pronounced for older individuals, and virtually all individuals age >70 years would be eligible for statins, whereas the new guidelines would reduce the number of candidates for statin therapy in individuals age <45 years. Conclusions The application of the new US guidelines for the use of lipid-lowering medications in a large middle-aged Brazilian cohort would result in a significant increase in the population eligible for statins.

Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,Use of imaging and clinical data to screen for cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic diabetics,2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957542996&doi=10.1186%2fs12933-016-0334-4&partnerID=40&md5=8738dc472ca8b6224e898b1d35c6d655,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Background: There is increasing evidence to suggest that not all individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have equal risk for developing cardiovascular disease. We sought to compare the yield of testing for pre-clinical atherosclerosis with various approaches. Methods: 98 asymptomatic individuals with T2DM without known coronary artery disease (CAD) were enrolled in a prospective study and underwent carotid ultrasound, exercise treadmill testing (ETT), coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring, and coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). Results: Of 98 subjects (average age 55 ± 6, 64 % female), 43 (44 %) had coronary plaque detectable on CTA, and 38 (39 %) had CAC score >0. By CTA, 16 (16 %) had coronary stenosis ≥50 %, including three subjects with CAC = 0. Subjects with coronary plaque had greater prevalence of carotid plaque (58 % vs. 38 %, p= 0.01) and greater carotid intima media thickness (0.80 ± 0.20 mm vs. 0.70 ± 0.11 mm, p = 0.02). Notably, 18 of 55 subjects (33 %) with normal CTA had carotid plaque. Eight subjects had a positive ETT, of whom five had ≥ 50 % coronary stenosis, two had <50 % stenosis, and one had no CAD. Among these tests, CAC scoring had the highest sensitivity and specificity for prediction of CAD. Conclusion: Among asymptomatic subjects with T2DM, a majority (56 %) had no CAD by CTA. When compared to CTA, CAC was the most accurate screening modality for detection of CAD, while ETT and carotid ultrasound were less sensitive and specific. However, 33 % of subjects with normal coronary CTA had carotid plaque, suggesting that screening for carotid plaque might better characterize stroke risk in such patients. © 2016 Rassi et al.",Coronary artery disease; Coronary computed tomography angiography; Type 2 diabetes mellitus,"adult; angiocardiography; arterial wall thickness; Article; asymptomatic disease; atherosclerotic plaque; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; coronary artery calcium score; coronary artery disease; coronary artery obstruction; coronary computed tomography angiography; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease association; echography; female; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; prevalence; prospective study; sensitivity and specificity; treadmill test; aged; arterial wall thickness; asymptomatic disease; atherosclerotic plaque; Brazil; Carotid Artery Diseases; comparative study; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; coronary blood vessel; Coronary Stenosis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; diagnostic imaging; exercise test; mass screening; middle aged; pathophysiology; predictive value; procedures; prognosis; reproducibility; Vascular Calcification; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Asymptomatic Diseases; Brazil; Carotid Artery Diseases; Carotid Intima-Media Thickness; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Stenosis; Coronary Vessels; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diagnostic Imaging; Exercise Test; Female; Humans; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Predictive Value of Tests; Prevalence; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Vascular Calcification"

Methods: A sample of 984 individuals from ELSA-Brasil (35-54 years) without cardiovascular disease or diabetes was stratified according to E-selectin tertiles. Traditional risk factors, inflammatory markers and categories of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores were evaluated across the tertiles by ANOVA or Chi-squared test. In linear regression models, associations of E-selectin levels with insulin resistance index, adjusted for age, sex and adiposity were tested. Results: The mean age of the participants was 45.8 (SD 4.9) years and 55 % were women. Mean values of age, anthropometric data, biochemical variables and inflammatory status increased across E-selectin tertiles. Also, a gradual deterioration of the cardiometabolic profile was reflected by increments in frequencies (95 % CI) of BMI ≥ 25 kg/ m2 [53.7 % (48.5-58.8), 61.0 % (56.1-66.5) and 64.2 % (59.0-69.4), p = 0.019], hypertension [18.0 % (14.1-22.8), 19.8 % (15.4-24.6) and 24.8 % (20.4-29.9), p = 0.048], pre-diabetes [62.5 % (57.4-68.3), 63.1 % (58.4-69.6) and 73.8 % (68.8- 78.3), p = 0.003] and hypertriglyceridemia [22.4 % (17.9-27.2), 27.3 % (22.5-32.8) and 33.4 % (28.3-38.5), p = 0.013]. Insulinemia and HOMA-IR were independently associated with E-selectin concentration. A greater proportion of individuals with CAC scores different from zero was found in the third tertile when compared with the first and second tertiles (16.1 versus 11 %, p = 0.04, respectively). Conclusions: Direct associations of E-selectin with traditional risk factors slightly above their normal ranges, components of the metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and presence of CAC suggest that this biomarker may indicate an initial atherogenic process. © 2016 de Almeida-Pititto et al.",Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular risk factors; E-selectin; Endothelial dysfunction; Insulin resistance,

Cardiac involvement-which is associated with worse prognosis-has been detected in approximately 25% of individuals based on autopsy or cardiac imaging studies. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis is challenging due to the low yield of endomyocardial biopsy, and the limited accuracy of various clinical criteria. Thus, no gold standard diagnostic criterion exists. This review will summarize the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis with a focus on advanced cardiovascular imaging, We review the evidence to support a role for cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in the initial evaluation of selected patients with suspected cardiac sarcoidosis, with cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) as an alternative or complementary initial diagnostic test in a subgroup of patients in whom CMR may be contra-indicated or when CMR is negative with continued clinical concern for myocardial inflammation. In addition to the diagnostic value of these tests, CMR and PET are also useful in identifying patients who have higher risk of adverse events such as ventricular tachycardia or death, in whom preventive therapies such as defibrillators should be more strongly considered. Although no randomized controlled trials for treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis exist, immunosuppressive therapy is often used. We review emerging evidence regarding the use of cardiac PET to identify and quantity the amount of myocardial inflammation as well as to guide the use of immunotherapy. Future studies are needed to determine the benefit of imaging guided therapies aimed at improving patient outcomes.",Cardiac MRI; Cardiac positron emission tomography (cardiac PET); Cardiac sarcoidosis; Review,

However, the results of the association between CIMT and cognitive function in middle-aged subjects are mixed. We aimed to investigate this association in a large Brazilian sample with no history of stroke at baseline. Additionally, we tested the effect of interactions between CIMT and cardiovascular risk factors on cognitive performance. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, cognition was evaluated using the delayed word recall (DWRT), the category fluency, and the trail making tests (TMT). CIMT was measured at the common carotid artery. The association between CIMT and cognitive tests was investigated using linear regression models, adjusted for an extensive set of possible confounding variables. We also included interaction terms with selected risk factors. Results: The mean age of the 8208 participants was 49.6 ± 7.3 years, 44% were male, and 56% White. Increase in CIMT was associated with worse performance on the DWRT (β = -0.433, 95%CI = -0.724;-0.142, p = 0.004). We found effect modification of the association between cognitive function and CMIT by self-reported heart failure and alcohol intake. Participants had worse performance in the TMT if they had greater CIMT and current alcohol use (p < 0.0001). The interaction between CIMT and heart failure on TMT performance was not significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons (p = 0.07). Conclusions: In this sample of middle-aged adults, CIMT was inversely associated with memory function. Additionally, the presence of alcohol use resulted in a stronger association of CIMT with worse performance on an executive function test. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Atherosclerosis; Carotid intima media thickness; Cognition disorders,"adult; alcohol consumption; arterial wall thickness; Article; Brazilian; cardiovascular risk; carotid artery; carotid atherosclerosis; cerebrovascular accident; cognition; cognition assessment; common carotid artery; delayed word recall test; executive function test; female; heart failure; human; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; memory; middle aged; priority journal; self report; trail making test; adverse effects; asymptomatic disease; atherosclerotic plaque; Brazil; carotid artery disease; clinical trial; Cognition Disorders; common carotid artery; complication; cross-sectional study; drinking behavior; echography; executive function; multicenter study; multivariate analysis; predictive value; psychology; recall; risk factor; statistical model; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Asymptomatic Diseases; Brazil; Carotid Artery Diseases; Carotid Artery, Common; Carotid Intima-Media Thickness; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Cross-Sectional Studies; Executive Function; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Mental Recall; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Trail Making Test"

The aim of the present study was to assess the role of NRBCs as a predictor of intensive care unit (ICU) and in hospital all-cause mortality among cardiologic patients. Methods NRBCs were measured daily in consecutive cardiac ICU patients, including individuals with both coronary and non-coronary acute cardiac care.We excluded patients younger than 18 years, with cancer or hematological disease, on glucocorticoid therapy, those that were readmitted after hospital discharge and patients who died in the first 24 hours after admission. We performed a multiple logistic analysis to identify independent predictors of mortality. Results We included 152 patients (60.6 ± 16.8 years, 51.8%female, median ICU stay of 7 [4-11] days). The prevalence of NRBCs was 54.6%(83/152). The presence of NRBC was associated with a higher ICU mortality (49.4% vs 21.7%, P<0.001) as well as in-hospital mortality (61.4% vs 33.3%, p = 0.001). NRBC were equally associated with mortality among coronary disease (64.71% vs 32.5%[OR 3.80; 95%CI: 1.45-10.0; p = 0.007]) and non-coronary disease patients (61.45% vs 33.3% [OR 3.19; 95%CI: 1.63-6.21; p<0.001]). In a multivariable model, the inclusion of NRBC to the APACHE II score resulted in a significant improvement in the discrimination (p = 0.01). Conclusions NRBC are predictors of all-cause in-hospital mortality in patients admitted to a cardiac ICU. This predictive value is independent and complementary to the well validated APACHE II score. ©2015 Monteiro Júnior et al.

While some studies suggest statins may reduce plaque volume, the reduction is small even with the use of high-dose statins. Due to this small change in plaque volume, other effects of statin therapy on plaques have been proposed. A large meta-analysis by Banach et al. explored statin effects on plaque composition detected by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). We discuss the mechanisms of plaque composition modification demonstrated in their study and its implications on atherosclerotic plaque stabilization. © 2015 Bittencourt and Cerci.",,"hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; atherosclerotic plaque; computed tomographic angiography; coronary artery calcification; correlational study; disease course; dose response; drug response; human; in vitro study; intravascular ultrasound; meta analysis (topic); Note; atherosclerotic plaque; coronary artery disease; diagnostic imaging; echography; Coronary Artery Disease; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Ultrasonography"

Here we evaluated the interplay between CKD and CAD in predicting CV death or myocardial infarction (MI) and all-cause death. We included 1541 consecutive patients in the Partners registry (mean age 55 years, 43% female) over 18 years old with no known prior CAD who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). The results of CCTA were categorized as normal, nonobstructive (under half), or obstructive (half and over). Overall, 653 of the patients had no CAD, 583 had nonobstructive CAD, and 305 had obstructive CAD, while 1299 had eGFR over 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and 242 had an eGFR under this value. The presence and severity of CAD was significantly associated with an increased rate of CV death or MI and all-cause death, even after adjustment for age, gender, symptoms, and risk factors. Similarly, reduced eGFR was significantly associated with CV death or MI and all-cause death after similar adjustment. The addition of reduced GFR to a model which included both clinical variables and CCTA findings resulted in significant improvement in the prediction of CV death or MI and all-cause death. Thus, among individuals referred for CCTA to evaluate CAD, renal dysfunction is associated with an increased rate of CV events, mainly driven by an increase in the rate of noncoronary CV events. In this group of patients, both eGFR and the presence and severity of CAD together improve the prediction of future CV events and death.",Cardiovascular disease; Chronic kidney disease; Coronary artery disease; Coronary computed tomography; Prognosis,"adult; age distribution; angiocardiography; Article; cardiovascular risk; cause of death; computed tomographic angiography; controlled study; coronary artery disease; coronary computed tomography angiography; disease association; disease classification; disease registry; disease severity; female; glomerulus filtration rate; heart infarction; human; kidney dysfunction; major clinical study; male; middle aged; patient referral; prediction; priority journal; prognosis; sex ratio; symptomatology; aged; cardiovascular disease; chronic kidney failure; complication; computer assisted tomography; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; incidence; mortality; Myocardial Infarction; pathophysiology; predictive value; radiography; severity of illness index; Adult; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cause of Death; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Disease; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Predictive Value of Tests; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Severity of Illness Index; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

Objectives: To describe one-year case-fatality rates in the Strategy of Registry of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ERICO) cohort, and to study baseline characteristics as predictors. Methods: We analyzed data from 964 ERICO participants enrolled from February 2009 to December 2012. We assessed vital status by telephone contact and official death certificate searches. The cause of death was determined according to the official death certificates. We used log-rank tests to compare the probabilities of survival across subgroups. We built crude and adjusted (for age, sex and ACS subtype) Cox regression models to study if the ACS subtype or baseline characteristics were independent predictors of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Results: We identified 110 deaths in the cohort (case-fatality rate, 12.0%). Age [Hazard ratio (HR) = 2.04 per 10 year increase; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.75–2.38], non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (HR = 3.82; 95% CI = 2.21–6.60) or ST elevation myocardial infarction (HR = 2.59; 95% CI = 1.38–4.89) diagnoses, and diabetes (HR = 1.78; 95% CI = 1.20-2.63) were significant risk factors for all-cause mortality in the adjusted models. We found similar results for cardiovascular mortality. A previous coronary artery disease diagnosis was also an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.04–2.50), but not for cardiovascular mortality. Conclusions: We found an overall one-year mortality rate of 12.0% in a sample of post-ACS patients in a community, non-specialized hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. Age, ACS subtype, and diabetes were independent predictors of poor one-year survival for overall and cardiovascular-related causes. © 2015, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

Objective: The aim of our study is to perform meta-analysis of the results obtained from studies on extracorporeal venous ultrafiltration and compare them with those of standard diuretic treatment for overload volume reduction in acute decompensated heart failure. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were systematically searched using a pre-specified criterion. Pooled estimates of outcomes after 48 h (weight change, serum creatinine level, and all-cause mortality) were computed using random effect models. Pooled weighted mean differences were calculated for weight loss and change in creatinine level, whereas a pooled risk ratio was used for the analysis of binary all-cause mortality outcome. Results: A total of nine studies, involving 613 patients, met the eligibility criteria. The mean weight loss in patients who underwent UF therapy was 1.78 kg [95% Confidence Interval (CI): -2.65 to -0.91 kg; p < 0.001) more than those who received standard diuretic therapy. The post-intervention creatinine level, however, was not significantly different (mean change = -0.25 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.56 to 0.06 mg/dL; p = 0.112). The risk of all-cause mortality persisted in patients treated with UF compared with patients treated with standard diuretics (Pooled RR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.64–1.56; p = 0.993). Conclusion: Compared with standard diuretic therapy, UF treatment for overload volume reduction in individuals suffering from ADHF, resulted in significant reduction of body weight within 48 h.

Methods and results We studied 582 patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD) who were clinically referred for ETT and CTA within 6 months. Patientswere followed for cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), or late revascularization (>90 days), stratified by Duke Treadmill Score (DTS) and CAD severity (≥50% stenosis). Mean age was 54±13 years (63% male). In median follow-up of 40 months, therewere 3 CV deaths, 7 non-fatal MIs, and 26 late revascularizations. ETTwas inconclusive in 23%, positive in 31%, and negative in 46%.CTAdemonstrated noCADin 37%, nonobstructive CADin 28%, and obstructive CADin 35%. Among low-risk ETT patients (n = 326), therewere 3 MI, 10 late revascularizations, and the frequent presence of non-obstructive (32%, n = 105) and obstructive CAD (27%, n = 88). When present, ETT features (i.e. angina, DTS, ischaemic electrocardiogram changes, and exercise capacity) individually failed to predict CV death/MI after adjustment for Morise score. Conversely, both obstructive CAD [HR 4.9 (1.0.23.3), P = 0.048] and CAD extent by segment involvement score >4 [HR 3.9 (1.0.15.2), P = 0.049] predicted increased risk for CV death or MI. Conclusion Patients with a low-risk ETT have an excellent prognosis at 40 months, despite the frequent presence of non-obstructive (32%) and obstructive (27%) CAD. In patients with an intermediate-to high-risk ETT (DTS <5), CTA can provide incremental risk stratification for future CV events. © 2015 The Author.",Coronary artery disease; Coronary computed tomographic angiography; Exercise testing; Major adverse cardiac events; Prognosis,"adult; angiocardiography; Article; assessment of humans; cardiovascular mortality; clinical feature; computed tomographic angiography; coronary artery disease; coronary computed tomographic angiography; disease severity; Duke Treadmill Score; electrocardiogram; exercise treadmill testing; female; follow up; heart infarction; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; patient risk; priority journal; treadmill exercise; treadmill test; comparative study; coronary angiography; diagnostic imaging; epidemiology; exercise test; Massachusetts; middle aged; mortality; pathophysiology; prognosis; register; risk assessment; risk factor; survival analysis; x-ray computed tomography; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Disease; Exercise Test; Female; Humans; Male; Massachusetts; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Registries; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Survival Analysis; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

Objective: Analyze the association between psoriasis and subclinical atherosclerosis using coronary calcium score (CAC). Methods: We investigated 221 participants with psoriasis and 718 age- and sex-matched controls without prior known CAD. All participants completed a questionnaire and underwent laboratory tests and a CAC exam. Logistic regression models adjusted for Framingham risk score (FRS) and C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were built. CAC was included in the models as a binary variable with different cut off values. Results: Body-mass index, race, hypertension, HDL, LDL and hs-CRP were significantly associated with psoriasis presence and severity. Psoriasis severity was significantly associated with CAC (p=0.04), particularly for very high CAC (>400) (p<0.01). The OR for severe psoriasis and CAC >400 was 2.45 (95%CI: 1.26-4.75) in unadjusted models. In a model adjusted for the FRS, this association was no longer significant, but a trend was noted (p=0.09). No significant changes in the association were noted after the inclusion of hs-CRP in the model. Conclusion: Psoriasis is associated with higher CAC values, mainly in individuals with severe psoriasis. The current findings also suggest the potential involvement of other mechanisms beyond classical cardiovascular risk factors and inflammation in this association. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Cardiovascular disease; Cardiovascular risk factors; Coronary artery calcium; Psoriasis; Subclinical atherosclerosis,C reactive protein; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; adult; Article; atherosclerosis; body mass; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; coronary artery calcium score; coronary artery disease; cross-sectional study; disease association; disease severity; female; Framingham risk score; human; hypertension; laboratory test; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; psoriasis; questionnaire

Most IMT studies have involved populations with low rates of racial blending. The aim of the present article is to describe IMT value distributions and analyze the influence of sex and race on IMT values in a large Brazilian sample, a setting with a high rate of racial admixture. Methods: The Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) is a multicenter cohort of 15,105 adult (aged 35-74 years) civil servants in six Brazilian cities. Baseline assessment included IMT measurements in both common carotid arteries. Race was self-reported. We studied the association between sex and race with IMT values using multiple linear regression models. We conducted analyses in all and low-risk individuals, defined as those without classical cardiovascular risk factors. Results: We analyzed complete IMT data from 10,405 ELSA-Brasil participants. We present nomograms by age for all and low-risk individuals, stratified by sex and race. We found that men had significantly higher maximal IMT values compared with women (. β=0.058; P<0.001). This association remained for low-risk individuals (. β=0.027; P=0.001). In addition, Brown and White individuals had lower maximal IMT values compared with Black individuals for all (. β=-0.034 and β=-0.054, respectively;. P<0.001) and low-risk individuals (. β=-0.027; P=0.013 and β=-0.035; P<0.001, respectively). Conclusion: We found significantly higher IMT values in men. We found significantly higher IMT values in Black individuals than White and Brown individuals.

Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,Comparison of the use of downstream tests after exercise treadmill testing by cardiologists versus noncardiologists,2014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903161779&doi=10.1016%2fj.amjcard.2014.04.040&partnerID=40&md5=6ef41a906688a2358f44bbf2e0859b83,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Although exercise treadmill testing (ETT) is a useful initial test for patients with suspected cardiovascular (CV) disease, there is concern regarding the use of downstream imaging tests especially in the setting of equivocal or positive ETTs. Patients with no history of coronary artery disease who underwent ETT between 2009 and 2010 were prospectively included. Referring physicians were categorized as cardiologists and noncardiologists. Downstream tests included nuclear perfusion imaging, coronary computed tomography angiography, stress echocardiography, stress magnetic resonance, and invasive coronary angiography performed up to 6 months after the ETT. Patients were followed for CV death, myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization for a median of 2.7 years. Among 3,656 patients, the ETT were negative in 2,876 (79%), positive in 132 (3.6%), and inconclusive in 643 (18%). Cardiologists ordered less downstream tests than noncardiologists (9.5% vs 12.2%, p = 0.02), with less noninvasive tests (5.9% vs 10.4%, p <0.0001) and more invasive angiography (3.6% vs 1.8%, p <0.0001). After adjustment for confounding, patients evaluated by cardiologists were less likely to undergo additional testing after equivocal (odds ratio: 0.65, p = 0.02) or positive ETT results (odds ratio: 0.39, p = 0.02), whereas after negative ETT, the odds ratio was 1.7 (p = 0.06). There was no difference in the rate of adverse CV events between patients referred by cardiologists versus noncardiologists. In conclusion, patients referred for ETT by cardiologists are less likely to undergo additional testing, particularly noninvasive tests, than those referred by noncardiologists. The lower rate of tests is driven by a lower rate of tests after positive or inconclusive ETT. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Background The utility of additional diagnostic testing after ETT is not well characterized. Methods We followed consecutive individuals without known coronary artery disease referred for clinical ETT at a large medical center. We measured the frequency and results of downstream imaging tests and invasive angiography within 6 months of ETT and the combined endpoint of survival free from cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization. Results Among 3,656 consecutive subjects who were followed for a mean of 2.5 ± 1.1 years, 332 (9.0%) underwent noninvasive imaging and 84 (2.3%) were referred directly to invasive angiography after ETT. The combined endpoint occurred in 76 (2.2%) patients. The annual incidence of the combined endpoint after negative, inconclusive, and positive ETT was 0.2%, 1.3%, and 12.4%, respectively (p < 0.001). Rapid recovery of electrocardiography (ECG) changes during ETT was associated with negative downstream test results and excellent prognosis, whereas typical angina despite negative ECG was associated with positive downstream tests and adverse prognosis (p < 0.001). Younger age, female sex, higher metabolic equivalents of task achieved, and rapid recovery of ECG changes were predictors of negative downstream tests. Conclusions Among patients referred for additional testing after ETT, the lowest yield was observed among individuals with rapid recovery of ECG changes or negative ETT, whereas the highest yield was observed among those with typical angina despite negative ECG or a positive ETT. These findings may be used to identify patients who are most and least likely to benefit from additional testing. ©2014 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.",downstream testing; exercise testing; imaging,"adult; angina pectoris; angiography; article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diagnostic accuracy; electrocardiography; event free survival; female; heart ejection fraction; heart muscle revascularization; human; incidence; ischemia; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pharmacologic stress testing; population research; predictive value; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; single photon emission computer tomography; ST segment depression; treadmill test; age; angina pectoris; angiocardiography; Article; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular system examination; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic value; disease free survival; downstream non invasive imaging; follow up; heart infarction; invasive procedure; metabolic equivalent; middle aged; non invasive measurement; outcome assessment; sensitivity and specificity; sex difference; treadmill exercise; downstream testing; exercise testing; imaging; Cause of Death; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Circulation; Electrocardiography; Exercise Test; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Massachusetts; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Recovery of Function; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Survival Rate; Time Factors; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"

Methods: Retrospective cohort study at two large hospitals, including all symptomatic patients without prior CAD who underwent both CCTA and CAC. Accuracy of CAC for the identification of ≥50% and ≥70% stenosis by CCTA was evaluated. Prognostic value of CAC and CCTA were compared for prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, late coronary revascularization (>90 days), and unstable angina requiring hospitalization). Results: Among 1145 included patients, the mean age was 55±12 years and median follow up 2.4 (IQR: 1.5-3.5) years. Overall, 406 (35%) CCTA were normal, 454 (40%) had <50% stenosis, and 285 (25%) had ≥50% stenosis. The prevalence of ≥70% stenosis was 16%. Among 483 (42%) patients with CAC zero, 395 (82%) had normal CCTA, 81 (17%) <50% stenosis, and 7 (1.5%)≥50% stenosis. 2 (0.4%) patients had ≥70% stenosis. For diagnosis of ≥50% stenosis, CAC had a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 55%. The negative predictive value (NPV) for CAC was 99% for ≥50% stenosis and 99.6% for ≥70% stenosis by CCTA. There were no adverse events among the 7 patients with zero calcium and ≥50% CAD. For prediction of MACE, the c-statistic for clinical risk factors of 0.62 increased to 0.73 (p<0.001) with CAC versus 0.77 (p=0.02) with CCTA. Conclusion: Among symptomatic patients with CAC zero, a 1-2% prevalence of potentially obstructive CAD occurs, although this finding was not associated with future coronary revascularization or adverse prognosis within 2 years. © 2014.",Atherosclerosis; Coronary artery calcium score; Coronary computed tomography angiography; Epidemiology,"Atherosclerosis; Coronary artery calcium score; Coronary computed tomography angiography; Epidemiology; Adult; Aged; Calcinosis; Calcium; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Stenosis; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

Background Prior studies have suggested a single polypill to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) at the population level. Methods Participants from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) were stratified using the criteria of 4 polypill studies (TIPS [The Indian Polycap Study], Poly-Iran, Wald, and the PILL [Program to Improve Life and Longevity] Collaboration). We compared coronary heart disease (CHD) and CVD event rates and calculated the 5-year number needed to treat (NNT) after stratification based on the CAC score. Results Among MESA participants eligible for TIPS, Poly-Iran, Wald, and the PILL Collaboration, CAC = 0 was observed in 58.6%, 54.5%, 38.9%, and 40.8%, respectively. The rate of CHD events among those with CAC = 0 varied from 1.2 to 1.9 events per 1,000 person-years, those with CAC scores from 1 to 100 had event rates ranging from 4.1 to 5.5, and in those with CAC scores >100 the event rate ranged from 11.6 to 13.3. The estimated 5-year NNT to prevent 1 CVD event ranged from 81-130 for patients with CAC = 0, 38-54 for those with CAC scores from 1 to 100, and 18-20 for those with CAC scores >100. Conclusions In MESA, among individuals eligible for treatment with the polypill, the majority of CHD and CVD events occurred in those with CAC scores >100. The group with CAC = 0 had a very low event rate and a high projected NNT. The avoidance of treatment in individuals with CAC = 0 could allow for significant reductions in the population considered for treatment, with a more selective use of the polypill and, as a result, avoidance of treatment in those who are unlikely to benefit. © 2014 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.",polypill; risk stratification; subclinical atherosclerosis,"acetylsalicylic acid; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; adult; aged; article; atherosclerosis; cardiovascular disease; coronary artery calcium score; ethnic group; event free survival; female; human; major clinical study; male; multidetector computed tomography; polypharmacy; polypill therapy; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; treatment duration; very elderly; Article; atherosclerosis; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; ethnic difference; ischemic heart disease; medical decision making; patient selection; risk reduction; CAC; cardiovascular disease; CHD; coronary artery calcium; coronary heart disease; CVD; Framingham risk score; FRS; hazard ratio; HR; NNT; number needed to treat; polypill; risk stratification; subclinical atherosclerosis; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Atherosclerosis; Calcinosis; Calcium; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Vessels; Drug Therapy, Combination; Ethnic Groups; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; United States"

While the traditional evaluation of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome often consists of serial electrocardiograms and cardiac biomarkers, followed by selective use of stress testing for further risk stratification, this approach is costly and inefficient. Recently, coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) has offered an alternative approach with a high sensitivity and negative predictive value to exclude obstructive coronary artery disease that can rapidly identify patients with low rates of downstream major adverse cardiac events. In this review, the authors provide an overview of available data on the use of CTA for evaluating acute chest pain, while emphasizing its advantages and disadvantages compared to existing strategies. In addition, we provide a suggested algorithm to identify how CTA can be incorporated into the evaluation of acute chest pain and discuss tips for successful implementation of CTA in the emergency department. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.",acute coronary syndrome; cardiovascular risk; chest pain; computed tomographic angiography; coronary artery disease; emergency department; major adverse cardiac events; resource utilization; risk stratification; standard of care; usual care,"acute coronary syndrome; clinical evaluation; comparative study; computed tomographic angiography; coronary artery recanalization; cost effectiveness analysis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic procedure; emergency ward; health care planning; human; image analysis; non invasive procedure; patient care; patient selection; review; risk benefit analysis; thorax pain; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Algorithms; Biological Markers; Chest Pain; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Electrocardiography; Emergency Service, Hospital; Exercise Test; Humans; Predictive Value of Tests; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

Objectives: To evaluate the value of a simple measure of subcutaneous tissue as a predictor of image noise in cardiac CT. Methods: 86 patients underwent prospective ECG-gated coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and coronary calcium scoring (CAC) with 120 kV and 150 mA. The image quality was objectively measured by the image noise in the aorta in the cardiac CTA, and low noise was defined as noise < 30HU. The chest anteroposterior diameter and lateral width, the image noise in the aorta and the skin-sternum (SS) thickness were measured as predictors of cardiac CTA noise. The association of the predictors and image noise was performed by using Pearson correlation. Results: The mean radiation dose was 3.5 ± 1.5 mSv. The mean image noise in CT was 36.3 ± 8.5 HU, and the mean image noise in non-contrast scan was 17.7 ± 4.4 HU. All predictors were independently associated with cardiac CTA noise. The best predictors were SS thickness, with a correlation of 0.70 (p < 0.001), and noise in the non-contrast images, with a correlation of 0.73 (p < 0.001). When evaluating the ability to predict low image noise, the areas under the ROC curve for the non-contrast noise and for the SS thickness were 0.837 and 0.864, respectively. Conclusion: Both SS thickness and CAC noise are simple accurate predictors of cardiac CTA image noise. Those parameters can be incorporated in standard CT protocols to adequately adjust radiation exposure.",Artifacts; Computed tomography; Radiation effects; Radiation injuries; Sternum,"beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; iopromide; adult; arterial wall thickness; article; body mass; computed tomographic angiography; computer assisted tomography; coronary artery calcium score; coronary artery disease; electrocardiography; female; human; image analysis; image quality; major clinical study; male; middle aged; radiation dose; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; skinfold thickness; Aged; Aortography; Artifacts; Body Mass Index; Coronary Angiography; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Radiation Dosage; Reference Values; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subcutaneous Tissue; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

The traditional strategy of evaluating acute chest pain by hospital or ED observation over a period of several hours, serial electrocardiography and cardiac biomarkers, and subsequent diagnostic testing such as physiologic stress testing is safe and effective. Yet this approach has been criticized for being time intensive and costly. This review evaluates the current medical evidence which has demonstrated the potential for coronary CT angiography (CTA) assessment of acute chest pain to safely reduce ED cost, time to discharge, and rate of hospital admission. These benefits must be weighed against the risk of ionizing radiation exposure and the influence of ED testing on rates of downstream coronary angiography and revascularization. Efforts at radiation minimization have quickly evolved, implementing technology such as prospective electrocardiographic gating and high pitch acquisition to significantly reduce radiation exposure over just a few years. CTA in the ED has demonstrated accuracy, safety, and the ability to reduce ED cost and crowding although its big-picture effect on total hospital and health care system cost extends far beyond the ED. The net effect of CTA is dependent also on the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the population where CTA is used, which significantly influences rates of post-CTA invasive procedures such as angiography and coronary revascularization. These potential costs and benefits will warrant careful consideration and prospective monitoring as additional hospitals continue to implement this important technology into their diagnostic regimen. © 2014.",Cardiac; Chest pain; Coronary computed tomography angiography; Emergency department,"angiocardiography; computed tomographic angiography; coronary artery disease; cost benefit analysis; electrocardiography; emergency ward; health care cost; health care system; heart muscle revascularization; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; invasive procedure; ionizing radiation; prevalence; radiation exposure; Review; risk benefit analysis; risk reduction; thorax pain; acute disease; angiocardiography; computer assisted tomography; emergency health service; length of stay; organization and management; procedures; radiography; thorax pain; thorax radiography; Acute Disease; Chest Pain; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Length of Stay; Radiography, Thoracic; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"
Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,Association between postprandial triglycerides and coronary artery disease detected by coronary computed tomography angiography,2014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896287568&doi=10.1016%2fj.atherosclerosis.2013.12.036&partnerID=40&md5=793264b8f234dc3970f14767f3afc2d2,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Background: Studies have demonstrated the association of severe anatomical coronary artery disease (CAD) with postprandial triglycerides (TG) concentrations. Nevertheless the relationship between less severe atherosclerosis plaque burden and postprandial TG is less established. Objective: to study the relationship between postprandial TG and CAD detected by coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Material and methods: 130 patients who underwent an oral fat tolerance test were enrolled (85 with CAD detected by CTA and 45 without). Postprandial lipemia was studied by measuring TG from T0h to T6h with 2-h intervals, and analyzed the TG change over time using a longitudinal multivariable linear mixed effects model with the log normal of the TG as the primary outcome. Results: The majority of individuals with CAD had non-obstructive disease (63.3%) Patients with CAD had a slower clearance of postprandial TG change from 4h to 6h (p<0.05) compared to patients without CAD. These results remained significant after adjustment for fasting TG and glucose, age, gender, body mass index, and waist circumference. However, those differences did not reach statistical significance after adjustment for fasting HDL-C. Conclusion: Patients with mild (<25% lumen obstruction) and moderate CAD (25-50% lumen obstruction) detected by coronary CTA had an impaired postprandial metabolism, with a delayed TG clearance, when compared to individuals with no CAD. This difference was partially explained by the lower HDL-C. Thus, though postprandial TG may contribute to the development of CAD, this association is partially related to low HDL-C. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Atherosclerosis; Coronary computed tomography angiography; Postprandial lipemia; Triglycerides,"antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; C reactive protein; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; fat intake; glucose blood level; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; age; aged; angiocardiography; article; blood sampling; body mass; cardiac gated imaging; cardiograph; cholesterol blood level; computed tomographic angiography; computed tomography scanner; controlled study; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery calcium score; diastolic blood pressure; diet restriction; disease association; dyslipidemia; family history; fat tolerance test; female; gender; glucose blood level; heart rate; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; image reconstruction; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; outcome assessment; postmenopause; postprandial state; priority journal; smoking; substitution therapy; systolic blood pressure; triacylglycerol blood level; waist circumference; analysis; anthropometry; atherosclerotic plaque; blood; calcinosis; computer assisted tomography; coronary artery disease; coronary artery obstruction; diagnostic use; fat intake; hypertension; metabolic syndrome X; pharmacokinetics; physiology; postprandial state; radiography; Adult; Aged; Anthropometry; Blood Glucose; Calcinosis; Cholesterol, HDL; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Stenosis; Dietary Fats; Fasting; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Metabolic Syndrome X; Middle Aged; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Postprandial Period; Smoking; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Triglycerides"
Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,CXCR3 controls T-cell accumulation in fat inflammation,2014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903157585&doi=10.1161%2fATVBAHA.113.303133&partnerID=40&md5=d308fe2363b299c009d62cd9293c0c43,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"OBJECTIVE - Obesity associates with increased numbers of inflammatory cells in adipose tissue (AT), including T cells, but the mechanism of T-cell recruitment remains unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that the chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3) participates in T-cell accumulation in AT of obese mice and thus in the regulation of local inflammation and systemic metabolism. APPROACH AND RESULTS - Obese wild-type mice exhibited higher mRNA expression of CXCR3 in periepididymal AT-derived stromal vascular cells compared with lean mice. We evaluated the function of CXCR3 in AT inflammation in vivo using CXCR3-deficient and wild-type control mice that consumed a high-fat diet. Periepididymal AT from obese CXCR3-deficient mice contained fewer T cells than obese controls after 8 and 16 weeks on high-fat diet, as assessed by flow cytometry. Obese CXCR3-deficient mice had greater glucose tolerance than obese controls after 8 weeks, but not after 16 weeks. CXCR3-deficient mice fed high-fat diet had reduced mRNA expression of proinflammatory mediators, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted, and anti-inflammatory genes, such as Foxp3, IL-10, and arginase-1 in periepididymal AT, compared with obese controls. CONCLUSIONS - These results demonstrate that CXCR3 contributes to T-cell accumulation in periepididymal AT of obese mice. Our results also suggest that CXCR3 regulates the accumulation of distinct subsets of T cells and that the ratio between these functional subsets across time likely modulates local inflammation and systemic metabolism. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",adipose tissue; CXCR3 receptors; inflammation; lymphocytes; macrophages; obesity,"chemokine receptor CXCR3; fat; messenger RNA; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; arginase 1 gene; article; bioaccumulation; controlled study; flow cytometry; FOXP3 gene; gene; gene expression; glucose tolerance; IL 10 gene; in vivo study; inflammation; inflammatory cell; lipid diet; metabolic regulation; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; adipose tissue; CXCR3, receptors; inflammation; lymphocytes; macrophages; obesity; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Chemotaxis, Leukocyte; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Regulation; Inflammation Mediators; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Obesity; Panniculitis; Receptors, CXCR3; Signal Transduction; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Time Factors"
Márcio Sommer Bittencourt,Reduction in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on serial cardiac positron emission tomography is associated with improved left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis,2014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893823584&doi=10.1007%2fs12350-013-9828-6&partnerID=40&md5=53b8f23d6f335879916f8b4b1b2f785d,Universidade de São Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Background: Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been used to diagnose and monitor cardiac sarcoidosis (CS). It is not known whether a reduction in myocardial inflammation, as measured by FDG uptake, is associated with improvement in LV ejection fraction (EF). Methods: For 23 patients with CS followed by a total of 90 serial PET exams (median 4 per patient), two physicians blinded to EF quantified the maximum of standardized uptake value (SUV) and volume of inflamed tissue above two distinct thresholds to assess the intensity and extent of FDG uptake on each study. Using gated 82Rubidium rest myocardial perfusion images, EF was measured blinded to all clinical and FDG data. To account for clustering and differences in scan frequency, a longitudinal mixed effects model was used to evaluate the relationship between FDG uptake and changes in EF on interval scans. Results: Among 23 patients with serial PET exams (mean age 49, 74% male, mean baseline EF 43% ± 13%), the median time between the first and last scan was 2.0 years. Overall, 91% were treated with corticosteroids, 78% with ACE/ARB, 83% with beta-blockers, and 83% had ICDs. Longitudinal regression demonstrated a significant inverse linear relationship between maximum SUV and EF with an expected increase in EF of 7.9% per SUV reduction of 10 g·mL-1 (P =.008). Likewise, in an analysis based on volume, there was an increase in EF of 2.1% per 100 cm 3 decrease in volume of inflamed tissue using a threshold of 2.7 g·mL-1 (P =.028) and an increase in EF of 3.8% per 100 cm 3 decrease (P =.022) using a SUV threshold of 4.1 g·mL -1. Conclusions: In a longitudinal cohort of CS patients, a reduction in the intensity and extent of myocardial inflammation on FDG PET is associated with improvement in EF. These data suggest serial PET scanning may help guide titration of immunosuppressive therapy to improve or prevent heart failure in CS. © 2013 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.",cardiomyopathy; fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG); metabolism; PET; PET imaging,"corticosteroid; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; radiopharmaceutical agent; rubidium; adult; cardiomyopathy; chemistry; female; heart; heart left ventricle function; heart muscle; human; inflammation; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; pathology; perfusion; positron emission tomography; procedures; sarcoidosis; scintiscanning; treatment outcome; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Cardiomyopathies; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Heart; Humans; Inflammation; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Perfusion; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radiopharmaceuticals; Rubidium Radioisotopes; Sarcoidosis; Treatment Outcome; Ventricular Function, Left"

OSA is an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease, particularly among men, but the independent contribution of OSA to cardiovascular risk in climacteric women is not clear. M ETHODS: We evaluated 277 consecutive women (age, 56 [52-61] years; BMI, 28 [25-32] kg/m2 ) without manifest cardiovascular disease (heart failure, coronary disease, or stroke). All women underwent 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, arterial stiff ness evaluation (pulse wave velocity), and portable sleep study. RESULTS: OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 5 events/h) and moderate to severe OSA (apneahypopnea index ≥ 15 events/h) were diagnosed in 111 (40.1%) and 31 (11.1%) women, respectively. None of the participants had received a previous diagnosis of OSA. Women with moderate to severe OSA vs those without OSA had a higher prevalence of hypertension, were prescribed more medications for hypertension, had higher awake BP (systolic, 133 [125-142] vs 126 [119-134] mm Hg [ P<.01]; diastolic, 82 [78-88] vs 79 [74-85] mm Hg [ P < .07]), higher nocturnal BP (systolic, 125 [118-135] vs 115 [109-124] mm Hg [ P<.01]; diastolic, 73 [69-79] vs 69 [62-75] mm Hg [ P<.01]), and more arterial stiff ness (pulse wave velocity, 11.5 [10.1-12.3] m/s vs 9.5 [8.6-10.8] m/s, P<.001). Oxy gen desaturation index during the night was independently associated with 24-h arterial BP and arterial stiff ness (per five-unit increase in oxygen desaturation index, β 1.30 [95% CI, 0.02-2.54; P < .04] vs 0.22 [95% CI, 0.03-0.40; P < .02] in women with vs without OSA, respectively).

Methods and Results-We identifed consecutive patients aged >18 years without prior CAD who underwent CCTA from 2004 to 2011 and had complete data on medications before and after CCTA. CCTA results were categorized as no CAD, <50% stenosis, and >50% stenosis. Based on the number of involved segments, extent of disease was categorized as nonextensive (<4 segments) or extensive CAD (>4 segments). Electronic medical records and patient interviews were reviewed blinded to CCTA fndings to assess initiation of aspirin and intensifcation of lipid-lowering therapies. Survival analysis was performed to evaluate intensifcation of lipid therapy as a predictor of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Among 2839 patients with mean follow-up of 3.6 years, the odds of physician intensifcation of lipid-lowering therapy signifcantly increased for those with nonobstructive CAD (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confdence interval, 2.9-4.9; P<0.001) and obstructive CAD (odds ratio, 5.6; 95% confdence interval, 4.3-7.3; P<0.001). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels declined signifcantly in association with intensifcation of lipid-lowering therapy after CCTA in all patient subgroups. In a hypothesis-generating analysis, among patients with nonobstructive but extensive CAD, statin use after CCTA was associated with a reduction in cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction (hazards ratio, 0.18; 95% confdence interval, 0.05-0.66; P=0.01). Conclusions-Abnormal CCTA fndings are associated with downstream intensifcation in statin and aspirin therapy. In particular, CCTA may lead to increased use of prognostically benefcial therapies in patients identifed as having extensive, nonobstructive CAD. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",Aspirin; Prevention and control; Prognosis,"aspirin; prevention and control; prognosis; Aspirin; Cholesterol, LDL; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Incidence; Male; Massachusetts; Middle Aged; Multidetector Computed Tomography; Odds Ratio; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Prognosis; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index"

Our objective was to evaluate the prognostic value of plaque extent detected by coronary computed tomography angiography. Methods and Results-All consecutive patients without prior CAD referred for coronary computed tomography angiography to evaluate for CAD were included. Examination findings were classified as normal, nonobstructive (<50% stenosis), or obstructive (=50%). Based on the number of segments with disease, extent of CAD was classified as nonextensive (=4 segments) or extensive (>4 segments). The cohort included 3242 patients followed for the primary outcome of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction for a median of 3.6 (2.1-5.0) years. In a multivariable analysis, the presence of extensive nonobstructive CAD (hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-6.4), nonextensive obstructive (hazard ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.9), and extensive obstructive CAD (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-7.2) were associated with an increased rate of events, whereas nonextensive, nonobstructive CAD was not. The addition of plaque extent to a model that included clinical probability as well as the presence and severity of CAD improved risk prediction. Conclusions-Among patients with nonobstructive CAD, those with extensive plaque experienced a higher rate of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction, comparable with those who have nonextensive disease. Even among patients with obstructive CAD, greater extent of nonobstructive plaque was associated with higher event rate. Our findings suggest that regardless of whether obstructive or nonobstructive disease is present, the extent of plaque detected by coronary computed tomography angiography enhances risk assessment. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",Coronary Artery Disease; Prognosis; Risk Assessment,"adult; article; cardiovascular risk; computed tomographic angiography; coronary artery disease; death; disease severity; female; heart infarction; heart muscle revascularization; human; major clinical study; male; prediction; priority journal; probability; prognosis; coronary artery disease; prognosis; risk assessment; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Male; Massachusetts; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Rate; Time Factors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

However, concern exists whether implementation of cCTA in the assessment of patients presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain will lead to increased downstream testing and costs compared with alternative strategies. Our aim was to compare observed actual costs of usual care (UC) with projected costs of a strategy including early cCTA in the evaluation of patients with acute chest pain in the Rule Out Myocardial Infarction Using Computer Assisted Tomography I (ROMICAT I) study. Methods and Results-We compared cost and hospital length of stay of UC observed among 368 patients enrolled in the ROMICAT I study with projected costs of management based on cCTA. Costs of UC were determined by an electronic cost accounting system. Notably, UC was not influenced by cCTA results because patients and caregivers were blinded to the cCTA results. Costs after early implementation of cCTA were estimated assuming changes in management based on cCTA findings of the presence and severity of CAD. Sensitivity analysis was used to test the influence of key variables on both outcomes and costs. We determined that in comparison with UC, cCTA-guided triage, whereby patients with no CAD are discharged, could reduce total hospital costs by 23% (P<0.001). However, when the prevalence of obstructive CAD increases, index hospitalization cost increases such that when the prevalence of ≥50% stenosis is >28% to 33%, the use of cCTA becomes more costly than UC. Conclusions-cCTA may be a cost-saving tool in acute chest pain populations that have a prevalence of potentially obstructive CAD <30%. However, increased cost would be anticipated in populations with higher prevalence of disease. Clinical Trial Registration-URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

METHODS: The ERICO study, which is being performed at a secondary general hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil, is enrolling consecutive acute coronary syndrome patients who are 35 years old or older. The sociodemographic information, medical assessments, treatment data and blood samples are collected at admission. After 30 days, the medical history is updated, and additional blood and urinary samples are collected. In addition, a retinography, carotid intima-media thickness, heart rate variability and pulse-wave velocity are performed. Questionnaires about food frequency, physical activity, sleep apnea and depression are also applied. At six months and annually after an acute event, information is collected by telephone. RESULTS: From February 2009 to September 2011, 738 patients with a diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome were enrolled. Of these, 208 (28.2%) had ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 288 (39.0%) had non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and 242 (32.8%) had unstable angina (UA). The mean age was 62.7 years, 58.5% were men and 77.4% had 8 years or less of education. The most common cardiovascular risk factors were hypertension (76%) and sedentarism (73.4%). Only 29.2% had a prior history of coronary heart disease. Compared with the ST-elevation myocardial infarction subgroup, the unstable angina and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients had higher frequencies of hypertension, diabetes, prior coronary heart disease (p,0.001) and dyslipidemia (p = 0.03). Smoking was more frequent in the ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients (p =0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other hospital registries, our findings revealed a higher burden of CV risk factors and less frequent prior CHD history. © 2013 CLINICS.",Coronary acute syndrome; Epidemiology; Registries,"acute coronary syndrome; adult; aged; article; Brazil; coronary artery disease; epidemiology; female; human; male; middle aged; register; reproducibility; risk factor; standard; time; very elderly; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brazil; Coronary Disease; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Registries; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Time Factors"

Background: CCTA allows rapid evaluation of patients presenting to the ED with acute chest pain syndromes; however, the impact of such testing on patient management and downstream testing has emerged as a concern. Methods: We systematically searched for randomized, controlled trials of CCTA in the ED and performed a meta-analysis of clinical outcomes. Results: Four randomized, controlled trials were included, with 1,869 patients undergoing CCTA and 1,397 undergoing UC. There were no deaths and no difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction, post-discharge ED visits, or rehospitalizations. Four studies reported decreased length of stay with CCTA and 3 reported cost savings; 8.4% of patients undergoing CCTA versus 6.3% of those receiving UC underwent invasive coronary angiography (ICA), whereas 4.6% of patients undergoing CCTA versus 2.6% of those receiving UC underwent coronary revascularization. The odds ratio of ICA for CCTA patients versus UC patients was 1.36 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 1.80, p = 0.030), and for revascularization, it was 1.81 (95% CI: 1.20 to 2.72, p = 0.004). The absolute increase in ICA after CCTA was 21 per 1,000 CCTA patients (95% CI: 1.8 to 44.9), and the number needed to scan was 48. The absolute increase in revascularization after CCTA was 20 per 1,000 patients (95% CI: 5.0 to 41.4); the number needed to scan was 50. Both percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft surgery independently contributed to the significant increase in revascularization. Conclusions: Compared with UC, the use of CCTA in the ED is associated with decreased ED cost and length of stay but increased ICA and revascularization. © 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",coronary angiography; coronary artery bypass graft surgery; coronary computed tomography angiography; emergency department; percutaneous coronary intervention,"acute coronary syndrome; adult; angiocardiography; computed tomographic angiography; coronary artery bypass graft; coronary artery disease; cost control; emergency ward; female; heart infarction; heart muscle revascularization; hospital readmission; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; meta analysis; multidetector computed tomography; percutaneous coronary intervention; priority journal; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; systematic review; thorax pain; Chest Pain; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Bypass; Cost Savings; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Length of Stay; Myocardial Infarction; Patient Readmission; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Survival Analysis; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Triage"

Objective this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a zero CAC when compared to the coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) at the emergency department. 135 symptomatic patients with no previous coronary heart disease (CHD) who presented to the emergency department were submitted to CAC and CCTA to rule out CHD. All patients had normal electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers and were TIMI risk score 0 to 2. The CCTA was considered positive if any obstructive lesion (> 50%) was identified. The mean age was 51.7 ± 13.6 years with 50.6% of men. Seventy-three (54.1%) patients had a calcium score of zero. Of them, 3 (4.1%) had an obstruction > 50% and underwent invasive coronary angiography. Calcium score showed a sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 75.3%, positive and negative predictive values of, respectively, 62.9% and 95.9%. Positive and negative likelihood ratios were respectively of 3.7 and 0.09 to detect lesions greater than 50% in the CCTA. A negative likelihood ratio of 0.09 is very good to rule out most cases of significant coronary obstruction in epidemiologic studies. However, it is important to understand that in a clinical scenario, all evidence including history, clinical examination, data from eletrocardiogram and myocardial biomarkers have to be interpreted together. In our study, three cases with a zero CAC score had coronary obstruction higher than 50% at the CCTA.",Calcium/metabolism; Chest pain; Computed tomography; Coronary disease,"atenolol; nitrate; acute coronary syndrome; adult; aged; angiocardiography; article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; coronary artery calcium score; coronary artery obstruction; coronary computed tomography angiography; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; emergency ward; female; heart rate; human; major clinical study; male; predictive value; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; stenosis; thorax pain; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Adult; Aged; Calcium; Chest Pain; Coronary Angiography; Emergency Medical Services; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reference Values; Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed"

Outcomes data is accumulating and demonstrating that CCTA has excellent prognostic value. Given CCTA's consistently proven accuracy and improved safety related to radiation sparing techniques, public health officials have called for comparative cost-effectiveness research of CCTA vs other diagnostic testing strategies for assessing possible angina in symptomatic patients. In this article, we review the available cost studies of CCTA in comparison with other diagnostic strategies. Currently available data are limited but include 5 completed randomized trials, 11 observational studies, 7 studies using theoretical mathematical modeling, and 4 reports of the cost impact of incidental findings on CCTA.

Objective: We identified typical thrombi attenuation of left ventricular thrombi with the use of CT measurement. Methods: Over a time period of 6 years, we retrospectively identified 31 patients who showed a left ventricular thrombus in CT angiography datasets. Patients underwent routine contrast cardiac CT to investigate coronary artery disease. CT attenuation of each thrombus was assessed in the 4-chamber view. CT densities were also determined in the ascending aorta, left ventricle, and myocardial wall both in the mid-septal and mid-lateral segments. The mean CT attenuation of thrombi and the difference between attenuation in thrombi, left ventricular cavity, and myocardial wall were determined. The ratio of attenuation values in thrombus versus aorta and myocardium versus aorta were also determined. Results: Mean (±SD) CT attenuation of all left ventricular thrombi in 31 patients was 43.2 ± 15.3 HU (range, 25-80 HU). Mean CT densities of septal and lateral myocardial wall were 102.9 ± 23.1 HU (range, 63-155 HU) and 99.3 ± 28.7 HU (range, 72-191 HU), respectively, and were thus significantly higher than the CT attenuation of thrombi (. P < 0.001). A threshold of 65 HU yielded a sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 94%, 97%, 94%, and 97%, respectively, to differentiate thrombus from the myocardial wall. The mean ratio between CT attenuation of thrombus and CT attenuation within the ascending aorta was 0.11 ± 0.05 (range, 0.04-0.23), which was significantly lower compared with the mean ratio between CT attenuation of the myocardial wall and the CT attenuation within the ascending aorta. Conclusion: CT attenuation within left ventricular thrombi was significantly lower than myocardial attenuation in CT angiography datasets. Assessment of CT attenuation may contribute to the differentiation of thrombi. © 2012 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography.",Attenuation values; Cardiac computed tomography; Ventricular thrombi,"adult; aged; article; ascending aorta; clinical article; computed tomographic angiography; congestive cardiomyopathy; coronary artery disease; female; heart left ventricle function; heart muscle tension; human; ischemic cardiomyopathy; left ventricular thrombus; male; predictive value; priority journal; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; thrombus; Aged; Coronary Angiography; Germany; Heart Diseases; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Male; Myocardium; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; Thrombosis; Time Factors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

Among this development, imaging has taken one of the leading positions. Nevertheless, this increase in medical imaging use comes at a significant cost. The most common medical imaging techniques used radiation to acquire the image. From the initial X ray technology form the end of the nineteen century to today's computed tomography and nuclear medicine technology, medical image came from an insignificant to the second most important cause of radiation exposure throughout the world. Although this information may sound negative, medical imaging has an invaluable use in diagnostic and therapeutic medicine. Therefore, it should not be blamed for the radiation exposure; it should only be controlled and adequately used to optimize the medical benefits while reducing the risks associated with the increase in radiation exposure. In this chapter we will discuss the increase in radiation exposure from medical imaging, while focusing on potential technical interventions that can help reducing exposure and optimize equipment to prevent the use of unnecessary radiation. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We evaluated the ability of ""Iterative Reconstruction in Image Space"" (IRIS) reconstruction to reduce image noise and improve subjective image quality. 55 consecutive patients undergoing coronary CT angiography to rule out coronary artery stenosis were included. A dual source CT system and standard protocols were used. Images were reconstructed using standard filtered back projection and IRIS. Image noise, attenuation within the coronary arteries, contrast, signal to noise and contrast to noise parameters as well as subjective classification of image quality (using a scale with four categories) were evaluated and compared between the two image reconstruction protocols. Subjective image quality (2.8 ± 0.4 in filtered back projection and 2.8 ± 0.4 in iterative reconstruction) and the number of ""evaluable"" segments per patient 14.0 ± 1.2 in filtered back projection and 14.1 ± 1.1 in iterative reconstruction) were not significant different between the two methods. However iterative reconstruction had a lower image noise (22.6 ± 4.5 HU vs. 28.6 ± 5.1 HU) and higher signal to noise and image to noise ratios in the proximal coronary arteries. IRIS reduces image noise and contrast-to-noise ratio in coronary CT angiography, thus providing potential for reducing radiation exposure. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",Coronary computed tomography; Image quality; Iterative reconstruction,"iopromide; adult; article; cardiac imaging; computer assisted tomography; contrast; controlled study; coronary artery; coronary artery obstruction; coronary computer assisted tomography; female; human; image analysis; image display; image processing; image quality; image reconstruction; iterative reconstruction in image space; major clinical study; male; radiological parameters; signal noise ratio; Adult; Aged; Artifacts; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Stenosis; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Radiation Dosage; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

Cytopathological capability of identifying lesions was 50% when compared to histology. Its specificity was 77%, the sensibility 41%, the PPV 74%, and the NPV 45%. Colposcopy capability of identifying lesions was 50%. Its sensibility, specificity, PPV and NPV were 96%, 19%, 65% and 75% respectively. The two methods associated were capable of identifying 63% of the lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Cytopathology was a high specificity exam, while colposcopy from those selected patients had a high sensibility. Colposcopy association with cytopathological screening, on those selected patients, significantly raises the diagnostic accuracy of cervical cancer precursor lesions.",,adolescent; adult; aged; article; chi square distribution; colposcopy; evaluation; female; human; middle aged; pathology; prediction and forecasting; sensitivity and specificity; uterine cervix disease; vagina smear; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Chi-Square Distribution; Colposcopy; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Sensitivity and Specificity; Uterine Cervical Diseases; Vaginal Smears
