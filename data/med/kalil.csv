Roberto Kalil Filho,Phase II study of paclitaxel associated with lipid core nanoparticles (LDE) as third-line treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma,2017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026797616&doi=10.1007%2fs12032-017-1009-z&partnerID=40&md5=85bbb5429305656d8066cf2178b576b5,Universidade de Sâo Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages, when poorly responsive to standard treatment. First-line treatment consists in schemes including cytoreductive surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy schemes with platinum and taxane derivatives. Second-line regimens are based on gemcitabine and liposomal doxorubicin. Third line is often not worthwhile because of the high toxicity with poor response to treatment. Previously, we showed that paclitaxel (PTX) carried in non-protein lipid core nanoparticles (LDE) resembling the chemical structure of LDL has remarkably reduced toxicity. Here, the hypothesis was tested whether PTX-LDE could safely benefit patients in third-line treatment setting. Fourteen women unresponsive to second-line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, aged 61 ± 10 years, clinical stage IV and TqNqM1, were included. PTX-LDE was administered at 175 mg/m2, 3/3 week dose. Patients were submitted to clinical examinations before each chemotherapy cycle. Serum biochemistry and imaging examinations to monitor disease progression were performed. In total, 74 cycles of chemotherapy were done and, in all cycles, clinical or laboratorial toxicities were not observed. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 months (95% CI 2.0–3.9). In four patients, PFS was &gt;6 months and in 2 &gt; 1 year. The unpreceded, striking absence of toxicity and consistently long PFS, compared to previous results, indicate that at least 4 among 14 patients had tumor arrest by the treatment and clear benefit of PTX-LDE at third-line setting. The absence of observable toxicity allows dose escalating to improve response to treatment, as perspective to be tested in the ensuing studies. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Drug delivery and cancer; Drug targeting and cancer; LDL receptors; Ovarian cancer treatment; Solid lipid particles,
Roberto Kalil Filho,Biomarker release after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients without established myocardial infarction as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance with late gadolinium enhancement,2017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020072069&doi=10.1002%2fccd.27125&partnerID=40&md5=428fd6c97d874184c8d3dabcd3ad0d05,Universidade de Sâo Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the amount and pattern of cardiac biomarker release after elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients without evidence of a new myocardial infarction (MI) after the procedure as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Background: The release of myocardial necrosis biomarkers after PCI frequently occurs. However, the correlation between biomarker release and the diagnosis of procedure-related MI type 4a has been controversial. Methods: Patients with normal baseline cardiac biomarkers who were referred for elective PCI were prospectively included. CMR with LGE was performed in all of the patients before and after the intervention. Measurements of troponin I (TnI) and creatine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB) were systematically performed before and after the procedure. Patients with a new LGE on the post-procedure CMR were excluded. Results: Of the 56 patients with no evidence of a procedure-related MI as assessed by CMR after the PCI, 48 (85.1%) exhibited an elevation of TnI above the 99th percentile. In 32 patients (57.1%), the peak was greater than five times this limit. Additionally, 17 patients (30.4%) had a CK-MB peak above the 99th percentile limit, but this peak was greater than five times the 99th percentile in only two patients (3.6%). The median peak release of TnI was 0.290 (0.061–1.09) ng/mL, which was 7.25-fold higher than the 99th percentile. Conclusions: In contrast to CK-MB, an abnormal release of TnI often occurs after an elective PCI procedure, despite the absence of a new LGE on CMR. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; coronary artery disease; percutaneous coronary intervention; troponin,
Roberto Kalil Filho,Methotrexate carried in lipid core nanoparticles reduces myocardial infarction size and improves cardiac function in rats,2017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019927991&doi=10.2147%2fIJN.S129324&partnerID=40&md5=49431f061e9d82e4edc8d3f3c578e768,Universidade de Sâo Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Purpose: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is accompanied by myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, and ventricular remodeling that, when excessive or not properly regulated, may lead to heart failure. Previously, lipid core nanoparticles (LDE) used as carriers of the anti-inflammatory drug methotrexate (MTX) produced an 80-fold increase in the cell uptake of MTX. LDE-MTX treatment reduced vessel inflammation and atheromatous lesions induced in rabbits by cholesterol feeding. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of LDE-MTX on rats with MI, compared with commercial MTX treatment. Materials and methods: Thirty-eight Wistar rats underwent left coronary artery ligation and were treated with LDE-MTX, or with MTX (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally, once/week, starting 24 hours after surgery) or with LDE without drug (MI-controls). A sham-surgery group (n=12) was also included. Echocardiography was performed 24 hours and 6 weeks after surgery. The animals were euthanized and their hearts were analyzed for morphometry, protein expression, and confocal microscopy. Results: LDE-MTX treatment achieved a 40% improvement in left ventricular (LV) systolic function and reduced cardiac dilation and LV mass, as shown by echocardiography. LDE-MTX reduced the infarction size, myocyte hypertrophy and necrosis, number of inflammatory cells, and myocardial fibrosis, as shown by morphometric analysis. LDE-MTX increased antioxidant enzymes; decreased apoptosis, macrophages, reactive oxygen species production; and tissue hypoxia in non-infarcted myocardium. LDE-MTX increased adenosine bioavailability in the LV by increasing adenosine receptors and modulating adenosine catabolic enzymes. LDE-MTX increased the expression of myocardial vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) associated with adenosine release; this correlated not only with an increase in angiogenesis, but also with other parameters improved by LDE-MTX, suggesting that VEGF increase played an important role in the beneficial effects of LDE-MTX. Overall effects of commercial MTX were minor, and did not improve LV function or infarction size. Both treatments did not induce any toxicity. Conclusion: The remarkable improvement in heart function and reduction in infarction size achieved by LDE-MTX supports future clinical trials. © 2017 Maranhão et al.",Adenosine; Drug delivery; Lipid particle; Myocardial infarction; VEGF,

Roberto Kalil Filho,Chagas' heart disease: gender differences in myocardial damage assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance,2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84997343311&doi=10.1186%2fs12968-016-0307-5&partnerID=40&md5=5618f22d88f28d6e4d9dce12ed19d7f3,Universidade de Sâo Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Background: Since a male-related higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with Chagas' heart disease has been reported, we aimed to investigate gender differences in myocardial damage assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Methods and results: Retrospectively, 62 seropositive Chagas' heart disease patients referred to CMR (1.5 T) and with low probability of having significant coronary artery disease were included in this analysis. Amongst both sexes, there was a strong negative correlation between LV ejection fraction and myocardial fibrosis (male r = 0.64, female r = 0.73, both P < 0.001), with males showing significantly greater myocardial fibrosis (P = 0.002) and lower LV ejection fraction (P < 0.001) than females. After adjustment for potential confounders, gender remained associated with myocardial dysfunction, and 53% of the effect was mediated by myocardial fibrosis (P for mediation = 0.004). Also, the transmural pattern was more prevalent among male patients (23.7 vs. 9.9%, P < 0.001) as well as the myocardial heterogeneity or gray zone (2.2 vs. 1.3 g, P = 0.003). Conclusions: We observed gender-related differences in myocardial damage assessed by CMR in patients with Chagas' heart disease. As myocardial fibrosis and myocardial dysfunction are associated to cardiovascular outcomes, our findings might help to understand the poorer prognosis observed in males in Chagas' disease. © 2016 The Author(s).",Chagas' heart disease; Gender differences; Myocardial dysfunction; Myocardial fibrosis,

This study evaluated the morphological and functional characteristics of the heart as well the extent of myocardial fibrosis (MF) in patients with CD by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). The prognostic value of MF evaluated by myocardialdelayed enhancement (MDE) was compared with that via Rassi score. Methods: This study assessed 39 patients divided into 2 groups: 28 asymptomatic patients as indeterminate form group (IND); and symptomatic patients as Chagas Heart Disease (CHD) group. All patients underwent CMR using the techniques of cine-MRI and MDE, and the amount of MF was compared with the Rassi score. Results: Regarding the morphological and functional analysis, significant differences were observed between both groups (p < 0.001). Furthermore, there was a strong correlation between the extent of MF and the Rassi score (r = 0.76). Conclusions: CMR is an important technique for evaluating patients with CD, stressing morphological and functional differences in all clinical presentations. The strong correlation with the Rassi score and the extent of MF detected by CMR emphasizes its role in the prognostic stratification of patients with CD. © 2016, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

Methods Patients with stable multivessel disease who underwent percutaneous or surgical revascularization were included. Electrocardiograms and concentrations of high-sensitive cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and creatine kinase (CK)-MB were assessed before and after procedures. Cardiac magnetic resonance and late gadolinium enhancement were performed before and after procedures. MI was defined as more than five times the 99th percentile upper reference limit for cTnI and 10 times for CK-MB in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), respectively, and new late gadolinium enhancement for cardiac magnetic resonance. Results Of the 202 patients studied, 69 (34.1%) underwent on-pump CABG, 67 (33.2%) off-pump CABG, and 66 (32.7%) PCI. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed the accuracy of cTnI for on-pump CABG, off-pump CABG, and PCI patients was 21.7%, 28.3%, and 52.4% and for CK-MB was 72.5%, 81.2%, and 90.5%, respectively. The specificity of cTnI was 3.6%, 9.4%, and 42.1% and of CK-MB was 73.2%, 86.8%, and 96.4%, respectively. Sensitivity of cTnI was 100%, 100%, and 100% and of CK-MB was 69.2%, 64.3%, and 44.4%, respectively. The best cutoff of cTnI for on-pump CABG, off-pump CABG, and PCI was 6.5 ng/mL, 4.5 ng/mL, and 4.5 ng/mL (162.5, 112.5, and 112.5 times the 99th percentile upper reference limit) and of CK-MB was 37.5 ng/mL, 22.5 ng/mL, and 11.5 ng/mL (8.5, 5.1, and 2.6 times the 99th percentile upper reference limit), respectively. Conclusions Compared with cardiac magnetic resonance, CK-MB was more accurate than cTnI for diagnosing MI. These data suggest a higher troponin cutoff for the diagnosis of procedure-related MI. © 2016 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",,"biological marker; creatine kinase MB; gadolinium; troponin I; biological marker; creatine kinase MB; troponin I; adult; Article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; coronary artery bypass graft; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; electrocardiogram; female; heart infarction; human; major clinical study; male; off pump coronary surgery; on pump coronary surgery; percutaneous coronary intervention; priority journal; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; revascularization; sensitivity and specificity; vascular disease; adverse effects; aged; blood; cine magnetic resonance imaging; cohort analysis; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; mortality; Myocardial Infarction; procedures; prognosis; retrospective study; severity of illness index; survival analysis; Aged; Biomarkers; Cohort Studies; Coronary Artery Bypass; Creatine Kinase, MB Form; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Troponin I"

Several anatomical scores have been developed as surrogates for overall atherosclerotic burden in coronary CTA and even proven to be highly predictive for future adverse events. However, they have not been validated against the gold standard for atherosclerotic burden, intra-vascular ultrasound (IVUS). In the present study we have compared several coronary CTA scores with the coronary IVUS. Methods and results: A total of 62 patients with diagnosed coronary disease scheduled for percutaneous intervention were prospectively enrolled. For all patients, coronary CTA and multivessel IVUS were obtained. Calcium score and 6 previously reported scores were calculated from coronary CTA imaging and compared to average IVUS-derived percent atheroma volume (PAV). On average, 3.8 ± 0.7 vessels, comprising 123.8 ± 31.3 mm in length, were imaged with IVUS per patient. All but one previously described scoring systems showed a significant association with IVUS-derived PAV. Among them, the SSS score demonstrated the strongest correlation with IVUS-PAV (r = 0.61, p < 0.001) and the greatest area under the ROC curve (C-statistic = 0.87), to predict a high PAV. Conclusions: Most frequently used coronary CTA scores have a good correlation with global coronary atherosclerotic burden measured by multivessel IVUS derived atheroma volume. Among them, the SSS score shows the best performance being a good non-invasive alternative to IVUS for global coronary atherosclerotic burden assessment. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Atherosclerosis; Computed tomography; Coronary disease; Intravascular ultrasound,"glyceryl trinitrate; adult; angiocardiography; angiography device; area under the curve; Article; atheroma; cardiovascular disease assessment; comparative study; computed tomographic angiography; computed tomography scanner; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery calcium score; coronary artery disease; correlation analysis; female; Friesinger score; Gensini score; high risk population; human; intravascular ultrasound; intravascular ultrasound catheter; Leaman score; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multidetector computed tomography; percutaneous coronary intervention; priority journal; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; secondary prevention; aged; atherosclerotic plaque; blood vessel calcification; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; coronary blood vessel; diagnostic imaging; interventional ultrasonography; predictive value; procedures; reproducibility; severity of illness index; validation study; Aged; Area Under Curve; Computed Tomography Angiography; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Vessels; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index; Ultrasonography, Interventional; Vascular Calcification"

Design: A prospective randomized controlled trial and an updated metaanalysis of randomized trials published from inception up to May 1, 2015. Setting: Surgical ICU within a tertiary referral university-affiliated teaching hospital. Patients: One hundred twenty-six high-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery or valve repair. Interventions: Patients were randomized to a cardiac output-guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm (goal-directed therapy group, n = 62) or to usual care (n = 64). In the goal-directed therapy arm, a cardiac index of greater than 3 L/min/m2 was targeted with IV fluids, inotropes, and RBC transfusion starting from cardiopulmonary bypass and ending 8 hours after arrival to the ICU. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of 30-day mortality and major postoperative complications. Patients from the goal-directed therapy group received a greater median (interquartile range) volume of IV fluids than the usual care group (1,000 [625-1,500] vs 500 [500-1,000] mL; p &lt; 0.001], with no differences in the administration of either inotropes or RBC transfusions. The primary outcome was reduced in the goal-directed therapy group (27.4% vs 45.3%; p = 0.037). The goal-directed therapy group had a lower occurrence rate of infection (12.9% vs 29.7%; p = 0.002) and low cardiac output syndrome (6.5% vs 26.6%; p = 0.002). We also observed lower ICU cumulative dosage of dobutamine (12 vs 19 mg/kg; p = 0.003) and a shorter ICU (3 [3-4] vs 5 [4-7] d; p &lt; 0.001) and hospital length of stay (9 [8-16] vs 12 [9-22] d; p = 0.049) in the goal-directed therapy compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in 30-day mortality rates (4.8% vs 9.4%, respectively; p = 0.492). The metaanalysis identified six trials and showed that, when compared with standard treatment, goal-directed therapy reduced the overall rate of complications (goal-directed therapy, 47/410 [11%] vs usual care, 92/415 [22%]; odds ratio, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.26-0.63]; p &lt; 0.0001) and decreased the hospital length of stay (mean difference,-5.44 d; 95% CI,-9.28 to-1.60; p = 0.006) with no difference in postoperative mortality: 9 of 410 (2.2%) versus 15 of 415 (3.6%), odds ratio, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.26-1.47), and p = 0.27.

Background The elevation of markers of inflammation and of myocardial necrosis after percutaneous coronary intervention may interfere with clinical outcome. Among acute coronary syndrome patients, statins improve clinical outcomes when used before CSI - mostly due to reduction of CSI-related myocardial infarction. However, little is known concerning preprocedural statin therapy on the reduction of these markers in stable patients at low-risk. Methods In this prospective, observational study, 100 patients (n = 50 on statin therapy vs. n = 50 not on statin) with stable coronary artery disease underwent elective CSI. Inflammatory (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and matrix metalloproteinase-9) and myocardial necrosis markers (troponin I and CK-MB) were determined before and 24 hr after CSI. Results All patients presented a significant increase of CRP and IL-6 after CSI. However, this increase was attenuated in patients on statin therapy prior to CSI than those without statin therapy: 75% vs. 150% (P < 0.001) and 192% vs. 300% (P < 0.01). The other pro-inflammatory markers were similar for both sets of patients. Troponin I and CK-MB did not change after CSI regardless of previous statin therapy or not. Conclusions Pretreatment with statin attenuates procedural inflammation, denoted by markedly lower increases of CRP and IL-6 levels, in elective CSI within low-risk stable CAD patients. Periprocedural myocardial injury was irrelevant and was not affected by preprocedural statin therapy in this population. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",coronary stent implantation; inflammatory markers; myocardial damage; stable coronary artery disease; statin,"acetylsalicylic acid; atorvastatin; C reactive protein; clopidogrel; creatine kinase MB; ezetimibe plus simvastatin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; interleukin 6; rosuvastatin; simvastatin; troponin I; antiinflammatory agent; autacoid; biological marker; C reactive protein; creatine kinase MB; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; IL6 protein, human; interleukin 6; troponin I; adult; Article; blood sampling; clinical article; controlled study; coronary artery disease; coronary stenting; female; heart muscle injury; heart muscle necrosis; human; inflammation; loading drug dose; low risk patient; male; observational study; preoperative treatment; prospective study; adverse effects; aged; blood; cardiac muscle; coronary artery disease; devices; metabolism; middle aged; necrosis; pathology; percutaneous coronary intervention; risk factor; stent; treatment outcome; Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Biomarkers; C-Reactive Protein; Coronary Artery Disease; Creatine Kinase, MB Form; Female; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Inflammation Mediators; Interleukin-6; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Necrosis; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stents; Treatment Outcome; Troponin I"

Several aspects of the pathogenesis are not fully understood, especially in its subclinical phases. On pathology Chagas' heart disease is characterized by chronic myocardial inflammation and extensive myocardial fibrosis. The latter has also been demonstrated by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). In three clinical phases of this disease, we sought to investigate the presence of LGE, myocardial increase in signal intensity in T2-weighted images (T2W) and in T1-weighted myocardial early gadolinium enhancement (MEGE), previously described CMR surrogates for myocardial fibrosis, myocardial edema and hyperemia, respectively. Methods: Fifty-four patients were analyzed. Sixteen patients with the indeterminate phase (IND), seventeen patients with the cardiac phase with no left ventricular systolic dysfunction (CPND), and twenty-one patients with the cardiac phase with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (CPD). All patients underwent 1.5 T CMR scan including LGE, T2W and MEGE image sequences to evaluate myocardial abnormalities. Results: Late gadolinium enhancement was present in 72.2 % of all patients, in 12.5 % of IND, 94.1 % of the CPND and 100 % of the CPD patients (p < 0.0001). Myocardial increase in signal intensity in T2-weighted images (T2W) was present in 77.8 % of all patients, in 31.3 % of the IND, 94.1 % of the CPND and 100 % of the CPD patients (p < 0.0001). T1-weighted myocardial early gadolinium enhancement (MEGE) was present in 73.8 % of all patients, in 25.0 % of the IND, 92.3 % of the CPND and 94.1 % of the CPD (p < 0.0001). A good correlation between LGE and T2W was observed (r = 0.72, and p < 0.001). Conclusions: Increase in T2-weighted (T2W) myocardial signal intensity and T1-weighted myocardial early gadolinium enhancement (MEGE) can be detected by CMR in patients throughout all phases of Chagas' heart disease, including its subclinical presentation (IND). Moreover, those findings were parallel to myocardial fibrosis (LGE) in extent and location and also correlated with the degree of Chagas' heart disease clinical severity. These findings contribute to further the knowledge on pathophysiology of Chagas' heart disease, and might have therapeutic and prognostic usefulness in the future. © 2015 Torreão et al.",Cardiovascular magnetic resonance; Chagas' heart disease; Fibrosis; Late gadolinium enhancement; Myocarditis; T2 weighted image,"gadolinium; contrast medium; gadolinium 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetate; heterocyclic compound; organometallic compound; adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; Chagas disease; contrast enhancement; cross-sectional study; disease severity; female; heart muscle fibrosis; human; left ventricular systolic dysfunction; major clinical study; male; priority journal; very elderly; cardiac muscle; Chagas cardiomyopathy; fibrosis; heart edema; heart left ventricle function; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parasitology; pathology; pathophysiology; predictive value; severity of illness index; systole; Adult; Aged; Chagas Cardiomyopathy; Contrast Media; Cross-Sectional Studies; Edema, Cardiac; Female; Fibrosis; Heterocyclic Compounds; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Organometallic Compounds; Predictive Value of Tests; Severity of Illness Index; Systole; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left"

However, few studies investigated the association of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with peripheral arterial disease. Methods: In a cross sectional study 202 heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients (91% confirmed by molecular diagnosis) were compared to 524 normolipidemic controls. Peripheral arterial disease was diagnosed by ankle-brachial index values ≤0.90. Results: Compared with controls, familial hypercholesterolemia patients were older, more often female, with higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, previous coronary disease and higher total cholesterol levels. Smoking (previous and former) was more common among controls. The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease was 17.3 and 2.3% respectively in familial hypercholesterolemia and controls (p < 0.001). Results persisted after matching familial hypercholesterolemia and controls by a propensity score. Regression analyses demonstrated that age (odds ratio- OR = 1.03 95% CI 1.00-1.05, p = 0.033), previous cardiovascular disease (OR = 3.12 CI 95% 1.56-6.25, p = 0.001) and familial hypercholesterolemia diagnosis (OR = 5.55 CI 95% 2.69-11.44, p. < 0.001) were independently associated with peripheral arterial disease. Among familial hypercholesterolemia patients, age (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09, p = 0.005), intermittent claudication (OR 6.32, 95% CI 2.60-15.33, p. < 0.001) and smoking (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.08-5.52, p = 0.032) were associated with peripheral arterial disease. Conclusions: Peripheral arterial disease is more frequent in familial hypercholesterolemia than in normolipidemic subjects and it should routine screened in these individuals even if asymptomatic. However, its role as predictor of cardiovascular events needs to be ascertained prospectively. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Atherosclerosis; Familial hypercholesterolemia; Peripheral artery disease,antilipemic agent; cholesterol; creatinine; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein receptor; genetic marker; adult; ankle brachial index; Article; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diastolic blood pressure; disease association; familial hypercholesterolemia; female; glucose blood level; heart muscle revascularization; heterozygosity; human; intermittent claudication; major clinical study; male; middle aged; molecular diagnosis; observational study; peripheral occlusive artery disease; prevalence; priority journal; propensity score; sex difference; smoking; adverse effects; age; Brazil; case control study; chi square distribution; comorbidity; genetic marker; genetic predisposition; genetics; heterozygote; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; odds ratio; pathophysiology; Peripheral Arterial Disease; prospective study; register; risk assessment; risk factor; statistical model; Adult; Age Factors; Ankle Brachial Index; Brazil; Case-Control Studies; Chi-Square Distribution; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Genetic Markers; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Heterozygote; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Prevalence; Propensity Score; Prospective Studies; Registries; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Smoking
Roberto Kalil Filho,Alterations in lipid transfers to HDL associated with the presence of coronary artery disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,2015,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939162770&doi=10.1186%2fs12933-015-0270-8&partnerID=40&md5=b23fac041f8a00ec8ec6e6490d183f2a,Universidade de Sâo Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Background: We previously showed that unesterified-cholesterol transfer to high-density lipoprotein (HDL), a crucial step in cholesterol esterification and role in reverse cholesterol transport, was diminished in non-diabetic patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim was to investigate whether, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the occurrence of CAD was also associated with alterations in lipid transfers and other parameters of plasma lipid metabolism. Methods: Seventy-nine T2DM with CAD and 76 T2DM without CAD, confirmed by cineangiography, paired for sex, age (40-80 years), BMI and without statin use, were studied. In vitro transfer of four lipids to HDL was performed by incubating plasma of each patient with a donor emulsion containing radioactive lipids during 1 h at 37 °C. Lipids transferred to HDL were measured after chemical precipitation of non-HDL fractions and the emulsion. Results are expressed as % of total radioactivity of each lipid in HDL. Results: In T2DM + CAD, LDL-cholesterol and apo B were higher than in T2DM. T2DM + CAD also showed diminished transfer to HDL of unesterified cholesterol (T2DM + CAD = 7.6 ± 1.2; T2DM = 8.2 ± 1.5 %, p < 0.01) and of cholesteryl-esters (4.0 ± 0.6 vs 4.3 ± 0.7, p < 0.01). Unesterified cholesterol in the non-HDL serum fraction was higher in T2DM + CAD (0.93 ± 0.20 vs 0.85 ± 0.15, p = 0.02) and CETP concentration was diminished (2.1 ± 1.0 vs 2.5 ± 1.1, p = 0.02). Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity, HDL size and lipid composition were equal. Conclusion: Reduction in T2DM + CAD of cholesterol transfer to HDL may impair cholesterol esterification and reverse cholesterol transport and altogether with simultaneous increased plasma unesterified cholesterol may facilitate CAD development in T2DM. © 2015 Sprandel et al.",Cholesterol; Coronary artery disease; HDL; High-density lipoprotein; Lipid transfers; Nanoparticles; Type 2 diabetes,"apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein B; cholesterol; cholesterol ester; cholesterol ester transfer protein; high density lipoprotein; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; phosphatidylcholine sterol acyltransferase; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; unesterified cholesterol; APOB protein, human; apolipoprotein B100; biological marker; cholesterol ester; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; nanoparticle; adult; aged; Article; body mass; case control study; cholesterol blood level; cholesterol esterification; cholesterol transport; cineangiocardiography; comparative study; controlled study; coronary artery disease; disease association; enzyme activity; female; human; in vitro study; incubation temperature; incubation time; lipid composition; lipid transport; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; particle size; precipitation; reverse cholesterol transport; blood; cineangiography; complication; coronary artery disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Angiopathies; Dyslipidemias; middle aged; risk factor; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Apolipoprotein B-100; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Cholesterol Esters; Cholesterol, LDL; Cineangiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Angiopathies; Dyslipidemias; Female; Humans; Lipoproteins, HDL; Male; Middle Aged; Nanoparticles; Particle Size; Risk Factors"

Objective: To assess the use of resources and real costs stratified by risk factors of patients submitted to surgical cardiac procedures and to compare them with the values reimbursed by the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Method: All cardiac surgery procedures performed between January and July 2013 in a tertiary referral center were analyzed. Demographic and clinical data allowed the calculation of the value reimbursed by the Brazilian SUS. Patients were stratified as low, intermediate and high-risk categories according to the EuroSCORE. Clinical outcomes, use of resources and costs (real costs versus SUS) were compared between established risk groups. Results: Postoperative mortality rates of low, intermediate and high-risk EuroSCORE risk strata showed a significant linear positive correlation (EuroSCORE: 3.8%, 10%, and 25%; p < 0.0001), as well as occurrence of any postoperative complication (EuroSCORE: 13.7%, 20.7%, and 30.8%, respectively; p = 0.006). Accordingly, length-of-stay increased from 20.9 days to 24.8 and 29.2 days (p < 0.001). The real cost was parallel to increased resource use according to EuroSCORE risk strata (R$ 27.116,00 ± R$ 13.928,00 versus R$ 34.854,00 ± R$ 27.814,00 versus R$ 43.234,00 ± R$ 26.009,00, respectively; p < 0.001). SUS reimbursement also increased (R$ 14.306,00 ± R$ 4.571,00 versus R$ 16.217,00 ± R$ 7.298,00 versus R$ 19.548,00 ± R$935,00; p < 0.001). However, as the EuroSCORE increased, there was significant difference (p < 0.0001) between the real cost increasing slope and the SUS reimbursement elevation per EuroSCORE risk strata. Conclusion: Higher EuroSCORE was related to higher postoperative mortality, complications, length of stay, and costs. Although SUS reimbursement increased according to risk, it was not proportional to real costs. © 2015, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

Materials and Methods: 143 patients with type 2 diabetes not taking anti-lipidemic drugs were separated into 2 groups: group A included 62 patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA<inf>1c</inf>)≤6.5% (48mmol/mol) and group B 81 patients with HbA<inf>1c</inf>>6.5%. In vitro transfer of lipids was determined by 1h incubation of a donor nanoemulsion containing radioactively labeled unesterified and esterified cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides with whole plasma followed by chemical precipitation and radioactive counting in the supernatant (HDL). Results: LDL and HDL cholesterol were similar in Group A and B, but group B had higher triglycerides (2.31±1.30 vs. 1.58±0.61mmol/l, P<0.0001) and total and non-HDL unesterified cholesterol (36.3±7.8 vs. 33.9±5.9mmol/l, P<0,05; 30.6±7.9 vs. 27.6±6.2mmol/l, P<0,05; respectively) than group A and a non-significant trend to increased apolipoprotein B (103±20 vs. 97±20mg/dl, P=0.08). 36 patients with the highest, ≥8.0% (64mmol/mol), HbA<inf>1c</inf> also showed non-significant trend of elevated non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) compared to 37 with lowest, ≤6.0% (42mmol/mol), HbA<inf>1c</inf> (P=0.08). Patients with higher NEFA had higher triglycerides than those with lower NEFA levels (P<0.01).Transfers of all lipids from nanoemulsion to HDL and lipid composition of HDL were equal in both groups. Conclusions: For the first time it was shown that in addition to triglycerides, unesterified cholesterol is also a marker of poor glycemic control. In vitro HDL lipid transfers, an important aspect of HDL metabolism, were not related with the glycemic control. J. A.

Roberto Kalil Filho,Comparison between MDCT and grayscale IVUS in a quantitative analysis of coronary lumen in segments with or without atherosclerotic plaques,2015,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929297724&doi=10.5935%2fabc.20140211&partnerID=40&md5=1dd92d8b8314ea566bc545f912cb3847,Universidade de Sâo Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Background: The diagnostic accuracy of 64-slice MDCT in comparison with IVUS has been poorly described and is mainly restricted to reports analyzing segments with documented atherosclerotic plaques. Objectives: We compared 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) with gray scale intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) for the evaluation of coronary lumen dimensions in the context of a comprehensive analysis, including segments with absent or mild disease. Methods: The 64-slice MDCT was performed within 72 h before the IVUS imaging, which was obtained for at least one coronary, regardless of the presence of luminal stenosis at angiography. A total of 21 patients were included, with 70 imaged vessels (total length 114.6 ± 38.3 mm per patient). A coronary plaque was diagnosed in segments with plaque burden > 40%. Results: At patient, vessel, and segment levels, average lumen area, minimal lumen area, and minimal lumen diameter were highly correlated between IVUS and 64-slice MDCT (p < 0.01). However, 64-slice MDCT tended to underestimate the lumen size with a relatively wide dispersion of the differences. The comparison between 64-slice MDCT and IVUS lumen measurements was not substantially affected by the presence or absence of an underlying plaque. In addition, 64-slice MDCT showed good global accuracy for the detection of IVUS parameters associated with flow-limiting lesions. Conclusions: In a comprehensive, multi-territory, and whole-artery analysis, the assessment of coronary lumen by 64-slice MDCT compared with coronary IVUS showed a good overall diagnostic ability, regardless of the presence or absence of underlying atherosclerotic plaques. © 2015, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

Classical measurements rely on reference to segments at a distance, risking inappropriate comparison between dislike vessel portions. Objective: to explore a new method for quantifying vessel remodeling, based on the comparison between a given target segment and its inferred normal dimensions. Methods: Geometric parameters and plaque composition were determined in 67 patients using three-vessel intravascular ultrasound with virtual histology (IVUS-VH). Coronary vessel remodeling at cross-section (n = 27.639) and lesion (n = 618) levels was assessed using classical metrics and a novel analytic algorithm based on the fractional vessel remodeling index (FVRI), which quantifies the total change in arterial wall dimensions related to the estimated normal dimension of the vessel. A prediction model was built to estimate the normal dimension of the vessel for calculation of FVRI. Results: According to the new algorithm, “Ectatic” remodeling pattern was least common, “Complete compensatory” remodeling was present in approximately half of the instances, and “Negative” and “Incomplete compensatory” remodeling types were detected in the remaining. Compared to a traditional diagnostic scheme, FVRI-based classification seemed to better discriminate plaque composition by IVUS-VH. Conclusions: Quantitative assessment of coronary remodeling using target segment dimensions offers a promising approach to evaluate the vessel response to plaque growth/regression. © 2015 Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

The proposed treatments for women are similar to those for men. However, in women with multivessel stable coronary artery disease and normal left ventricular function, the best treatment is unknown.METHODS: A post hoc analysis of the MASS II study with 10 years of follow-up, mean (standard deviation) 6.8 (3.7) years, enrolled between May 1995 and May 2000, evaluated 188 women with chronic stable multivessel coronary artery disease who underwent medical treatment, percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Primary end-points were incidence of total mortality, Q-wave myocardial infarction, or refractory angina. Data were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle.RESULTS: Women treated with percutaneous coronary intervention and medical treatment had more primary events than those treated with coronary artery bypass graft surgery, respectively, of 34, 44 and 22% (P = 0.003). Survival rates at 10 years were 72% for coronary artery bypass graft surgery, 72% for percutaneous coronary intervention and 56% for medical treatment (P = 0.156). For the composite end-point, Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, diabetes, hypertension, treatment allocation, prior myocardial infarction, smoking, number of vessels affected and total cholesterol, had a higher incidence of primary events with medical treatment than with coronary artery bypass graft surgery [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.38 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.40-4.05); P = 0.001], a lower incidence with percutaneous coronary intervention than with medical treatment [HR = 0.60 (95% CI: 0.38-0.95); P = 0.031] but no differences between coronary artery bypass graft surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention. Regarding death, a protective effect was observed with percutaneous coronary intervention compared with medical treatment [HR = 0.44 (95% CI: 0.21-0.90); P = 0.025].CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft surgery compared with medical treatment had better results after 10 years of follow-up. © The Author 2014.

Methods and results: Three hundred and seventeen consecutive patients of an ongoing electronic database protocol were evaluated by resting electrocardiogram and 142 were randomly selected for 24 h Holter monitoring for arrhythmia and conduction disturbances. The mean age was 40.2 ± 12.1 years and disease duration was 11.4 ± 8.1 years. Chloroquine (CQ) therapy was identified in 69.7 with a mean use of 8.5 ± 6.7 years. Electrocardiogram abnormalities were detected in 66 patients (20.8): prolonged QTc/QTd (14.2); bundle-branch block (2.5); and atrioventricular block (AVB) (1.6). Age was associated with AVB (P 0.029) and prolonged QTc/QTd (P 0.039) whereas anti-Ro/SS-A and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores were not (P > 0.05). Chloroquine was negatively associated with AVB (P 0.01) as was its longer use (6.1 ± 6.9 vs. 1.0 ± 2.5 years, P 0.018). Time of CQ use was related with the absence of AVB [odds ratio (OR) 0.103; 95 confidence interval (CI) 0.011-0.934, P 0.043] in multiple logistic regression. Holter monitoring revealed abnormalities in 121 patients (85.2): supraventricular ectopies (63.4) and tachyarrhythmia (18.3); ventricular ectopies (45.8). Atrial tachycardia/fibrillation (AT/AF) were associated with shorter CQ duration (7.05 ± 7.99 vs. 3.63 ± 5.02 years, P 0.043) with a trend to less CQ use (P 0.054), and older age (P < 0.001). Predictors of AT/AF in multiple logistic regression were age (OR 1.115; 95 CI 1.059-1.174, P < 0.001) and anti-Ro/SS-A (OR 0.172; 95 CI 0.047-0.629, P 0.008). Conclusions: Chloroquine seems to play a protective role in the unexpected high rate of cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disturbances observed in SLE. Further studies are necessary to determine if this antiarrhythmic effect is due to the disease control or a direct effect of the drug.

Secondary analyses evaluated the association between hyperglycemia and precordial pain at presentation, and the subgroup of patients presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset.Methods: We analyzed a prospectively designed registry of 3,544 patients with ACS admitted to a Coronary Care Unit of a tertiary hospital. We developed multivariable models to adjust for potential confounders.Results: Patients with precordial pain were less likely to have DM (30.3%) than those without pain (34.0%; unadjusted p = 0.029), but this difference was not significant after multivariable adjustment, for the global population (p = 0.84), and for subset of patients that presented within 6 hours from symptom onset (p = 0.51). In contrast, precordial pain was more likely among patients with hyperglycemia (41.2% vs 37.0% without hyperglycemia, p = 0.035) in the overall population and also among those who presented within 6 hours (41.6% vs. 32.3%, p = 0.001). Adjusted models showed an independent association between hyperglycemia and pain at presentation, especially among patients who presented within 6 hours (OR = 1.41, p = 0.008).Conclusion: In this non-selected ACS population, there was no correlation between DM and hospital presentation without precordial pain. Moreover, hyperglycemia correlated significantly with pain at presentation, especially in the population that arrived within 6 hours from symptom onset. © 2014, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

Roberto Kalil Filho,Intravascular ultrasound guidance to minimize the use of iodine contrast in percutaneous coronary intervention the MOZART (minimizing contrast utilization with IVUS guidance in coronary angioplasty) randomized controlled trial,2014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84922526930&doi=10.1016%2fj.jcin.2014.05.024&partnerID=40&md5=5e77c14aa7aaddcd2f89b63014e9ee84,Universidade de Sâo Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance on the final volume of contrast agent used in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND To date, few approaches have been described to reduce the final dose of contrast agent in PCIs. We hypothesized that IVUS might serve as an alternative imaging tool to angiography in many steps during PCI, thereby reducing the use of iodine contrast. METHODS A total of 83 patients were randomized to angiography-guided PCI or IVUS-guided PCI; both groups were treated according to a pre-defined meticulous procedural strategy. The primary endpoint was the total volume contrast agent used during PCI. Patients were followed clinically for an average of 4 months. RESULTS The median total volume of contrast was 64.5 ml (interquartile range [IQR]: 42.8 to 97.0 ml; minimum, 19 ml; maximum, 170 ml) in the angiography-guided group versus 20.0 ml (IQR: 12.5 to 30.0 ml; minimum, 3 ml; maximum, 54 ml) in the IVUS-guided group (p < 0.001). Similarly, the median volume of contrast/creatinine clearance ratio was significantly lower among patients treated with IVUS-guided PCI (1.0 [IQR: 0.6 to 1.9] vs. 0.4 [IQR: 0.2 to 0.6, respectively; p < 0.001). In-hospital and 4-month outcomes were not different between patients randomized to angiography-guided and IVUS-guided PCI. CONCLUSIONS Thoughtful and extensive use of IVUS as the primary imaging tool to guide PCI is safe and markedly reduces the volume of iodine contrast compared with angiography-alone guidance. The use of IVUS should be considered for patients at high risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury or volume overload undergoing coronary angioplasty. © 2014 By The American College of Cardiology Foundation Published by Elsevier Inc.",Contrast; Coronary intravascular ultrasound; Renal failure; Stent,"creatinine; iodixanol; iopromide; biological marker; contrast medium; creatinine; iodixanol; iodobenzoic acid derivative; iohexol; iopromide; adult; aged; angiography; Article; contrast induced acute kidney injury; contrast induced nephropathy; controlled study; creatinine clearance; female; human; intravascular ultrasound; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; percutaneous coronary intervention; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; ultrasound scanner; Acute Kidney Injury; adverse effects; analogs and derivatives; angiocardiography; blood; chemically induced; comparative study; coronary artery disease; diagnostic use; echography; endoscopic echography; middle aged; percutaneous coronary intervention; procedures; radiography; risk factor; time; Acute Kidney Injury; Aged; Biological Markers; Contrast Media; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Creatinine; Female; Humans; Iohexol; Male; Middle Aged; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Triiodobenzoic Acids; Ultrasonography, Interventional"

Methods: Prospective study with consecutive patients with stable angina or low-to-moderate risk acute coronary syndrome. We compared patients with an early removal of the arterial sheath to those whose sheath removal was based on a standard protocol. Results: The early removal group (n = 149) had lower access manipulation time than the conventional group (58.3 ± 21.4 minutes vs. 355.0 ± 62.9 minutes; p < 0.01), mainly due to a reduced time to sheath removal (42.3 ± 21.1 minutes vs. 338.6 ± 61.5 minutes; p < 0.01), with no impact on the duration of femoral compression (16.0 ± 3.6 minutes vs. 16.4 ± 5.1 minutes; p = 0.49). There was no stent thrombosis during hospitalization and no significant differences in the incidence of major vascular or bleeding events. The incidence of other bleeding events leading to prolonged hospitalization time was lower in the group with early removal (1.3% vs. 5.1%; p = 0.05). Conclusions: The selective use of an approach for immediate femoral sheath removal, based on activated clotting time guidance and protamine administration, is safe and effective in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention by femoral access.",Anticoagulants; Femoral artery; Heparin; Percutaneous coronary intervention; Protamines; Radial artery,protamine; acute coronary syndrome; article; bleeding; blood clotting time; controlled study; femoral artery; human; length of stay; major clinical study; nursing protocol; patient safety; percutaneous coronary intervention; prospective study; risk assessment; sheath removal; stable angina pectoris; time

However, its diagnostic performance in higher-risk patients has not been investigated in a large international multicenter trial. Therefore, in the present study we sought to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of MDCTA to detect significant coronary stenosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).Methods Patients included in the CORE64 study were categorized as suspected-ACS or non-ACS based on clinical data. A 64-row coronary MDCTA was performed before invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and both exams were evaluated by blinded, independent core laboratories.Results From 371 patients included, 94 were categorized as suspected ACS and 277 as non-ACS. Patient-based analysis showed an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) for detecting ≥ 50% coronary stenosis of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.88-0.98) in ACS and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.95) in non-ACS group (P = 0.29). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of MDCTA were 0.90(0.80-0.96), 0.88(0.70-0.98), 0.95(0.87-0.99) and 0.77(0.58-0.90) in suspected ACS patients and 0.87(0.81-0.92), 0.86(0.79-0.92), 0.91(0.85-0.95) and 0.82(0.74-0.89) in non-ACS patients (P NS for all comparisons). The mean calcium scores (CS) were 282 ± 449 in suspected ACS and 435 ± 668 in non-ACS group. The accuracy of CS to detect significant coronary stenosis was only moderate and the absence or minimal coronary artery calcification could not exclude the presence of significant coronary stenosis, particularly in ACS patients.Conclusions The diagnostic accuracy of MDCTA to detect significant coronary stenosis is high and comparable for both ACS and non-ACS patients. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of this study was to address the late outcome of DES versus BMS for the treatment of SVG lesions. Methods A matched, case-control study included 82 patients in each group. Patients groups were matched by gender, age, clinical presentation, and diabetes. The primary study end point was occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Secondary end points included death, cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target vessel revascularization (TVR). Results Clinical and angiographic characteristics were similar between the groups. At 6 months, TVR (hazard ratio [HR] 6.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39 to 26.93, P = 0.05), and MACE (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.98, P = 0.04) were higher in the BMS group. At 4 years the risks of MI (P = 0.21), TVR (P = 0.99), and MACE (P = 0.21) were similar between both groups. However, the rates of death (HR 2.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 6.74, P = 0.04) and cardiac death (HR 4.26, 95% CI 1.59 to 11.35, P = 0.01) were significantly higher in the BMS group. Conclusions These results suggest that the use of DES compared with BMS in the treatment of SVG lesions reduces TVR and MACE at 6 months of follow-up, a benefit that was lost over the next 3-4 years.

However, the role of bleeding risk score as mortality predictor is poorly studied. Objective: The main purpose of this paper was to analyze the role of bleeding risk score as in-hospital mortality predictor in a cohort of patients with ACS treated in a single cardiology tertiary center. Methods: Out of 1,655 patients with ACS (547 with ST-elevation ACS and 1,118 with non-ST-elevation ACS), we calculated the ACUITY/HORIZONS bleeding score prospectively in 249 patients and retrospectively in the remaining 1,416. Mortality information and hemorrhagic complications were also obtained. Results: Among the mean age of 64.3 ± 12.6 years, the mean bleeding score was 18 ± 7.7. The correlation between bleeding and mortality was highly significant (p < 0.001, OR = 5.296), as well as the correlation between bleeding score and in-hospital bleeding (p < 0.001, OR = 1.058), and between bleeding score and in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR = 1.121, p < 0.001, area under the ROC curve 0.753, p < 0.001). The adjusted OR and area under the ROC curve for the population with ST-elevation ACS were, respectively, 1.046 (p = 0.046) and 0.686 ± 0.040 (p < 0.001); for non-ST-elevation ACS the figures were, respectively, 1.150 (p < 0.001) and 0.769 ± 0.036 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Bleeding risk score is a very useful and highly reliable predictor of in-hospital mortality in a wide range of patients with acute coronary syndromes, especially in those with unstable angina or non-ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction.",Acute coronary syndrome/complications; Hemorrhage/mortality; Probability,Acute Coronary Syndrome; Adult; Aged; Angioplasty; Brazil; Female; Fibrinolytic Agents; Hemorrhage; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; ROC Curve

Although patients aged 65 years or more have been referred to surgical or percutaneous coronary interventions, the best option for coronary artery disease treatment remains uncertain. The current study compared the 3 treatment options for coronary artery disease in patients aged 65 years or more and analyzed the impact of age in treatment options. Methods: Patients were separated according to age: 65 years or more (n = 200) and less than 65 years (n = 411). All patients were followed for 10 years. The rates of overall mortality, acute myocardial infarction, and new revascularizations were analyzed. Results: Of 200 patients aged 65 years or more, 68 were randomized to medical therapy, 68 were randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention, and 64 were randomized to coronary artery bypass grafting. At 10 years, overall survival was 63% (medical therapy), 69% (percutaneous coronary intervention), and 66% (coronary artery bypass grafting) (P =.93). The survival free of combined events was 43% (medical therapy), 38% (percutaneous coronary intervention), and 66% (coronary artery bypass grafting) (P =.007). The survival free of myocardial infarction was 82% (medical therapy), 77% (percutaneous coronary intervention), and 90% (coronary artery bypass grafting) (P =.17), and survival free of new revascularizations was 59% (medical therapy), 58% (percutaneous coronary intervention), and 91% (coronary artery bypass grafting) (P =.0003). When the 2 age groups were compared, survival free of myocardial infarction for patients treated by percutaneous coronary intervention was 77% (older patients) and 92% (younger patients) (P =.004). Conclusions: In this analysis, treatment options for patients aged 65 years or more who have coronary artery disease yield similar overall survival. However, coronary artery bypass grafting was associated with fewer coronary events, and percutaneous coronary intervention was associated with a higher incidence of myocardial infarction.

There is no conclusive evidence that either modality is better than medical therapy alone for the treatment of stable multivessel CAD in patients with diabetes in a very long-term follow-up. Our aim was to compare 3 therapeutic strategies for stable multivessel CAD in a diabetic population and non-diabetic population. Methods It was compared medical therapy (MT), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in 232 diabetic patients and 379 nondiabetic patients with multivessel CAD. Endpoints evaluated were overall and cardiac mortality. Results Patients (n = 611) were randomized to CABG (n = 203), PCI (n = 205), or MT (n = 203). In a 10-year follow-up, more deaths occurred among patients with diabetes than among patients without diabetes (P =.001) for overall mortality. In this follow-up, 10-year mortality rates were 32.3% and 23.2% for diabetics and non-diabetics respectively (P =.024). Regarding cardiac mortality, 10-year cardiac mortality rates were 19.4% and 12.7% respectively (P =.031).Considering only diabetic patients and stratifying this population by treatment option, we found mortality rates of 31.3% for PCI, 27.5% for CABG and 37.5% for MT (P =.015 for CABG vs MT) and cardiac mortality rates of 18.8%, 12.5% and 26.1% respectively (P =.005 for CABG vs MT). Conclusions/ interpretation Among patients with stable multivessel CAD and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, the 3 therapeutic regimens had high rates of overall and cardiac-related deaths among diabetic compared with non-diabetic patients. Moreover, better outcomes were observed in diabetic patients undergoing CABG compared to MT in relation to overall and cardiac mortality in a 10-year follow-up. © 2013 Mosby, Inc.",,"acetylsalicylic acid; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; nitrate; adult; article; cardiovascular mortality; controlled study; coronary artery bypass graft; coronary artery disease; coronary stent; diabetes mellitus; directional atherectomy; excimer laser; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; percutaneous coronary intervention; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; priority journal; prognosis; randomized controlled trial; rotablator; Aged; Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary; Coronary Artery Bypass; Coronary Artery Disease; Diabetes Complications; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Prognosis"

Roberto Kalil Filho,Exercise-induced decrease in myocardial high-energy phosphate metabolites in patients with Chagas heart disease.,2013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894487167&partnerID=40&md5=5702473db439b3e5a6640143d51e690c,Universidade de Sâo Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"The influence of exercise on cardiac metabolic response in patients with Chagas disease is incompletely understood. Changes in cardiac energetic metabolism were investigated in Chagas disease patients before and during isometric handgrip exercise with (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Twenty-eight patients (10 with systolic dysfunction: group I; 10 with normal systolic function and electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities: group II; and 8 asymptomatic without ECG abnormalities: group III) and 8 healthy control subjects (group C) were evaluated by electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, functional tests for coronary artery disease, and image-selected localized cardiac (31)P-MRS. The myocardial phosphocreatine to [β-phosphate]adenosine triphosphate ratio (PCr/β-ATP) was measured at rest and during isometric handgrip exercise. Exercise testing or 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy were negative for myocardial ischemia in all individuals. At rest, cardiac PCr/β-ATP was decreased in all Chagas groups (1.23 ± 0.37) versus group C (1.88 ± 0.08; P < .001) and was lower in group I (0.89 ± 0.24) versus groups II (1.44 ± 0.23) and III (1.40 ± 0.37; P < .001). There was no stress-induced change in cardiac PCr/β-ATP (1.88 ± 0.08 at rest vs 1.89 ± 0.08 during exercise; P = NS) in group C. Mean cardiac PCr/β-ATP was 0.89 ± 0.24 and 0.56 ± 0.21 at rest and during exercise, respectively, in group I (37% decrease; P < .001). In group II, PCr/β-ATP was 1.44 ± 0.23 at rest and 0.97 ± 0.37 during exercise (33% decrease; P < .001). In group III, PCr/β-ATP was 1.40 ± 0.37 at rest and 0.60 ± 0.19 during exercise (57% decrease; P < .001). Myocardial high-energy phosphates are reduced at rest in Chagas heart disease patients, and the reduction is greater in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Regardless of left ventricular function, Chagas patients exhibit an exercise-induced decline in cardiac high-energy phosphates consistent with myocardial ischemia, suggesting the possibility that this metabolic approach may offer a tool to probe new interventions in Chagas disease patients.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We performed a prospective study of 96 consecutive patients allocated into two groups: 42 to group repaglinide (R) and 54 to group vildagliptin (V). All patients underwent two consecutive exercise tests (ET1 and ET2) in phase 1 without drugs. In phase 2, 1 day after ET1 and -2, 2 mg repaglinide three times daily or 50 mg vildagliptin twice daily was given orally to patients in the respective group for 6 days. On the seventh day, 60 min after 6 mg repaglinide or 100 mg vildagliptin, all patients underwent two consecutive exercise tests (ET3 and ET4). RESULTS - In phase 1, IPC was demonstrated by improvement in the time to 1.0 mm ST-segment depression and rate pressure product (RPP). All patients developed ischemia in ET3; however, 83.3% of patients in group R experienced ischemia earlier in ET4, without significant improvement in RPP, indicating the cessation of IPC (P &lt; 0.0001). In group V, only 28% of patients demonstrated IPC cessation, with 72% still having the protective effect (P &lt; 0.0069). CONCLUSIONS - Repaglinide eliminatedmyocardial IPC, probably by its effect on the KATP channel. Vildagliptin did not damage this protective mechanismin a relevant way in patients with type 2 diabetes and CAD, suggesting a good alternative treatment in this population. © 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.",,"repaglinide; vildagliptin; adult; article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; coronary artery disease; drug effect; exercise test; female; heart muscle ischemia; human; ischemic preconditioning; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; prospective study; ST segment depression; Adamantane; Aged; Carbamates; Coronary Artery Disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Ischemic Preconditioning; Male; Middle Aged; Nitriles; Piperidines; Prospective Studies; Pyrrolidines"

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of qualitative and quantitative analyses obtained by RTMPE in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. Methods: From March 2003 to December 2008, 227 consecutive patients with normal left ventricular function who underwent RTMPE were prospectively studied. Replenishment velocity reserve (β) and myocardial blood flow reserve were derived from RTMPE. Primary outcomes were cardiac death, myocardial infarction and unstable angina with need for urgent coronary revascularization, and secondary outcomes were coronary bypass graft surgery or angioplasty. Results: During a median follow-up period of 32 months (range, 5 days to 6.9 years), 19 major events (two deaths, six myocardial infarctions, and 11 episodes of unstable angina) and 46 total events occurred. Wall motion (hazard ratio [HR], 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.6; P =.003) and qualitative myocardial perfusion analysis (HR, 4.3; 95% CI, 2.1-8.5; P &lt;.001) were predictors of total events but not primary events. Abnormal myocardial blood flow reserve and abnormal β reserve were predictors of total events (HR, 8.1; 95% CI, 3-21; P &lt;.001; and HR, 16.5; 95% CI, 5.5-49; P &lt;.001) and primary events (HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1-15; P = .048; and HR, 8.7; 95% CI, 1.8-40; P =.005). On multivariate analysis, only abnormal β reserve was an independent predictor of total (HR, 10.6; 95% CI, 2.5-43; P =.001) and primary (HR, 10.5; 95% CI, 1.5-6; P =.015) events. Abnormal β reserve added incremental value in predicting primary events (χ2 = 2.0-13.2; P =.014).

Objective: The aim was to investigate whether MF detected by delayed enhancement cardiac CT is predictive of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF) that require appropriate therapy by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in patients with HCM. Methods: Twenty-six patients with HCM with previously (for at least 1 year) implanted ICD underwent MF evaluation by cardiac CT. MF was quantified by myocardial delayed enhanced cardiac CT. Data on ICD firing were recorded every 3 months after ICD implantation. Risk factors for sudden cardiac death in patients with HCM were evaluated in all patients. Results: MF was present in 25 of 26 patients (96%) with mean fibrosis mass of 20.5 ± 15.8 g. Patients with appropriate ICD shocks for VF/VT had significantly greater MF mass than patients without (29.10 ± 19.13 g vs 13.57 ± 8.31 g; P= .01). For a MF mass of at least 18 g, sensitivity and specificity for appropriate ICD firing were 73% (95% CI, 49%-88%) and 71% (95% CI, 56%-81%), respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves indicated a significantly greater VF/VT event rate in patients with MF mass ≥18 g than in patients with MF <18 g (P= .02). In the Cox regression analysis, the amount of MF was independently associated with VF/VT in ICD-stored electrograms. Conclusion: The mass of MF detected by cardiac CT in patients with HCM at high risk of sudden death was associated with appropriate ICD firings. © 2013 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography.",Delayed enhancement cardiac computed tomography; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Implantable cardiac defibrillator; Myocardial fibrosis; Ventricular arrhythmias,"adult; article; cardiac computer assisted tomography; cardiovascular risk; computed tomography scanner; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic test accuracy study; follow up; heart muscle fibrosis; heart ventricle fibrillation; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; image analysis; image enhancement; implantable cardioverter defibrillator; major clinical study; multidetector computed tomography; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; Delayed enhancement cardiac computed tomography; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Implantable cardiac defibrillator; Myocardial fibrosis; Ventricular arrhythmias; Adolescent; Adult; Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic; Contrast Media; Defibrillators, Implantable; Endomyocardial Fibrosis; Female; Humans; Iopamidol; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Risk Factors; ROC Curve; Tachycardia, Ventricular; Ventricular Fibrillation"

The aim of this study was to assess the value of coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) and real-time myocardial perfusion echocardiography (RTMPE) for predicting events in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Methods: One hundred ninety-five patients (mean age 54 ± 12 years; 66% men) with dilated cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 35% and no obstructive coronary disease on invasive angiography or multidetector computed tomography) who underwent dipyridamole stress (0.84 mg/kg over 10 min) RTMPE were prospectively studied. CFVR was calculated as the ratio of hyperemic to baseline peak diastolic velocities in the distal left anterior coronary artery. The replenishment velocity (β), plateau of acoustic intensity (AN), and myocardial blood flow reserve were obtained from RTMPE. Results: Mean CFVR was 2.07 ± 0.52, mean A N reserve was 1.05 ± 0.09, mean β reserve was 2.05 ± 0.39, and mean myocardial blood flow reserve (AN × β) was 2.15 ± 0.48. During a median follow-up period of 29 months, 45 patients had events (43 deaths and two urgent transplantations). Independent predictors of events were left atrial diameter (relative risk, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.26; P &lt;.001) and β reserve ≤ 2.0 (relative risk, 3.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-8.79; P &lt;.001). After adjustment for β reserve, CFVR and myocardial blood flow reserve no longer had predictive value. Left atrial diameter added prognostic value over clinical factors and left ventricular ejection fraction (χ2 = 36.8-58.5, P &lt;.001). Beta reserve added additional power to the model (χ2 = 70.2, P &lt;.001). Conclusions: Increased left atrial diameter and depressed β reserve were independent predictors of cardiac death and transplantation in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Beta reserve by RTMPE provided incremental predictive value beyond that provided by current known prognostic clinical and echocardiographic factors.Copyright 2013 by the American Society of Echocardiography.",Contrast echocardiography; Dilated cardiomyopathy; Myocardial blood flow reserve; Myocardial perfusion; Prognostic value,"adult; article; computer assisted tomography; congestive cardiomyopathy; contrast echocardiography; controlled study; coronary flow reserve; diastolic blood pressure; Doppler echocardiography; echocardiography; event free survival; female; follow up; heart death; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart muscle perfusion; heart transplantation; human; major clinical study; male; mitral valve regurgitation; myocardial perfusion imaging; predictive value; prognosis; real time myocardial perfusion echocardiography; sound intensity; systolic blood pressure; Analysis of Variance; Blood Flow Velocity; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated; Chi-Square Distribution; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Circulation; Exercise Test; Female; Heart Transplantation; Humans; Male; Microcirculation; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

ChHD is associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmias and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Although ChHD is a common form of cardiomyopathy in Latin American ICD users, little is known about its efficacy in the treatment of this population. The study cohort included 116 consecutive patients with ChHD and an ICD implanted for secondary prevention. Of the 116 patients, 83 (72%) were men; the mean age was 54 ± 10.7 years. Several clinical variables were tested in a multivariate Cox model for predicting long-term mortality. The average follow-up was 45 ± 32 months. New York Heart Association class I-II developed in 83% of patients. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 42 ± 16% at implantation. Of the 116 patients, 58 (50%) had appropriate shocks and 13 (11%) had inappropriate therapy. A total of 31 patients died (7.1% annual mortality rate). New York Heart Association class III (hazard ratio [HR] 3.09, 95% confidence interval 1.37 to 6.96, p = 0.0064) was a predictor of a worse prognosis. The left ventricular ejection fraction (HR 0.972, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 0.99, p = 0.0442) and low cumulative right ventricular pacing (HR 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.49, p = 0.0001) were predictors of better survival. The left ventricular diastolic diameter was an independent predictor of appropriate shock (HR 1.032, 95% confidence interval 1.004 to 1.060, p = 0.025). In conclusion, in a long-term follow-up, ICD efficacy for secondary sudden cardiac death prevention in patients with ChHD was marked by a favorable annual rate of all-cause mortality (7.1%); 50% of the cohort received appropriate shock therapy.

Background: TAVI with the Medtronic Corevalve (MCV) Revalving System (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) has been associated with important post-procedural conduction abnormalities and frequent need for PPM. Methods: Overall, 73 consecutive patients with severe symptomatic AS underwent TAVI with the MCV at two institutions; 10 patients with previous pacemaker and 3 patients with previous aortic valve replacement were excluded for this analysis. Clinical, echocardiographic, and procedural data were collected prospectively in a dedicated database. A standard 12-lead ECG was recorded in all patients at baseline, after the procedure and predischarge. Decision to implant PPM was taken according to current guidelines. Logistic multivariable modeling was applied to identify independent predictors of PPM at discharge. Results: Patients exhibited high-risk features as evidenced by advanced age (mean = 82.1 ± 6.2 years) and high surgical scores (logistic EuroSCORE 23.0 ± 12.8%, STS score 9.4 ± 6.9%). The incidence of new PPM was 28.3%. Interventricular septum thickness and logistic Euroscore were the baseline independent predictors of PPM. When procedural variables were included, the independent predictors of PPM were interventricular septum thickness (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.32-0.85) and the distance between noncoronary cusp and the distal edge of the prosthesis (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.03-1.83). Conclusions: Conduction abnormalities are frequently observed after TAVI with self-expandable bioprosthesis and definitive pacing is required in about a third of the patients, with a clear association with depth of implant and small interventricular septum thickness. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Aortic stenosis; Bioprosthesis; Cardiac conduction disorders; Electrocardiography,"aged; aorta stenosis; article; artificial heart pacemaker; atrioventricular block; bioprosthesis; cardiovascular parameters; controlled study; echocardiography; electrocardiogram; EuroSCORE; female; heart muscle conduction disturbance; high risk patient; human; incidence; interventricular septum thickness; major clinical study; male; prediction; scoring system; self expanding nitinol bioprosthesis; transcatheter aortic valve implantation; treatment indication; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alloys; Analysis of Variance; Aortic Valve Stenosis; Bioprosthesis; Cardiac Pacing, Artificial; Cohort Studies; Echocardiography, Doppler; Electrocardiography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Catheterization; Heart Valve Prosthesis; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Humans; Italy; Logistic Models; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Postoperative Complications; Predictive Value of Tests; Preoperative Care; Prospective Studies; Prosthesis Design; Risk Assessment; Severity of Illness Index; Surgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive; Survival Rate; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"

However, coronary segments with prior stent implantation visualized with CTA may have limited evaluation and reduced accuracy. Objective: We assessed the incremental value of stress myocardial CT perfusion (CTP) over anatomical assessment by coronary CTA alone in patients with stents, using quantitative invasive coronary angiography (≥50%) as reference. Methods: Forty-six patients (56.9 ± 7.2 years; 28 men) referred to invasive coronary angiography were evaluated, combining coronary CTA and dipyridamole stress myocardial CTP with 64 detector-row CT. Coronary CTA was evaluated for ≥50% coronary stenosis, and myocardial CTP was used to potentially reclassify coronary territories, including those with stents and poorly evaluated stents because of artifacts. Results: We evaluated 138 coronary territories, 62 with ≥1 stent. From these, 21 (34%) territories had adequately evaluated stents, 28 (45%) had limitedly evaluated stents still allowing diagnosis, and 13 (21%) had inadequately evaluated stents (no luminal assessment possible). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy for coronary CTA in stent territories were, respectively, 85%, 77%, 87%, 74%, and 81%, and the combined use of coronary CTA and myocardial CTP were 88%, 95%, 97%, 81%, and 91% (P = 0.0292). In territories with impaired stent evaluation (limited or inadequate), the diagnostic performance of coronary CTA alone was 83%, 72%, 79%, 76% and 77%, and combined with myocardial CTP were 87%, 94%, 95%, 85%, and 91% (P = 0.036). Conclusion: The combined evaluation of coronary CTA and stress myocardial CTP improved the diagnostic accuracy for the detection of significant obstructive CAD in patients with stents. © 2011 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography.",Coronary stents; Dipyridamole; Multidetector row computed tomography; Myocardial ischemia; Myocardial perfusion imaging,"dipyridamole; adult; angiography; article; artifact; cardiac patient; clinical article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; coronary artery obstruction; coronary stent; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; heart stress; human; male; multidetector computed tomography; myocardial perfusion imaging; predictive value; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary; Artifacts; Brazil; Chi-Square Distribution; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Circulation; Coronary Restenosis; Dipyridamole; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Perfusion Imaging; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stents; Tomography, Spiral Computed; Vasodilator Agents"

However, the eff ects of exercise therapy on cardiovascular function of these patients have been poorly studied. Th e aim of this study is to compare the eff ects of walking and strength training on cardiovascular responses assessed at rest and during exercise in patients with intermittent claudication. Patients and methods: Th irty-four patients with stable symptoms of intermittent claudication were randomized into two groups: strength training (ST) consisting of eight exercises, three sets of 10 repetitions, intensity of 11-13 on 15-grade Borg scale, 2-min interval between sets; and walking training (WT) consisting of walking on a treadmill, 15 bouts of 2-min, intensity of 11-13 on 15-grade Borg scale, with a 2-min interval between bouts. Before and aft er 12 weeks, blood pressure, heart rate and rate pressure product were measured at rest and during a progressive treadmill test until maximal claudication pain. Results: Fift een patients in each group completed the training program. Aft er the training programs, resting systolic blood pressure (ST:-6 ± 13 mmHg and WT:-3 ± 18 mmHg, P =.04), heart rate (ST:-6 ± 10 bpm and WT:-2 ± 9 bpm, P =.03), and rate pressure product (ST:-1485 ± 1442 mmHg*bpm and WT:-605 ± 2145 mmHg*bpm, P =.01) decreased signifi cantly and similarly in both groups. Submaximal systolic blood pressure (ST:-14 ± 23 mmHg and WT:-6 ± 23 mmHg, P =.02), and rate pressure product (ST:-1579 ± 3444 mmHg*bpm and WT:-1264 ± 3005 mmHg*bpm, P =.04) decreased signifi cantly and similarly in both groups. Th ere were no changes in submaximal heart rate aft er ST and WT. Maximal systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and rate pressure product did not change in either group, although maximal exercise time increased similarly in the ST and WT groups (+31 ± 19%, and +31 ± 32%, respectively, P <.01).

Background: Balloon pre-dilation of the stenosed aortic valve is currently believed to be a necessary step for valve preparation before device placement in patients undergoing TAVI and, therefore, is considered an obligatory part of the procedure. However, clear evidence supporting this policy is lacking. In contrast, pre-dilation might be responsible in part for distal embolizations as well as atrioventricular conduction disturbances seen during TAVI procedures. Methods: A total of 60 consecutive patients (mean age 80.1 ± 6.4 years, 53% female, mean logistic EuroScore 23.3 ± 15.2%) undergoing TAVI using the self-expanding Medtronic CoreValve prosthesis (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) have been prospectively enrolled at 13 international centers. Results: Pre-procedural mean transaortic valve gradient was 47.8 ± 15.5 mm Hg, mean effective orifice area was 0.67 ± 0.15 cm 2. Technical success rate was 96.7% (58 of 60) of patients. Post-dilation was performed in 16.7% (10 of 60) of patients. Post-procedural mean valve gradient was 4.4 ± 2.0 mm Hg. Circular and noncircular valve configuration was present in 41 and 19 cases (68.3% vs. 31.7%), respectively, with similar effective orifice areas (1.74 ± 0.10 cm 2 vs. 1.71 ± 0.22 cm 2, p = NS). In-hospital mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and major vascular complications occurred in 6.7% (4 of 60), 0%, 5%, and 10% of patients. There was no valve embolization. New permanent pacing was needed in 11.7% (7 of 60) of patients. Conclusions: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation without balloon pre-dilation is feasible and safe, resulting in similar acute safety and efficacy as the current standard approach of TAVI with pre-dilation. © 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",aortic valve stenosis; balloon pre-dilation; transcatheter aortic valve implantation,"aged; aorta valve prosthesis; aorta valve stenosis; article; balloon dilatation; clinical trial; feasibility study; female; heart infarction; human; major clinical study; male; mortality; multicenter study; patient safety; priority journal; stroke; transcatheter aortic valve implantation; treatment outcome; Aged, 80 and over; Aortic Valve Stenosis; Balloon Dilation; Echocardiography; Feasibility Studies; Female; Heart Catheterization; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Humans; Male; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Prosthesis Design; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome"

The aims of this study were to investigate the feasibility of the three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (3DSTE) to assess LV twist values and compare the data measured by two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2DSTE) in a group of healthy volunteers.Methods and resultsFifty individuals were enrolled in the protocol. LV twist was defined as net difference between averaged 2DSTE apical (4 segments) and basal (6 segments) rotations. 3DSTE twist was obtained from the LV volumetric image and shown as the averaged global value of 16 segments. Time-to-peak by both techniques was also measured and compared. Significant differences between the two techniques were calculated using the paired Student t-test. P-values of <0.05 were considered significant. Reliable LV twist measurement was possible in 39 of 50 individuals (78). 2DSTE twist mean peak value was 13.8 7.9° with a mean time-to-peak of 388.3 ± 152.3 ms and global 3DSTE twist mean peak value was 10.2 7.6° with a mean time-to-peak of 371.8 ± 127.5 ms. Peak LV twist values by 3DSTE was significantly smaller than by 2DSTE (P < 0.01) whereas time-to-peak results showed no significant difference.Conclusion3DSTE is feasible to assess LV twist deformation. Whereas further investigations using 3DSTE are needed to validate this promising technology, comparing 2DSTE and 3DSTE should be done with caution, as values for peak LV twist differ. © The Author 2010.",Echocardiography; Rotation; Speckle tracking; Twist,"adult; article; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; female; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle twist; heart left ventricle volume; human; human experiment; image analysis; intermethod comparison; male; normal human; priority journal; three dimensional echocardiography; two dimensional echocardiography; Adult; Echocardiography; Echocardiography, Three-Dimensional; Feasibility Studies; Female; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Male; Rotation; Ventricular Function, Left"

Objective: To define whether a restrictive perioperative red blood cell transfusion strategy is as safe as a liberal strategy in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Design, Setting, and Patients: The Transfusion Requirements After Cardiac Surgery (TRACS) study, a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical noninferiority trial conducted between February 2009 and February 2010 in an intensive care unit at a university hospital cardiac surgery referral center in Brazil. Consecutive adult patients (n=502) who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were eligible; analysis was by intention-to-treat. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned to a liberal strategy of blood transfusion (to maintain a hematocrit ≥30%) or to a restrictive strategy (hematocrit ≥24%). Main Outcome Measure: Composite end point of 30-day all-cause mortality and severe morbidity (cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or acute renal injury requiring dialysis or hemofiltration) occurring during the hospital stay. The noninferiority margin was predefined at -8% (ie, 8% minimal clinically important increase in occurrence of the composite end point). Results: Hemoglobin concentrations were maintained at a mean of 10.5 g/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.4-10.6) in the liberal-strategy group and 9.1 g/dL (95% CI, 9.0-9.2) in the restrictive-strategy group (P < .001). A total of 198 of 253 patients (78%) in the liberal-strategy group and 118 of 249 (47%) in the restrictive-strategy group received a blood transfusion (P < .001). Occurrence of the primary end point was similar between groups (10% liberal vs 11 % restrictive; between-group difference, 1% [95% CI,-6% to 4%]; P=.85). Independent of transfusion strategy, the number of transfused red blood cell units was an independent risk factor for clinical complications or death at 30 days (hazard ratio for each additional unit transfused, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.4]; P=.002). Conclusion: Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the use of a restrictive perioperative transfusion strategy compared with a more liberal strategy resulted in noninferior rates of the combined outcome of 30-day all-cause mortality and severe morbidity. ©2010 American Medical Association.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with phosphorus-31 is a noninvasive technique that allows detection of myocardial metabolic changes. Objective: To determine the resting metabolism of high-energy phosphates in patients with Chagas' disease (CD) by MRS with phosphorus-31. Methods: We studied 39 patients with CD, 23 with preserved ventricular function (PF Group) and 16 with ventricular dysfunction (VD Group), assessed by Doppler echocardiography. MRS of the anterosseptal region was performed in 39 patients and 8 normal subjects (C Group) through a Phillips 1.5 Tesla device, obtaining the phosphocreatine/beta-adenosine triphosphate myocardial ratio (PCr/β-ATP). Results: The levels of cardiac PCr/β-ATP were reduced in VD Group in relation to PF Group, and the latter presented reduced levels compared to C Group (VD Group: 0.89 ± 0.31 vs PF Group: 1.47 ± 0.34 vs C Group: 1.88 ± 0.08, p < 0.001).

Although effective and relatively safe, TAVI is currently associated to the need of permanent pacemaker in 20% to 30% of the cases, with a number of predictors of this complication already described in the literature. Method: We report a series of 8 consecutive patients with aortic stenosis treated with TAVI (Corevalve Revalving, Medtronic Inc., USA). Results: The study population had a high surgical risk (on average, STS Score = 22.9% and EuroSCORE = 27.2%). All cases presented at least one high-risk predictor for post-procedure high grade atrioventricular block. The interventional procedure was successfully accomplished in all but one patient who presented a cardiac tamponade and in-hospital death. The transaortic pressure gradient was reduced from 91.3 ± 26.9 mmHg to 19.4 ± 6.3 mmHg. After hospital discharge, the follow-up time ranged from 4 weeks to 12 months. During follow-up, there were no deaths and none of the patients had a new 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block and permanent pacemaker was not required in any of the cases. Conclusion: Although the lack of a permanent pacemaker in the study population may have occurred by chance, our initial experience suggests that the need of pacemaker following TAVI is not readily predictable with the currently described high-risk predictors.","Aortic valve stenosis; Catheterization; Heart block; Heart valve prosthesis; Pacemaker, artificial",aged; aorta pressure; aorta valve replacement; aorta valve stenosis; article; atrioventricular block; cardiovascular risk; clinical article; female; heart tamponade; human; intervention study; male; surgical risk; transcatheter aortic valve implantation

The purposes of this study were to use the myocardial delayed enhancement technique of cardiac MRI to investigate the frequency of unrecognized myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with end-stage renal disease, to compare the findings with those of ECG and SPECT, and to examine factors that may influence the utility of these methods in the detection of MI. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. We prospectively performed cardiac MRI, ECG, and SPECT to detect unrecognized MI in 72 patients with end-stage renal disease at high risk of coronary artery disease but without a clinical history of MI. RESULTS. Fifty-six patients (78%) were men (mean age, 56.2 ± 9.4 years) and 16 (22%) were women (mean age, 55.8 ± 11.4). The mean left ventricular mass index was 103.4 ± 27.3 g/m2, and the mean ejection fraction was 60.6% ± 15.5%. Myocardial delayed enhancement imaging depicted unrecognized MI in 18 patients (25%). ECG findings were abnormal in five patients (7%), and SPECT findings were abnormal in 19 patients (26%). ECG findings were false-negative in 14 cases and false-positive in one case. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of ECG were 79.2%, 22.2%, and 98.1% (p = 0.002). SPECT findings were false-negative in six cases and false-positive in seven cases. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of SPECT were 81.9%, 66.7%, and 87.0% (not significant). During a period of 4.9-77.9 months, 19 cardiac deaths were documented, but no statistical significance was found in survival analysis. CONCLUSION. Cardiac MRI with myocardial delayed enhancement can depict unrecognized MI in patients with end-stage renal disease. ECG and SPECT had low sensitivity in detection of MI. Infarct size and left ventricular mass can influence the utility of these methods in the detection of MI. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Coronary artery disease; ECG; Kidney transplantation; MRI; Myocardial infarction; Scintigraphy,"adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; gadoterate meglumine; methoxy isobutyl isonitrile technetium tc 99m; thallium 201; vasodilator agent; adult; angiocardiography; article; cardiovascular risk; clinical trial; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic procedure; electrocardiogram; female; follow up; heart death; heart ejection fraction; heart infarction; heart infarction size; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle mass; high risk patient; human; image enhancement; intermethod comparison; ischemic heart disease; kidney failure; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; prospective study; radiodiagnosis; sensitivity and specificity; single photon emission computer tomography; survival; chronic kidney failure; comparative study; electrocardiography; evaluation; heart infarction; methodology; middle aged; reproducibility; Electrocardiography; Female; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"

However, little is known on the long-term impact of these markers. Objective: To evaluate the short-and long-term influence of the levels of glucose and leukocytes on the prognosis of patients with AMI. Methods: A total of 809 patients with AMI were retrospectively assessed (mean age: 63.2±12.87 yrs) and prospectively and consecutively included in a specific database. Results: a) At the intrahospital phase, the mean values were compared between patients that died and those who survived: Leukocytosis: 12156±5977 vs 10337±3528 (p=0.004, 95%CI = 976-2663); Glucose 176±105 mg/dl vs 140±72 mg/dl (p<0.001, 95%CI = 19.4 - 52.6), respectively. b) With the adjusted mode, the same pattern was observed [p values: 0.002 (t-ratio 3.05), 0.04 (t-ratio 2.06), respectively]. c) Long-term follow-up: the univariate analysis showed P values of 0.001 (t-ratio 3.3), <0.001 (t-ratio 4.16), respectively.

Objective:To assess the outcome of patients with AMI who are covered by the National Health System (SUS) or other health insurance plans. Methods: We analyzed 1,588 patients with AMI (mean age of 63.3 + 12.9 years, 71.7% male) who were included prospectively into a specific database and followed up for up to 7.55 years. Of this total, 1,003 were placed in the ""SUS"" group and 585 in the ""other insurance plans"" group. We applied chi-square, log-rank and Cox (stepwise) to the different statistical analyses. The long term multivariate model with mortality as a dependent variable included 18 independent variables. Results: In-hospital mortality rates in the ""other insurance plans"" and ""SUS"" groups were 11.4% and 10.3%, respectively (p = 0.5); in the long term, survival chances in the groups were respectively, 70.4% ± 2.9 and 56.4% ± 4.0 (p = 0.001, hazard-ratio = 1.43, or a 43% higher chance of death in the ""SUS"" group). In the adjusted model, the ""SUS"" group had a significantly higher chance of death (a 36% higher chance, p = 0.005). Surgical revascularization and angioplasty improved the prognosis of these patients, whereas age and previous history of infarction, diabetes or heart failure worsened the prognosis. Conclusions: Relative to patients with other insurance plans, SUS users present similar mortality rates during hospital stay, but their prognosis is worse in the long term, thus reinforcing the need for additional efforts to improve the care provided to these patients after hospital discharge.",Follow-up studies; Health plans; Myocardial infarction,"acute heart infarction; adult; angioplasty; article; exercise; female; health insurance; hospital charge; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; mortality; patient assessment; survival time; Brazil; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Insurance, Health; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; National Health Programs; Patient Discharge; Prognosis; Treatment Outcome"

Technetium-99m pyrophosphate myocardial scintigraphy (MS) is used in the diagnosis of POMI; however it shows a limited sensitivity for subendocardial lesions. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), in turn, has a high accuracy in the detection of myocardial necrosis. Objective: To compare CMRI and MS for the detection of POMI after CABG. Methods: A total of 24 patients with chronic coronary artery disease were studied using the delayed contrast enhanced CMRI and MS before and after CABG by analyzing the development of areas of perioperative myocardial necrosis (POMI). Biochemical markers of myocardial injury (CKMB and troponin I) were also determined before and after surgery. Results: Nineteen patients completed the study. Of these, 6 (32%) presented POMI on CMRI and 4 (21%) on MS (p = NS). Of the 323 left ventricular segments assessed, 17 (5.3%) showed perioperative necrosis on CMRI and 7 (2.2%) on MS (p = 0.013). Moderate agreement was observed between the methods (kappa = 0.46). There was disagreement regarding the diagnosis of POMI in 4 (21%) cases, most of them with small areas of perioperative necrosis on CMRI which were not visualized on MS. In all cases with POMI on CMRI, significant CKMB and troponin I elevations were observed. Conclusion: Moderate diagnostic agreement was observed between the methods for the detection of POMI, but CMRI enabled visualization of small areas of perioperative myocardial necrosis which were not identified on MS and were associated with elevation of biochemical markers of myocardial injury.",Comparative studies; Magnetic resonance imaging; Myocardial infarction/surgery; Myocardial revascularization; Myocardial/radionuclide imaging; Technetium Tc99m pyrophosphate,"biochemical marker; troponin I; biological marker; creatine kinase MB; diagnostic agent; pyrophosphate technetium tc 99m; radiopharmaceutical agent; troponin I; adult; aged; artery disease; article; chronic disease; clinical article; controlled study; coronary artery bypass graft; female; heart infarction; heart muscle necrosis; heart scintiscanning; human; intermethod comparison; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; blood; chronic disease; comparative study; coronary artery disease; heart infarction; heart muscle revascularization; middle aged; necrosis; pathology; peroperative complication; scintiscanning; sensitivity and specificity; Biological Markers; Chronic Disease; Coronary Disease; Creatine Kinase, MB Form; Female; Humans; Intraoperative Complications; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Revascularization; Necrosis; Radiopharmaceuticals; Sensitivity and Specificity; Technetium Tc 99m Pyrophosphate; Troponin I"

BACKGROUND: Myocardial fibrosis secondary to ischemic disease can be imaged using MDE. Advanced CHD is characterized by progressive MF. METHODS: Fifty-one patients with CHD were enrolled: 15 seropositive asymptomatic participants in the indeterminate phase (IND); 26 patients with known clinical CHD; and 10 patients with known CHD and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Using a 1.5-T MRI system, we acquired left ventricular (LV) short-axis slices using cine-MRI (LV function) and inversion-recovery gradient-echo (MDE). RESULTS: Myocardial fibrosis by MRI was present in 68.6% of all patients, in 20% of IND, 84.6% of CHD, and 100% of VT (p < 0.001). Quantified MF increased progressively across disease severity subgroups (0.9 ± 2.3% in IND; 16.0 ± 12.3% in CHD; and 25.4 ± 9.8% in VT, p < 0.001) and New York Heart Association functional classes (I: 7.5 ± 9.5%; II: 21.9 ± 13.8%; and III: 25.3 ± 9.9% of LV mass, p < 0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction and MF had significant negative correlation (r = -0.78, p < 0.001), similar to the segmental MF and function: 4.9 ± 15.1% of MF in normal function, 32.5 ± 32.5% in mildly hypokinetic, 57.8 ± 31.4% in severely hypokinetic, and 72.3 ± 36.2% in akinetic and dyskinetic segments, respectively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In CHD, MDE by MRI quantifies MF that not only can be detected in the early asymptomatic stages but parallels well-established prognostic factors and provides unique information for clinical disease staging. © 2005 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.",,adult; akinesia; angiocardiography; article; Chagas disease; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease course; disease severity; dyskinesia; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle mass; heart muscle fibrosis; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; hyperkinesia; hypokinesia; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; prognosis; reproducibility; Chagas Cardiomyopathy; Female; Fibrosis; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Myocardium; Severity of Illness Index

Methods and results: Thirty-six patients with occluded infarct-related artery between 12 h and 14 days post-anterior MI were randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI group) or conservative therapy (no-PCI group). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at enrolment and after 6 months. The left ventricle was divided into infarct, adjacent, and remote segments. There was no difference in relation to LV volume between groups at the 6 month follow-up. Change in LV ejection fraction was favourable to the PCI group: 5.00% vs. -0.76%, P = 0.012. Change in circumferential shortening (Ecc) of the remote segments in the PCI group was significantly better than in the no-PCI group: -1.67 ± 6.30% vs. 0.29 ± 6.02%, P < 0.001. Infarct size and LV mass were similar between groups. Conclusions: Late recanalization improved LV ejection fraction and myocardial contractility in late follow-up, but did not change the ventricular volumes.

We sought to investigate whether alterations in cardiac high energy phosphates occur in postischemic 'stunned' human myocardium. Background. Transient postischemic myocardial dysfunction is a common phenomenon that occurs in a variety of clinical settings in the absence of necrosis, and its pathogenesis is still unclear. Cardiac high energy phosphates are reduced during ischemia, and persistently altered myocardial high energy phosphate metabolism has been suggested as a mechanism contributing to stunning. Methods. We studied 29 patients with a first anterior myocardial infarction (MI) who underwent successful reperfusion within 6 h of the onset of chest pain. These patients underwent 31p magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) a mean of 4 days after MI for measurement of left ventricular contractility and relative high energy phosphate metabolites. Twenty-one patients underwent a second 31P MRS study a mean of 39 days after MI. Eight volunteers served as control subjects. Results. Global and infarct area wall motion scores improved significantly between the early and late studies. No difference was found between early cardiac phosphocreatine (PCr)/beta-adenosine triphosphate (beta-ATP) ratios in patients and control subjects ([mean ± SD] 1.51 ± 0.17 vs. 1.61 ± 0.18, respectively, p = 0.17) or between early and late study results in patients (1.51 ± 0.17 vs. 1.53 ± 0.17, respectively, p = 0.6). For alpha of 0.05, the study bad a 90% power to detect a 9% difference. Conclusions. The results of this study demonstrate normal myocardial PCr/ATP ratios in patients with myocardial stunning after reperfusion and suggest that relative cardiac high energy phosphates are not depleted in stunned human myocardium.",,"adenosine triphosphate; creatine phosphate; fibrinolytic agent; adult; aged; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; heart catheterization; heart infarction; heart left ventricle contractility; heart muscle reperfusion; high energy phosphate; human; male; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; stunned heart muscle; thorax pain; transluminal coronary angioplasty; Adenosine Triphosphate; Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Stunning; Myocardium; Phosphocreatine; Ventricular Function, Left"

We evaluated 221 consecutive patients who were admitted with their first AMI and underwent thrombolysis. Patients were followed for an average of 31 months and were classified into 3 groups: group 1 included 51 patients with persistent ST-segment depression, group 2 had 97 patients with transient ST-segment depression, and group 3 consisted of 73 patients without ST- segment depression (absent). Group 1 had significantly worse long-term survival during follow up by Kaplan-Meier analysis (55%) versus group 2 (81%) and group 3 (94%) (p = 0.0004) and higher event rates. This prognostic significance seemed to be maintained in both the anterior and inferior wall AMI groups. Multivariate analysis, using the Cox model, showed that Killip class, in-hospital left ventricular ejection fraction, and the persistence of ST-segment depression on the predischarge electrocardiogram (group 1) were independent predictors of survival. ST-segment depression in non-infarct- related leads on the predischarge electrocardiogram is an independent risk factor for worse long-term survival after anterior as wall as inferior AMI treated with thrombolytic therapy.",,alteplase; acute heart infarction; adult; aged; article; diagnostic value; electrocardiogram; female; fibrinolytic therapy; human; human cell; human tissue; long term care; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prognosis; risk factor; st segment depression; survival time; Disease-Free Survival; Electrocardiography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Statistics; Thrombolytic Therapy

However, no information is available about long-term morphological changes in the wrapped latissimus dorsi (LD) muscle in humans. METHODS--The latissimus dorsi muscle flap was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 5 patients submitted to DC for treatment of severe dilated cardiomyopathy. All patients were studied from 24 to 52 months after the surgical procedure at the time of the cardiomyostimulator replacement. In the interim, LD was stimulated with burst of 6 pulses (burst duration 185 msec, burst freq 30Hz) synchronized to every cardiac contraction with a maximum of 100 LD contractions/min. Images were acquired on a GE Sigma 1.5 T system (TE = 25ms, TR = R- Rx2, slice thickness 8mm). RESULTS--The thickness of was 7.6 +/- 0.8mm. In addition, the signal intensity of the LD was compared with that of thoracic skeletal muscle and was found to be increased (2.19 +/- 0.42). The signal intensity was similar to that of subcutaneous fat in those images. CONCLUSION--Morphologic changes in the wrapped LD muscle consistent with fatty degeneration occur after DC and can be detected by MRI.

Eight patients were studied 15 days after the surgery (group 1) and 5 patients were studied from 24 to 52 months after the surgical procedure at the time of the cardiomyostimulator replacement (group 2). In the interim, LD was stimulated with burst of 6 pulses (duration, 185 milliseconds; burst frequency, 30 Hz) synchronized to every cardiac contraction, with a maximum of 100 LD contractions per minute. Images were acquired on a GE Sigma 1.5-T system (echo time, 25 milliseconds; repetition time, R-Rx2; slice thickness, 8 mm). The thickness of the LD decreased from 19.6±7.3 mm for group 1 to 7.6±0.8 mm for group 2 (P<.01). In addition, the signal intensity of the LD was compared with that of thoracic skeletal muscle and was found to be significantly increased in group 2 (2.19±0.42) compared with group 1 (1.04±0.07, P<.001). The signal intensity for group 2 on the T1-weighted images was similar to that of subcutaneous fat in those images. Conclusions: Morphological changes in the wrapped LD muscle consistent with fatty degeneration occur after DC and can be detected by MRI. Further studies will be necessary to demonstrate the clinical significance of such LD muscle flap changes.",cardiomyopathy; cardiomyoplasty; magnetic resonance imaging,"adult; cardiomyoplasty; clinical article; conference paper; congestive cardiomyopathy; controlled study; female; human; human tissue; latissimus dorsi flap; male; muscle atrophy; muscle excitation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; skeletal muscle; thorax wall; Adipose Tissue; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated; Cardiomyoplasty; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gated Blood-Pool Imaging; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Time Factors; Ventricular Function, Left"
Roberto Kalil Filho,Long-term function in the remote region after myocardial infarction: Importance of significant coronary stenoses in the non-infarct-related artery,1994,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028328294&partnerID=40&md5=d260d2e218d0aefdd69d8cbcb5f02ac4,Universidade de Sâo Paulo - Faculdade de Medicina,"Background - Left ventricular (LV) function is the most important determinant of outcome after a myocardial infarction. Global LV function after a myocardial infarction is affected not only by wall motion in the infarct zone but also by regional function in the contralateral territory. It was hypothesised that the presence of significant stenoses in coronary arteries supplying the contralateral territory might influence the ability of this region to compensate for damaged myocardium after a myocardial infarction. Methods and results - 79 patients treated with thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction had coronary and ventricular angiograms within 24 h and at a mean follow up of 12 months after myocardial infarction. Wall motion in the contralateral territory was analysed and scored by the centre line method and the change over time was correlated with the presence or absence of significant (>70%) diameter stenoses in the non-infarct-related artery. Mean (SD) contralateral territory motion worsened, from 0.74 (1.78) to 1.55 (2.06) SD chord (p < 0.001) in 40 patients with stenoses, whereas contralateral territory motion improved from -0.02 (2.4) to 0.63 (2.21) SD chord (p < 0.05) in the 39 patients without coronary stenoses. The same pattern was present whether or not the infarct artery was patent. The global left ventricular ejection fraction at 12 months was also related to contralateral territory motion (r = 0.71, p < 0.001) and to the presence of coronary stenoses (54 (15)% in those with coronary stenoses and 62 (16)% in those without, p < 0.05). Conclusion - The results demonstrate that significant stenoses in arteries supplying the non-infarct territory adversely affect global and regional left ventricular function after a transmural infarction. Non-infarct artery anatomy should be considered in intervention strategies to improve left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction.",,"beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium antagonist; fibrinolytic agent; nitrate; acute heart infarction; adult; article; blood clot lysis; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; coronary artery obstruction; female; heart ventricle wall motion; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Disease; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Thrombolytic Therapy; Ventricular Function, Left"

METHODS--We studied regional wall motion analyzed by the center-line method in two groups of patients with significant stenoses (> or = 70%) in the NRA after successful coronary reperfusion (chemical or mechanical thrombolysis). Group I (GI) consisted of 21 patients that were submitted to early (mean 14 days) complete surgical revascularization of both NRA and infarct related artery (IRA); the 12 group II (GII) patients underwent successful revascularization of the IRA only, with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (mean 6 days). Paired ventriculograms were obtained within 48 hours of the infarction and a mean of 17 months later. RESULTS--NI area contractility in GI patients improved from -0.35 +/- 2.16 to +0.62 +/- 1.6sd/chord (p < 0.05), whereas in GII decreased from +0.54 +/- 1.78 to -0.66 +/- 1.72 sd/chord (p < 0.05), p < 0.05 between the groups at follow-up. Mean infarct area wall motion did not differ between the two groups: from -3.04 +/- 2.43 to 2.61 +/- 2.49 sd/chord in GI (p = NS), and from -2.68 +/- 2.54 to -2.93 +/- 2.35 sd/chord in GII (p = NS). Mean global left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction did not change in GII patients (0.72 +/- 0.09 and 0.67 +/- 0.12, p = NS), but significantly increased from 0.63 +/- 0.12 to 0.72 +/- 0.11 in GI patients (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION--These data suggest that early revascularization of NRA with significant stenoses can improve not only the NI area regional contractility, but also the global LV function in the long-term follow-up of post MI patients treated with thrombolytic therapy.",,"adult; article; female; fibrinolytic therapy; follow up; heart contraction; heart infarction; heart left ventricle function; heart muscle reperfusion; heart muscle revascularization; heart stroke volume; human; male; pathophysiology; physiology; retrospective study; English Abstract; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Human; Male; Middle Age; Myocardial Contraction; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Reperfusion; Myocardial Revascularization; Retrospective Studies; Stroke Volume; Thrombolytic Therapy; Ventricular Function, Left"

Myocardial [13C]glycogen was continuously monitored by 13C-NMR spectroscopy in beating rat hearts perfused with oxygenated solutions containing [1-13C]glucose (5 mm) and insulin, during normal flow at 15 ml/min (n = 5), and during reperfusion after 30 min of 1 ml/min (n = 5), or 0 ml/min (n = 4) ischemia. Mean myocardial [13C]glycogen fell during reperfusion from 1.1 ± 0.6 at the end of zero-flow ischemia to 0.4 ± 0.4 μmol of [13C]glucosyl units/g wet wt (P&lt;0.02) over the first 7 min of reperfusion; it also fell during reflow following 1 ml/min ischemia, from 2.3 ± 1.4 to 1.7 ± 1.0 μmol (P&lt;0.03) over the same interval. In parallel experiments, glycogen phosphorylase % a(GPA%) content was higher at the end of 30 min of 0 ml/min (37.3 ± 7.3%, P&lt;0.01), and trended higher after 1 ml/min flow (30.8 ± 12.1%, P=0.18) than under baseline conditions (20.1 ± 7.4%). However GPA% returned to baseline values within 1 min of reflow after both 0 and 1 ml/min ischemic periods (20.6 ± 3.0% and 19.0 ± 8.0%, respectively). Inorganic phosphate, as determined by simultaneous 31P-NMR, remained elevated during early reperfusion relative to baseline, and significantly correlated with the extent of decline in [13C]glycogen during reperfusion (r = 0.79, P&lt;0.01). Thus, glycogen breakdown continues to occur during early post-ischemic reperfusion, but the mechanism is not related to elevated GPA%, and may be due to persistently increased inorganic phosphate at that time. © 1991.",13C-NMR; Glycogen; Ischemia; Phosphorylase,"glycogen; glycogen phosphorylase; phosphate; animal tissue; article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; controlled study; glycogen metabolism; glycogenolysis; heart muscle ischemia; male; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; rat; reperfusion; tissue level; Adenosine Monophosphate; Animal; Coronary Disease; Glucose-6-Phosphate; Glucosephosphates; Glycogen; In Vitro; Kinetics; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Myocardial Contraction; Myocardial Reperfusion; Phosphates; Phosphorylases; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Animalia"
