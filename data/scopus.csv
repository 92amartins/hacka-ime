Sharks are generally considered to be more active during nocturnal periods than during the day; however, few studies have empirically evaluated diel variation in shark habitat use and how anthropogenic disturbances may influence these patterns. In the western central Atlantic Ocean, tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) are highly abundant in the shallow waters of the Little Bahama Bank, Bahamas. Within the northwest edge of the Bank, there is an area nicknamed “Tiger Beach,” where tiger sharks are provisioned year-round at spatially discrete ecotourism dive sites spanning ~ 1.5 km2. In this study, we used an array of acoustic receivers encircling an area of 102.4 km2 to evaluate for potential differences in diel spatial habitat use patterns for 42 tagged tiger sharks at Tiger Beach and the surrounding area. Using tracking data from 24 June 2014 to 13 May 2015, we evaluated spatial and diel patterns of shark activity space, centers of activity, residency and the daily proportion of sharks detected within the array. Sharks were detected during both day and night with no significant diel differences in habitat use metrics across the array, although spatial differences in residency existed. Four sharks accounted for 53.8% of residency data throughout the tracking period, with the majority of sharks primarily entering and exiting the array, except during summer months when the most of the tagged tiger sharks were absent from the array. We also found limited empirical support for hypothesized effects of provisioning tourism on tiger shark habitat use. However, additional research at finer, individual scales, may be needed to better resolve the potential influence of provisioning on tiger sharks at Tiger Beach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Diel; Habitat use; Movement; Nocturnal; Shark; Tourism","Animalia; Chondrichthyes; Galeocerdo; Galeocerdo cuvier"

A positive future for this epoch can be referred to as the “good Anthropocene” and would involve effective management strategies and changes in human behavior that promote the sustainability and restoration of ecosystems. Recreational fisheries hold significant social, cultural, and economic value and can generate many benefits when managed sustainably and thus be an integral part of a “good Anthropocene”. Here, we list ten commandments to facilitate persistence and long-term sustainability of recreational fisheries in the “good Anthropocene”. This list includes fostering aquatic stewardship, promoting education, using appropriate capture gear, adopting evidence-based management approaches, promoting the concept of resilience, obtaining and using effort data in management, embracing the ecosystem approach, engaging in multilevel collaboration, enhancing accessibility, and embracing optimism. When used singly, or simultaneously, these ten commandments will contribute to the harmonization of sustainable fish populations and angling practices, to create recreational fisheries’ “bright spots”. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Anthropocene; Commandments; Management; Recreational fishing; Sustainability","Aquatic ecosystems; Behavioral research; Ecology; Ecosystems; Geology; Management; Sustainable development; Anthropocene; Commandments; Ecosystem approach; Effective management; Evidence-based managements; Long-term sustainability; Recreational fisheries; Recreational fishings; Fisheries; angling; Anthropocene; ecosystem resilience; environmental restoration; fishery; fishery management; fishing; future prospect; management practice; recreational activity; sustainability; ecosystem; education; fishery; fishing; human; human experiment; optimism"

Different sexual selection regimes may occur among populations/subspecies within the same species. This is particularly the case when mate choice is based on multiple sexually selected traits. However, empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis at the among-populations level is scarce. We conducted a meta-analysis of the intensity of sexual selection on the largest database to date for a single species, the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), relying on quantitative estimates of sexual selection. The intensity of sexual selection was expressed as the strength (effect size) of the relationships between six plumage ornaments (tail length, tail asymmetry, size of white spots on tail, ventral plumage colour, throat plumage colour and throat patch size) and several fitness proxies related to reproduction, parental care, offspring quality, arrival date from spring migration, and survival. The data were gathered for four geographically separated subspecies (H. r. rustica, H. r. erythrogaster, H. r. gutturalis, H. r. transitiva). The overall mean effect size (Zr = 0.214; 95% confidence interval = 0.175–0.254; N = 329) was of intermediate magnitude, with intensity of sexual selection being stronger in males than in females. Effect sizes varied during the breeding cycle, being larger before egg deposition, when competition for access to mates reaches its maximum (i.e. in the promiscuous part of the breeding cycle), and decreasing thereafter. In addition, effect sizes from experiments were not significantly larger than those from correlative studies. Finally, sexual selection on different sexually dimorphic traits varied among subspecies. This last result suggests that morphological divergence among populations has partly arisen from divergent sexual selection, which may eventually lead to speciation. © 2016 Cambridge Philosophical Society","barn swallow; Hirundo rustica; mate choice; meta-analysis; multiple sexually selected traits; population divergence; secondary sexual traits; sexual selection; speciation; subspecies",

Common hosts could distinguish parasites as the result of coevolution, while rare hosts or non-hosts may mistake cuckoos for hawks because rare hosts or non-hosts behave similarly when faced with these two species. Birds usually produce alarm calls in addition to showing behavioral responses when in danger. However, previous studies of identification by rare hosts or non-hosts of sparrowhawks usually lacked experimental evidence of alarm calls. Great tits Parus major, a rare cuckoo host, perform similar behaviors and usually produce alarm calls in response to sparrowhawks and common cuckoos. Here, we tested whether great tits could distinguish common cuckoo from sparrowhawk based on analysis of their alarm calls and the effects of playback of alarm calls on conspecific behavior. Previous studies showed that great tits have a complex communication system that conveys information about predators, and they could perform different kinds of response behavior to different alarm calls. If great tits have not made the ability to distinguish between common cuckoo and sparrowhawk, then their acoustic responses to these two species and their response behaviors in playback experiments should be similar. Specimens of a common cuckoo (parasite), a sparrowhawk (predator) and an Oriental turtle dove Streptopelia orientalis (harmless control) were used to elicit and subsequently record the response behavior and alarm calls of great tits. There was no significant difference in behavioral response among great tits when exposed to the dummy of cuckoo, sparrowhawk and dove. In contrast, they differed significantly in alarm calls. Great tits produced more notes per call that contained increasing D-type and decreasing I-type notes when responding to sparrowhawk as compared to cuckoo or dove. In playback experiments, we found that great tits responded more strongly to great tit hawk than to great tit cuckoo or great tit dove alarm calls. Our study suggests that great tits are able to distinguish sparrowhawks from common cuckoos and convey relevant information in alarm calls by adjusting the number and combinations of notes of a single call type. © 2017 The Authors.

Walleye (Sander vitreus) are a valuable, highly exploited fishery resource in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Here, fishery capture of walleye with internal acoustic transmitters combined with a high reward program provided multiple opportunities to examine photographs and quantify the status of surgical incisions. Walleye (n = 926) from reef and river spawning populations in Lake Erie and Lake Huron were implanted with acoustic transmitters during spring spawning events from 2011 to 2016. Incisions were closed with polydioxanone monofilament using two to three interrupted sutures. Out of 276 recaptured fish, 60 incision sites were clearly visible in photographs, and these were scored by two independent readers for incision closure, inflammation, and the presence of sutures. Results: While incision sites were completely closed by 61 days post-release (95% CI 44-94), sutures remained for up to 866 days. Sutures were expelled serially during a protracted period, and the probability of observing at least one suture in a recaptured fish declined below 50% after 673 days (95% CI 442-1016). Inflammation at the incision increased during the first 71 days and then declined monotonically, remaining detectable at low levels. Conclusion: Our results emphasized that sutures remained in free-ranging fish past the time when they were beneficial for incision healing. Most dissolvable sutures have been designed for use in endotherms where the body temperature and internal milieu differ dramatically from the conditions experienced by fishes in temperate climates. Identification of new suture materials for fish that facilitate healing while absorbing or dissolving in a reasonable period (e.g., a few weeks to three months) in colder temperatures (e.g., <12 °C) would be beneficial to mitigate potential adverse impacts from inflammation at the incision. © 2017 The Author(s).","Acoustic telemetry; Tagging effects; Walleye",

Specifically, we provide an overview of the ways in which acoustic telemetry can be used to inform issues central to the ecology, conservation, and management of exploited and/or imperiled fish species. Despite great strides in this area in recent years, there are comparatively few examples where data have been applied directly to influence fisheries management and policy. We review the literature on this issue, identify the strengths and weaknesses of work done to date, and highlight knowledge gaps and difficulties in applying empirical fish telemetry studies to fisheries policy and practice. We then highlight the key areas of management and policy addressed, as well as the challenges that needed to be overcome to do this. We conclude with a set of recommendations about how researchers can, in consultation with stock assessment scientists and managers, formulate testable scientific questions to address and design future studies to generate data that can be used in a meaningful way by fisheries management and conservation practitioners.

The nuclear accident that occurred more than 30 years ago in Chernobyl resulted in significant changes in diversity and richness of microbial communities that could influence characteristics of animal-bacteria interactions, including host immune responses and competitive interference by bacteria. Given the high mortality rate of birds breeding in radioactively contaminated zones, those with stronger defences against infections should experience significant fitness advantages. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we characterized antimicrobial capacity of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from different Ukrainian populations (subject to a gradient of ionizing radiation) against 12 bacterial species. We also quantified constitutive innate immunity, which is the non-specific first barrier of protection of hosts against microbial parasites. We found a positive association between specific antimicrobial capacity of individual hosts and radiation levels in breeding habitats even after controlling for other confounding variables such as sex and age. However, no significant relationship was found between immunocompetence (non-specific response) and background radiation. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that radiation selects for broad antimicrobial spectra of barn swallows, although not for all bacterial strains.

Birds are known to show earlier timing of spring migration and reproduction in response to warmer springs. However, species show heterogeneous phenological responses to climate warming, with those that have not advanced or have delayed migration phenology experiencing population declines. Although some traits (such as migration distance) partly explain heterogeneity in phenological responses, the factors affecting interspecies differences in the responsiveness to climate warming have yet to be fully explored. In this comparative study, we investigate whether variation in wing aspect ratio (reflecting relative wing narrowness), an ecomorphological trait that is strongly associated with flight efficiency and migratory behaviour, affects the ability to advance timing of spring migration during 1960–2006 in a set of 80 European migratory bird species. Species with larger aspect ratio (longer and narrower wings) showed smaller advancement of timing of spring migration compared to species with smaller aspect ratio (shorter and wider wings) while controlling for phylogeny, migration distance and other life-history traits. In turn, migration distance positively predicted aspect ratio across species. Hence, species that are better adapted to migration appear to be more constrained in responding phenologically to rapid climate warming by advancing timing of spring migration. Our findings corroborate the idea that aspect ratio is a major evolutionary correlate of migration, and suggest that selection for energetically efficient flights, as reflected by high aspect ratio, may hinder phenotypically plastic/microevolutionary adjustments of migration phenology to ongoing climatic changes. © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

Although the underlying mechanisms of size reductions remain poorly understood, effects appear stronger at latitudinal extremes (poles and tropics) and in aquatic rather than terrestrial systems. To shed light on this phenomenon, we examined the size dependence of critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and aerobic metabolism in a commercially important tropical reef fish, the leopard coral grouper (Plectropomus leopardus) following acclimation to current-day (28.5 °C) vs. projected end-of-century (33 °C) summer temperatures for the northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). CTmax declined from 38.3 to 37.5 °C with increasing body mass in adult fish (0.45–2.82 kg), indicating that larger individuals are more thermally sensitive than smaller conspecifics. This may be explained by a restricted capacity for large fish to increase mass-specific maximum metabolic rate (MMR) at 33 °C compared with 28.5 °C. Indeed, temperature influenced the relationship between metabolism and body mass (0.02–2.38 kg), whereby the scaling exponent for MMR increased from 0.74 ± 0.02 at 28.5 °C to 0.79 ± 0.01 at 33 °C, and the corresponding exponents for standard metabolic rate (SMR) were 0.75 ± 0.04 and 0.80 ± 0.03. The increase in metabolic scaling exponents at higher temperatures suggests that energy budgets may be disproportionately impacted in larger fish and contribute to reduced maximum adult size. Such climate-induced reductions in body size would have important ramifications for fisheries productivity, but are also likely to have knock-on effects for trophodynamics and functioning of ecosystems. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","body size; climate change; critical thermal maximum; Great Barrier Reef; metabolic rate; Plectropomus leopardus; thermal tolerance","Animalia; Anthozoa; Epinephelinae; Panthera pardus; Plectropomus leopardus"

We examined factors that potentially influence timing of migration and migratory propensity in a wild population of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) by combining experimental manipulations with passive integrated transponder telemetry. Individuals were subjected to one of six manipulations: three designed to mimic natural stressors (temperature increase, food deprivation, and chase by a simulated predator), an injection of exogenous cortisol designed to mimic an extreme physiological challenge, a sham injection, and a control group. By measuring length and mass of 923 individuals prior to manipulation and by monitoring tagged individuals as they left the stream months later, we assessed whether pre-existing differences influenced migratory tendency and timing of migration, and whether our manipulations affected growth, condition, and timing of migration. We found that pre-existing differences predicted migration, with smaller individuals and individuals in poor condition having a higher propensity to migrate. Exogenous cortisol manipulation had the largest negative effect on growth and condition, and resulted in an earlier migration date. Additionally, low-growth individuals within the temperature and food deprivation treatments migrated earlier. By demonstrating that both pre-existing differences in organism state and additional stressors can affect whether and when individuals migrate, we highlight the importance of understanding individual differences in partial migration. These effects may carry over to influence migration success and affect the evolutionary dynamics of sub-populations experiencing different levels of stress, which is particularly relevant in a changing world. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Brown trout; Cortisol; Life-history strategy; Partial migration; Passive integrated transponder","Salmo trutta"

Broadly, the consequences of climate change on inland fishes will impact global food security, the livelihoods of people who depend on inland capture and recreational fisheries. However, understanding how climate change will affect inland fishes and fisheries has lagged behind marine assessments. Building from a North American inland fisheries assessment, we convened an expert panel from seven countries to provide a first-step to a framework for determining how to approach an assessment of how climate change may affect inland fishes, capture fisheries, and aquaculture globally. Starting with the small group helped frame the key questions (e.g., who is the audience? What is the best approach and spatial scale?). Data gaps identified by the group include: the tolerances of inland fisheries to changes in temperature, stream flows, salinity, and other environmental factors linked to climate change, and the adaptive capacity of fishes and fisheries to adjust to these changes. These questions are difficult to address, but long-term and large-scale datasets are becoming more readily available as a means to test hypotheses related to climate change.

We have identified nine co-localized CYP2 genes (∼55 kb) in a new cluster in the genome of the highly resilient ecotoxicological fish model Kryptolebias marmoratus. Molecular characterization, temporal and tissue-specific expression pattern, and response to xenobiotics of these genes were examined. The CYP2 gene clusters were characterized and designated CYP2N22-23, CYP2AD12, and CYP2P16-20. Gene synteny analysis confirmed that the cluster in K. marmoratus is similar to that found in other teleost fishes, including zebrafish. A gene duplication event with diverged catalytic function was observed in CYP2AD12. Moreover, a high level of divergence in expression was observed among the co-localized genes. Phylogeny of the cluster suggested an orthologous relationship with similar genes in zebrafish and Japanese medaka. Gene expression analysis showed that CYP2P19 and CYP2N20 were consecutively expressed throughout embryonic development, whereas CYP2P18 was expressed in all adult tissues, suggesting that members of each CYP2 gene family have different physiological roles even though they are located in the same cluster. Among endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), benzo[α]pyrene (B[α]P) induced expression of CYP2N23, bisphenol A (BPA) induced CYP2P18 and CYP2P19, and 4-octylphenol (OP) induced CYP2AD12, but there was no significant response to 4-nonylphenol (NP), implying differential catalytic roles of the enzyme. In this paper, we identify and characterize a CYP2 gene cluster in the mangrove killifish K. marmoratus with differing catalytic roles toward EDCs.

A combination of their slow-growing nature and high use-values have resulted in population declines for many species around the world, and to date the vast majority of fisheries-related work on sharks has focused on the commercial sector. Shark recreational fishing remains an overlooked area of research despite the fact that these practices are popular globally and could present challenges to their populations. Here we provide a topical overview of shark recreational fisheries, highlighting their history and current status. While recreational fishing can provide conservation benefits under certain circumstances, we focus our discourse on the relatively understudied, potentially detrimental impacts these activities may have on shark physiology, behavior, and fitness. We took this angle given the realized but potentially underestimated significance of recreational fishing for shark conservation management plans and stock assessments, in hopes of creating a dialogue around sustainability. We also present a series of broad and focused research questions and underpin areas of future research need to assist with the development of this emergent area of research. © 2016, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Fishing; Marine; Recreational; Resource; Sharks","Chondrichthyes; animal; environmental protection; fishery; recreation; shark; trends; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fisheries; Recreation; Sharks"

Here, we partition the variance in an anti-predator behaviour, flight initiation distance (FID), and assess how its within- and between-population variance are related to life history, distribution, dispersal and habitat ecology. Although the composition of within-species variance in FID depended on the phylogeny, most variance occurred within populations. When accounting for allometry, density-dependence, uncertainty in the phylogenetic hypothesis and heterogeneity in data quality, within-population variance was significantly associated with habitat diversity and population size. Between-population variance was a significant predictor of natal dispersal, senescence and habitat diversity. Accordingly, not only species-specific mean values of a behavioural trait, but also its variance within and among populations can shape the evolutionary ecology of species. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","ecological plasticity; life history; mixed-models; pace of life syndromes; personality; repeatability; variation in behaviour","animal; bird; ecosystem; Europe; evolution; flying; genetics; phenotype; phylogeny; physiology; Animals; Biological Evolution; Birds; Ecosystem; Europe; Flight, Animal; Phenotype; Phylogeny"

To fully understand how wild organisms are affected by stressors, it is crucial to understand the physiology that underlies an organism's response to a stressor. Prolonged levels of elevated glucocorticoids are associated with a state of chronic stress and decreased fitness. Exogenous glucocorticoid manipulation reduces an individual's ability to forage, avoid predators and grow, thereby limiting the resources available for physiological functions like defence against oxidative stress. Using brown trout (Salmo trutta), we evaluated the short-term (2 weeks) and long-term (4 months over winter) effects of exogenous cortisol manipulations (versus relevant shams and controls) on the oxidative status of wild juveniles. Cortisol caused an increase in glutathione over a 2 week period and appeared to reduce glutathione over winter. Cortisol treatment did not affect oxidative stress levels or low molecular weight antioxidants. Cortisol caused a significant decrease in growth rates but did not affect predation risk. Over-winter survival in the stream was associated with low levels of oxidative stress and glutathione. Thus, oxidative stress may be a mechanism by which elevated cortisol causes negative physiological effects. © 2017.

Using previously described, multi-isotope (δ13C, δ15N, δ2H) feather isoscapes for Africa, we identified the most probable wintering areas for house martins Delichon urbica breeding at Badajoz in southwestern Spain. We identified two most-probable wintering areas differing in isotopic signature in west Africa. We found that the probability to winter in the isotopic cluster two was related to age and sex of individuals. Specifically, experienced males (i.e. two years or older) winter in the isotopic cluster two with a greater probability than experienced females, whereas first-year females winter in the isotopic cluster two with a greater probability than first-year males. In addition, wintering area was correlated with breeding phenology, with individuals wintering in the isotopic cluster two initiating their clutches earlier than those wintering in the isotopic cluster one. For birds wintering in the isotopic cluster two, there was no relationship between age and clutch initiation date. In contrast, young birds wintering in the isotopic cluster one initiated their clutches earlier than experienced birds wintering in this area. There was no significant correlation between wintering area and clutch size or the number of fledglings produced.

As a consequence, fshers have adopted unique strategies for exploiting fsh at night or in dark systems. We propose that neglecting the night has led to an incomplete understanding of aquatic organismal ecology, population/community dynamics, and ecosystem function with consequences for fsheries conservation management.

An often-untested assumption of electronic tagging studies is that tagged fish are representative of untagged conspecifics and thus show ‘normal’ behaviour (e.g. movement rates, swimming activity, feeding). Here, we use a unique data set for potamadromous walleye (Sander vitreus) in Lake Huron and Lake Erie tributaries to assess whether the lack of appropriate controls in electronic tagging could seriously affect behavioural data. We used fish tagged in previous years and compared their migratory behaviour during the spawning season to fish tagged in a current year at the same location. The objective of the study was to determine whether intracoelomic acoustic tag implantation altered downstream movement of walleye after spawning. Fish tagged in a given season travelled slower downstream from two river spawning sites than fish tagged in previous years. Fish tagged one or two years earlier showed no differences between each other in downstream travel time, in contrast to fish tagged in a given year. Our results support notions that standard collection and intracoelomic tagging procedures can alter short-term behaviour (i.e. days, weeks, months), and as such, researchers should use caution when interpreting data collected over such time periods.

TIGIT and CD96 together with the co-stimulatory receptor CD226 form a pathway that is analogous to the CD28/CTLA-4 pathway, in which shared ligands and differential receptor:ligand affinities fine-tune the immune response. Although the roles of TIGIT and CD96 as immune checkpoint receptors in T cell and natural killer cell biology are just beginning to be uncovered, accumulating data support the targeting of these receptors for improving anti-tumor immune responses.

First, evidences suggest that neoplastic cells, as any living entities subject to natural selection, are governed by trade-offs such as between survival and proliferation. Second, selection might also have shaped trade-offs at the organismal level, especially regarding protective mechanisms against cancer. Cancer can also emerge as a consequence of additional trade-offs in organisms (e.g., eco-immunological trade-offs).

Yet, spatiotemporal variability in energy expenditure has rarely been explored in fully aquatic species such as fish. Our objective was to quantify spatially explicit energy expenditure for a tropical marine teleost fish, bonefish (Albula vulpes), to examine how bonefish energetics vary across landscape features and temporal factors. Using a swim tunnel respirometer, we calibrated acoustic accelerometer transmitters implanted in bonefish to estimate their metabolic rates and energy expenditure, and applied this technology in situ using a fine-scale telemetry system on a heterogeneous reef flat in Puerto Rico. Bonefish energy expenditure varied most among habitats, with significant interactions between habitat and temporal factors (i.e., diel period, tide state, season). The energy expenditure was generally highest in shallow water habitats (i.e., seagrass and reef crest). Variation in activity levels was the main driver of these differences in energy expenditure, which in shallow, nearshore habitats is likely related to foraging. Bonefish moderate energy expenditure across seasonal fluctuations in temperature, by selectively using shallow nearshore habitats at moderate water temperatures that correspond with their scope for activity. Quantifying how animals expend energy in association with environmental and ecological factors can provide important insight into behavioral ecology, with implications for bioenergetics models. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Acceleration transmitter; Acoustic telemetry; Animal behavior; Bioenergetics; Landscape ecology","Albula vulpes; Albulidae; Animalia; Teleostei; animal; animal behavior; ecosystem; energy metabolism; fish; swimming; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Ecosystem; Energy Metabolism; Fishes; Swimming"

As charismatic megafauna, nesting and foraging sea turtles are increasingly the focus of ecotourism activities. The purpose of our study was to quantify the behavioral responses of immature green turtles (Chelonia mydas) to disturbance by snorkelers, and to investigate whether turtles have individual-level responses to snorkeler disturbance. Using a standardized disturbance stimulus in the field, we recorded turtle behaviors pre- and post-disturbance by snorkelers. Ninety percent of turtles disturbed by snorkeler (n = 192) initiated their flights at distances of ≤3 m. Using principal component analysis, we identified two distinct turtle personality types, ‘bold’ and ‘timid’, based upon 145 encounters of 19 individually identified turtles and five disturbance response variables. There was significant intra-individual repeatability in behavioral responses to disturbance, but bolder turtles had more behavioral plasticity and less consistent responses than more timid individuals. Bolder individuals with reduced evasion responses might be at a higher risk of shark predation, while more timid turtles might have greater energetic consequences due to non-lethal predator effects and repeated snorkeler disturbance. Over the longer term, a turtle population with a mix of bold and timid individuals may promote more resilient populations. We recommend that snorkelers maintain >3 m distance from immature green turtles when snorkeling, and that ecotourism activities be temporally and spatially stratified. Further, turtle watching guidelines need to be communicated to both tour operators and independent snorkelers to reduce the disturbance of turtles. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Ecotourism; Flight initiation distance; Personality; Principal component analysis; Repeatability","Animalia; Chelonia mydas; Cheloniidae; Chondrichthyes; Testudines; animal; diving; human; predation; shark; turtle; Animals; Diving; Humans; Predatory Behavior; Sharks; Turtles"

Previous studies suggested that certain ecological, demographic, life-history and genetic characteristics of species might be related to the degree of their population fluctuations. We checked whether that was the case in a large sample of 231 European breeding bird species while taking a number of potentially confounding factors such as population trends or similarities among species due to common descent into account. When species-specific characteristics were analysed one by one, the magnitude of population fluctuations was positively related to coloniality, habitat, total breeding range, heterogeneity of breeding distribution and natal dispersal, and negatively related to urbanisation, abundance, relative number of subspecies, parasitism and proportion of polymorphic loci. However, when abundance (population size) was included in the analyses of the other parameters, only coloniality, habitat, total breeding range and abundance remained significantly related to population fluctuations. The analysis including all these predictors simultaneously showed that population size fluctuated more in colonial, less abundant species with larger breeding ranges. Other parameters seemed to be related to population fluctuations only because of their association with abundance or coloniality. The unexpected positive relationship between population fluctuations and total breeding range did not seem to be mediated by abundance. The link between population fluctuations and coloniality suggests a previously unrecognized cost of coloniality. The negative relationship between population size and population fluctuations might be explained by at least three types of non-mutually exclusive stochastic processes: demographic, environmental and genetic stochasticity. Measurement error in population indices, which was unknown, may have contributed to the negative relationship between population size and fluctuations, but apparently only to a minor extent. The association between population size and fluctuations suggests that populations might be stabilized by increasing population size. © 2017 Cuervo,Møller et al.

The extent to which these encounters reduce fish survival through injury and physiological impairment depends on multiple factors including capture severity, river temperature and infectious agents. In an effort to characterize the mechanisms of post-release mortality and address fishery and managerial concerns regarding specific regulations, wild-caught Early Stuart sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were exposed to either mild (20 s) or severe (20 min) gillnet entanglement and then held at ecologically relevant temperatures throughout their period of river migration (mid-late July) and spawning (early August). Individuals were biopsy sampled immediately after entanglement and at death to measure indicators of stress and immunity, and the infection intensity of 44 potential pathogens. Biopsy alone increased mortality (males: 33%, females: 60%) when compared with nonbiopsied controls (males: 7%, females: 15%), indicating high sensitivity to any handling during river migration, especially among females. Mortality did not occur until 5-10 days after entanglement, with severe entanglement resulting in the greatest mortality (males: 62%, females: 90%), followed by mild entanglement (males: 44%, females: 70%). Infection intensities of Flavobacterium psychrophilum and Ceratonova shasta measured at death were greater in fish that died sooner. Physiological indicators of host stress and immunity also differed depending on longevity, and indicated anaerobic metabolism, osmoregulatory failure and altered immune gene regulation in premature mortalities. Together, these results implicate latent effects of entanglement, especially among females, resulting in mortality days or weeks after release. Although any entanglement is potentially detrimental, reducing entanglement durations can improve post-release survival. © The Author 2017.

We also measured routine metabolic rate and oxygen consumption in response to a food stimulus in B. giganteus to assess whether these variables are related to individual differences in personality. We found that both species show an activity syndrome across environmental contexts, but the underlying mechanistic basis of this syndrome, particularly in B. giganteus, is unclear. Contrary to our initial predictions, neither B. giganteus nor B. tricarinata showed any differences between mean expression of behavioural traits between sexes. Both sexes of B. tricarinata showed strong evidence of an activity syndrome underlying movement and foraging ecology, whereas only male B. giganteus showed evidence of an activity syndrome. Generally, individuals that were more active and bolder, in a standard open arena test were also more active when a food stimulus was present. Interestingly, individual differences in metabolism were not related to individual differences in behaviour based on present data.

While basic tenants of best practices are well established, anglers employ a diversity of tactics for a range of fish species, thus it is important to balance science-based best practices with the realities of dynamic angler behaviour. Here we describe how certain tools and tactics can be integrated into recreational fishing practices to marry best angling practices with the realities of angling. While the effects of angling practices vary considerably across contexts and conditions, we also outline available methods for assessing fish condition by examining physical injuries and reflexes, which enable recreational anglers to make educated real-time decisions related to angling practices, as well as when, where, and whether to release captured fish based on their probability of survival. In cases where fish are in poor condition, there are recovery tactics available that can improve survival, although this is among the most understudied aspects of angling practices. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Angling; Conservation; Fishing; Management",

We find that K. marmoratus genome maintains number and composition of TEs. This can be an important genomic attribute promoting genome recombination in this selfing fish, while, in addition to a mixed mating strategy, it may also represent a mechanism contributing to the evolutionary adaptation to ecological pressure of the species. Future work should help clarify this point further once genomic information is gathered for other taxa of the family Rivulidae that do not self-fertilize.

Here, the toxicity of MeHg in the benthic copepod Tigriopus japonicus was assessed, and its adverse effects on growth rate and reproduction were demonstrated. Antioxidant enzymatic activities were increased in the presence of MeHg, indicating that these enzymes play an important role in the defense response to MeHg, which is regulated by a complex mechanism. Subsequent activation of different patterns of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways was demonstrated, providing a mechanistic approach to understand the signaling pathways involved in the effects of MeHg.

The ABC proteins function as active transporters for multiple substrates across the cellular membrane by ATP hydrolysis. As this superfamily is derived from a common ancestor, ABC genes have evolved via lineage-specific duplications through the process of adaptation. In this review, we summarized information about the ABC gene families in aquatic invertebrates, considering their evolution and putative functions in defense mechanisms. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to examine the evolutionary significance of ABC gene families in aquatic invertebrates. Particularly, a massive expansion of multixenobiotic resistance (MXR)-mediated efflux transporters was identified in the absence of the ABCG2 (BCRP) gene in Ecdysozoa and Platyzoa, suggesting that a loss of Abcg2 gene occurred sporadically in these species during divergence of Protostome to Lophotrochozoa.

Aquatic protected areas (APAs) have been designated in some habitats in efforts to prohibit harvesting and maintain natural ranges of phenotypic variation for impacted species. Here, we attempted to test whether APAs that prohibit all forms of fishing have an evolutionary influence on adult largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) behaviour by investigating the relationship between capture method and behavioural type. Fish, caught via active (angling) and passive (hoop net) capture techniques in both protected (70+ year old APAs in eastern Ontario) and adjacent nonprotected areas, were subjected to standard tests of boldness (refuge emergence, general activity, and flight-initiationdistance). A behavioural syndrome characterized by consistent within-individual variation and correlation of boldness behaviours (activity and refuge emergence) was present.

This study sought to calibrate tri-axial acceleration biologgers (accelerometers) such that it would be possible to estimate swimming speeds and metabolic rates of semi-captive sharks in an enclosed natural mesocosm. Juvenile lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris, Poey; 60–75 cm total length, 1–2 kg) were equipped with accelerometers and swum at stepwise velocity increments in a Blazka-style swim tunnel respirometer using a critical swimming speed protocol. Metabolic rates and acceleration-derived metrics (overall dynamic body acceleration and tailbeat frequency) were measured concurrently during forced swimming, and accelerometer-equipped sharks were released to an enclosed mesocosm habitat to estimate average daily metabolic rate (ADMR) and swimming velocities across diel and tidal cycles. Acceleration-derived tailbeat frequency was a stronger predictor of metabolic rate than overall dynamic body action, and predicted an active metabolic rate of 249.7 ± 1.9 mg O2 kg− 1 h− 1 and an ADMR of 88.7 ± 0.7 kJ kg− 1 d− 1 at 30 °C. Following exhaustive exercise a maximum metabolic rate of 398.0 ± 19.6 mg O2 kg− 1 h− 1 was achieved and over the subsequent 55-minute recovery period excess post-exercise oxygen consumption was 31.2 mg O2 kg− 1. The critical swimming speed of the sharks was 0.71 ± 0.03 body lengths per second (BL s− 1), and swimming speed in the mesocosm was 0.19 ± 0.01 BL s− 1. Locomotor activity levels of semi-captive sharks in the mesocosm were influenced by tide state and diel period, with sharks having highest swimming velocities during diurnal periods and flooding tides. Overall, accelerometry is a suitable means for estimating swimming speed and metabolic rate in this species, and additional research to address anaerobic energy expenditure of wild sharks is warranted. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Behavior; Biotelemetry; Dynamic body acceleration; Elasmobranch; Energetics; Tailbeat frequency","Animalia; Chondrichthyes; Negaprion; Negaprion brevirostris"

Traversing high flows downstream of dams is an energetically challenging activity that could influence survival and spawning success following passage. Carryover effects, however, are an underappreciated consequence of dam passage that have been overlooked by researchers and natural resource managers. We conducted a large-scale management experiment to determine if the operation of dam attraction flows could be changed to reduce high sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka mortality following passage and increase spawning success. We tested two flow conditions: (i) a baseline condition—currently used by managers—that released high attraction flows directly adjacent to the entrance to a vertical-slot fishway and (ii) an alternative condition that released attraction flows 10 m away from the fishway entrance to reduce the flows fish swim through while approaching the passage structure. We tagged 637 sockeye salmon with telemetry tags to monitor dam passage, post-passage survival to spawning grounds and spawning success under the two flow conditions. Validated fish counters at the exit of the fishway and on spawning grounds were used to generate population level estimates of survival to spawning grounds. Individuals exposed to baseline flow conditions spent two times longer recovering from dam passage and exhibited 10% higher mortality following passage than those exposed to alternative flows. Release of alternative flows for 10 days assisted approximately 550 fish (or 3% of total spawners) in reaching spawning grounds. Once on spawning grounds, female spawning success was strongly influenced by individual spawning characteristics (longevity and date of arrival on spawning grounds) and not dam flow condition. Our findings highlight a cost-effective solution that decreases mortality following passage simply by altering the location of dam flow releases and not reductions in discharge.

Such polymorphism has recently received increasing attention in parasitic cuckoo-host systems, in which egg polymorphism in hosts is regarded as a specific adaptation against cuckoo parasitism. Here, we provided a theoretical analysis to investigate the effect of host egg polymorphism on the rate of successful parasitism (SPR) by cuckoos to help better understand the role of egg polymorphism in cuckoo-host systems. Five key conclusions can be drawn from these calculations: (1) The contrast of egg phenotypes in hosts significantly reduces cuckoo fitness by reducing the SPR of cuckoos; (2) hosts can minimize the SPR of cuckoos by laying polymorphic eggs with equal proportion of the two morphs if cuckoos also evolve egg dimorphism as a counter-adaptation; (3) the escalation of egg polymorphism in hosts further reduces the SPR in cuckoos, although the efficiency of such an effect decreases with the number of host egg morphs; (4) cuckoos can maximize their SPR by laying a ratio of egg morphs equal to the ratio of host egg morphs; and (5) an increase in the number of cuckoo egg morph does not increase the total SPR of cuckoos for parasitizing hosts with polymorphic eggs. Egg polymorphism in hosts is regarded as a specific adaptation against cuckoo parasitism. Here, we provided a theoretical analysis to show that the disruptive evolution of egg phenotypes in hosts significantly reduces cuckoo fitness by reducing the rate of successful parasitism by cuckoos (SPR). Hosts with obvious egg polymorphism suffer low parasitism rates and they can minimize the SPR of cuckoos by laying polymorphic eggs with equal proportions of the two morphs if cuckoos also evolve egg dimorphism as a counteradaptation, whilst cuckoos can maximize their SPR by laying a ratio of egg morphs equal to the ratio of host egg morphs.

Research has consistently shown that there are major obstacles to moving new knowledge into policy, management, and public domains. New concepts such as Knowledge Exchange (KE) and Knowledge Mobilization (KMb) are being used to investigate these obstacles, but the processes by which potential users evaluate (sometimes competing) knowledge claims remain poorly understood. We use concepts from the sociology of science and find that potential users evaluate new knowledge claims based on three broad criteria: (1) the perceived merits of the claim, (2) perceptions of the character and motivation of the claimant, and (3) considerations of the social and political context of the claim. However, government employees and stakeholders have different interpretations of these criteria, leading to different knowledge preferences and normative expectations of scientists and other claimants. We draw both theoretical and practical lessons from these findings. With respect to theory, we argue that the sociology of science provides valuable insights into the political dimensions of knowledge and should be explicitly incorporated into KE/KMb research. With respect to practice, our findings underline the need for scientists and other claimants to make conscious decisions about whose expectations they hope to meet in their communications and engagement activities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Co-management; Fisheries; Knowledge exchange; Knowledge mobilization; Knowledge perception; Sociology of science","comanagement; decision making; knowledge; perception; policy development; politics; public sector; questionnaire survey; salmonid fishery; social characteristics; stakeholder; Canada; employee; expectation; fishery; government; human; human experiment; interview; motivation; perception; river; scientist; sociology; theoretical model; animal; British Columbia; information dissemination; interpersonal communication; knowledge; organization; perception; politics; procedures; public opinion; salmonine; sociology; British Columbia; Canada; Fraser River; Animals; British Columbia; Canada; Communication; Fisheries; Humans; Information Dissemination; Knowledge; Organizations; Perception; Politics; Public Opinion; Rivers; Salmon; Sociology"

Here, for the first time, we developed a robust methodology to provide unambiguous evidence that egg recognition in the host does not select for optimal egg matching during laying by the cuckoo. By using experiments that attracted parasitism, we showed that cuckoos, Cuculus canorus, indiscriminately laid eggs in oriental reed warbler, Acrocephalus orientalis, host nests containing real host eggs, egg-shaped models, stick models or coin models without any preference. Furthermore, cuckoos only selected to lay their eggs in nests with active hosts. These experiments provide evidence of cuckoos being indiscriminate in their choice of host nests, implying that coevolution of the egg phenotype of host and cuckoo eggs must have arisen from mechanisms other than matching of host eggs and those of the parasite. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","Acrocephalus orientalis; avian brood parasitism; Cuculus canorus; egg mimicry; natural selection","Acrocephalus; Acrocephalus orientalis; Aves; Cuculidae; Cuculus canorus"

Yet, generating accurate measurements of components of the bioenergetics equation in wild fish is a major challenge. How often does a fish eat and what does it consume? How much energy is expended on locomotion? How do human-induced stressors influence energy acquisition and expenditure? Generating answers to these questions is important to fisheries management and to our understanding of adaptation and evolutionary processes. The advent of electronic tags (transmitters and data loggers) has provided biologists with improved opportunities to understand bioenergetics in wild fish. Here, we review the growing diversity of electronic tags with a focus on sensor-equipped devices that are commercially available (e.g., heart rate/electrocardiogram, electromyogram, acceleration, image capture). Next, we discuss each component of the bioenergetics model, recognizing that most research to date has focused on quantifying the activity component of metabolism, and identify ways in which the other, less studied components (e.g., consumption, specific dynamic action component of metabolism, somatic growth, reproductive investment, waste) could be estimated remotely. We conclude with a critical but forward-looking appraisal of the opportunities and challenges in using existing and emerging electronic sensor-tags for the study of fish energetics in the wild.

Despite the wide distribution in the marine ecosystem, very little is known about the toxic impairments on marine organisms, particularly on invertebrates. Thus, we examined the adverse effects of BDE-47 on life history trait (development), oxidative markers, fatty acid composition, and lipid accumulation in response to BDE-47-induced stress in the marine copepod Paracyclopina nana. Also, activation level of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways along with the gene expression profile of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) pathways were addressed. As a result, BDE-47 induced oxidative stress (e.g. reactive oxygen species, ROS) mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling cascades in MAPK pathways. Activated MAPK pathways, in turn, induced signal molecules that bind to the transcription factors (TFs) responsible for lipogenesis to EcR, SREBP, ChREBP promoters. Also, the stress stimulated the conversion of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), a preparedness of the organism to adapt the observed stress, which could be correlated with the elongase and desaturase gene (e.g. ELO3, Δ5-DES, Δ9-DES) expressions, and then extended to the delayed early post-embryonic development and increased accumulation of lipid droplets in P. nana.

Little is known about how food deprivation interacts with other stressors to influence migration success. European populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) exhibit partial migration, whereby a portion of the population smoltifies and migrates to the ocean, and the rest remain in their natal stream. This distinct, natural dichotomy of life-history strategies provides an excellent opportunity to explore the roles of energetic state (as affected by food deprivation) and activation of the glucocorticoid stress response in determining life-history strategy and survival of a migratory species. Using an experimental approach, the relative influences of short-term food deprivation and experimental cortisol elevation (i.e. intra-coelomic injection of cortisol suspended in cocoa butter) on migratory status, survival and growth of juvenile brown trout relative to a control were evaluated. Fewer fish migrated in both the food deprivation and cortisol treatments; however, migration of fish in cortisol and control treatments occurred at the same time while that of fish in the food deprivation treatment was delayed for approximately 1 week. A significantly greater proportion of trout in the food deprivation treatment remained in their natal stream, but unlike the cortisol treatment, there were no long-term negative effects of food deprivation on growth, relative to the control. Overall survival rates were comparable between the food deprivation and control treatments, but significantly lower for fish in the cortisol treatment. Food availability and individual energetic state appear to dictate the future life-history strategy (migrate or remain resident) of juvenile salmonids while experimental elevation of the stress hormone cortisol causes impaired growth and reduced survival of both resident and migratory individuals. © 2016.

Such non-lethal effects include altered timing of reproduction, incidence of reproduction, clutch size and quality of offspring produced. We investigated the effects of goshawks Accipiter gentilis on reproduction of the stock dove Columba oenas in 1723 breeding events during 2006–2015 in Northern Denmark, while simultaneously accounting for effects of climate on reproduction of stock doves. Stock doves were consumed by goshawks 36 times less frequently than expected from their abundance, showing that lethal effects of predation were negligible. Laying date advanced at higher temperatures and stronger winds. Laying was delayed when the population size of goshawks increased, and the effects of goshawks interacted wind speed. The frequency of eggs that did not hatch increased with the population size of goshawks, and with increasing temperatures. Recruitment rate of stock doves decreased with increasing population size of goshawks and stock doves. These findings show that indirect effects of predation by goshawks on stock doves were much larger than direct lethal effects and that climate change interacted with predator–prey interactions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Accipiter gentilis; Columba oenas; Indirect effects; Non-consumption effects of predators; Predator; Predator–prey interactions; Prey","Accipiter gentilis; Aves; Columba oenas; Columbiformes; animal; climate change; Falconiformes; food chain; pigeons and doves; predation; Animals; Climate Change; Columbidae; Falconiformes; Food Chain; Predatory Behavior"

Understanding the performance of acoustic receivers is necessary to distinguish between tagged fish that may have been present but not detected and from those fish that were absent from the area. In this study, two stationary acoustic transmitters were deployed 250 m apart within each of four acoustic receiver lines each containing at least 10 receivers (i.e., eight acoustic transmitters) located in Saginaw Bay and central Lake Huron for nearly 2 years to determine whether the probability of detecting an acoustic transmission varied as a function of time (i.e., season), location, and distance between acoustic transmitter and receiver. Distances between acoustic transmitters and receivers ranged from 200 m to &gt;10 km in each line. The daily observed probability of detecting an acoustic transmission was used in simulation models to estimate the probability of detecting a moving acoustic transmitter on a line of receivers. Results: The probability of detecting an acoustic transmitter on a receiver 1000 m away differed by month for different receiver lines in Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay but was similar for paired acoustic transmitters deployed 250 m apart within the same line. Mean probability of detecting an acoustic transmitter at 1000 m calculated over the study period varied among acoustic transmitters 250 m apart within a line and differed among receiver lines in Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay. The simulated probability of detecting a moving acoustic transmitter on a receiver line was characterized by short periods of time with decreased detection. Although increased receiver spacing and higher fish movement rates decreased simulated detection probability, the location of the simulated receiver line in Lake Huron had the strongest effect on simulated detection probability. Conclusions: Performance of receiver lines in Lake Huron varied across a range of spatiotemporal scales and was inconsistent among receiver lines. Our simulations indicated that if 69 kHz acoustic transmitters operating at 158 dB in 10-30 m of freshwater were being used, then receivers should be placed 1000 m apart to ensure that all fish moving at 1 m s-1 or less will be detected 90% of days over a 2-year period. Whereas these results can be used as general guidelines for designing new studies, the irregular variation in acoustic transmitter detection probabilities we observed among receiver line locations in Lake Huron makes designing receiver lines in similar systems challenging and emphasizes the need to conduct post hoc analyses of acoustic transmitter detection probabilities. © 2016 The Author(s).","Acoustic telemetry; Detection probability; Generalized additive models; Great Lakes; Range testing; Simulation",

As such they are threatened in both developing and developed countries. Indeed, due to lack of reliable data, inland fisheries have never been part of any high profile global fisheries assessment and are notably absent from the Sustainable Development Goals. The general public and policy makers are largely ignorant of the plight of freshwater ecosystems and the fish they support, as well as the ecosystem services generated by inland fisheries. This ignorance is particularly salient given that the current emphasis on the food-water-energy nexus often fails to include the important role that inland fish and fisheries play in food security and supporting livelihoods in low-income food deficit countries. Developing countries in Africa and Asia produce about 11 million tonnes of inland fish annually, 90 % of the global total. The role of inland fisheries goes beyond just kilocalories; fish provide important micronutrients and essentially fatty acids. In some regions, inland recreational fisheries are important, generating much wealth and supporting livelihoods. The following three key recommendations are necessary for action if inland fisheries are to become a part of the food-water-energy discussion: invest in improved valuation and assessment methods, build better methods to effectively govern inland fisheries (requires capacity building and incentives), and develop approaches to managing waters across sectors and scales. Moreover, if inland fisheries are recognized as important to food security, livelihoods, and human well-being, they can be more easily incorporated in regional, national, and global policies and agreements on water issues. Through these approaches, inland fisheries can be better evaluated and be more fully recognized in broader water resource and aquatic ecosystem planning and decision-making frameworks, enhancing their value and sustainability for the future.

The pace-of-life syndrome concept posits that behavioural, physiological and life-history traits coevolve in response to correlated selection pressures, and therefore predicts a positive correlation between boldness (i.e. exploration and risk taking) and metabolic capacity for locomotor performance in individuals. We tested for a pace-of-life syndrome linking boldness and metabolic capacity for locomotor activity in juvenile bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus. Individual fish were screened and classified as bold or shy using an established refuge emergence test. Subsequently, the aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms of bold and shy individuals were quantified using respirometry and by measuring the metabolic by-products of white muscle anaerobic glycolysis following exhaustive exercise, respectively. Bold fish demonstrated 25% greater metabolic scope for activity (i.e. aerobic capacity) than shy fish, which was attributable to a 15% greater maximum metabolic rate. However, there was no significant difference in resting metabolic rate or anaerobic energy expenditure (i.e. anaerobic capacity) between bold and shy fish. These results partially support a pace-of-life syndrome linking boldness and aerobic metabolism in juvenile bluegill sunfish, but did not reveal a link between boldness and anaerobic metabolism. Our findings suggest that aerobic and anaerobic capacities may be subject to different selection pressures, and that physiological processes governing maximum anaerobic performance in fishes are independent from behavioural and physiological traits related to boldness. © 2016","aerobic capacity; anaerobic capacity; behavioural syndrome; locomotor performance; resting metabolic rate","Animalia; Lepomis macrochirus; Pisces"

Increasing development of shoreline habitats leads to increased light pollution (e.g., from cottages, docks, automobile traffic), which could impact the ecology of littoral zones of lakes and rivers. Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) engage in sole paternal care, guarding their nest continually, day and night, to protect their developing offspring. Any alterations to their behaviour—either directly because of the response to light or indirectly due to changes in nest predator activity and associated response of the bass—could lead to increased energetic demands for fish that have a fixed energy budget and ultimately reduce reproductive success. To examine this issue, tri-axial accelerometer biologgers were externally attached to nesting smallmouth bass during the egg stage to determine whether light pollution (i.e., dock lights with low levels of continuous light and spotlights with high intensity irregular light simulating automobile traffic) altered behaviour of nesting males relative to control fish. Our study revealed that both types of light pollution increased overall bass activity level compared with the control group. The intermittent light treatment group had the highest activity and exhibited large fluctuations between night and day activity levels. Fish in the continual light treatment group displayed statistically higher activity than the control fish but showed limited fluctuations between day and night activity levels. Our results suggest that continuous or intermittent light sources, common in shoreline habitats that have been developed, have the potential to alter the behaviour and thus energy use of nest-guarding fish. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on the ecological consequences of light pollution in aquatic ecosystems. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Behavioural alteration; Light pollution; Smallmouth bass","Aquatic ecosystems; Budget control; Docks; Ecology; Ecosystems; Fish; Hydraulic structures; Light sources; Pollution control; River pollution; Speed control; Automobile traffic; Behavioural alteration; Ecological consequences; Intermittent light; Light pollution; Reproductive success; Smallmouth bass; Triaxial accelerometer; Pollution; Micropterus dolomieu; Rumex; Teleostei"

Rarely do they adopt holistic approaches that consider the complex interplay among humans, fish, and the environment. We argue that there is an urgent need for a shift in inland fisheries management towards holistic and transdisciplinary approaches that embrace the principles of social-ecological systems at the watershed scale. The interconnectedness of inland fisheries with their associated watershed (biotic, abiotic, and humans) make them extremely complex and challenging to manage and protect. For this reason, the watershed is a logical management unit. To assist management at this scale, we propose a framework that integrates disparate concepts and management paradigms to facilitate inland fisheries management and sustainability. We contend that inland fisheries need to be managed as social-ecological watershed system (SEWS). The framework supports watershed-scale and transboundary governance to manage inland fisheries, and transdisciplinary projects and teams to ensure relevant and applicable monitoring and research. We discuss concepts of social-ecological feedback and interactions of multiple stressors and factors within/between the social-ecological systems. Moreover, we emphasize that management, monitoring, and research on inland fisheries at the watershed scale are needed to ensure long-term sustainable and resilient fisheries. © 2016","Coupled social-ecological systems; Human behaviour; Inland fisheries; Integrated water resource management; Watershed","water; environmental monitoring; fishery management; holistic approach; human behavior; inland fishery; interdisciplinary approach; sustainable development; transboundary cooperation; water resource; watershed; behavior; ecology; fish; fishery; human; knowledge; nonhuman; Review; watershed; animal; ecosystem; environmental protection; organization and management; research; social environment; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Fishes; Humans; Research; Social Environment"

Radioactivity modifies bacterial communities and, therefore, bird hosts breeding in contaminated areas are expected to adapt to the new bacterial environment. We tested this hypothesis in populations of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from a gradient of background radiation levels at Chernobyl and uncontaminated controls from Denmark. Investment in defenses against keratinolytic bacteria was measured from feather structure (i.e., susceptibility to degradation) and uropygial secretions. We studied degradability of tail feathers from areas varying in contamination in laboratory experiments using incubation of feathers with a feather-degrading bacterium, Bacillus licheniformis, followed by measurement of the amount of keratin digested. The size of uropygial glands and secretion amounts were quantified, followed by antimicrobial tests against B. licheniformis and quantification of wear of feathers. Feathers of males, but not of females, from highly contaminated areas degraded at a lower rate than those from medium and low contamination areas. However, feathers of both sexes from the Danish populations showed little evidence of degradation. Individual barn swallows from the more contaminated areas of Ukraine produced the largest uropygial secretions with higher antimicrobial activity, although wear of feathers did not differ among males from different populations. In Denmark, swallows produced smaller quantities of uropygial secretion with lower antimicrobial activity, which was similar to swallow populations from uncontaminated areas in Ukraine. Therefore, barn swallows breeding in contaminated areas invested more in all defenses against keratinolytic bacteria than in uncontaminated areas of Ukraine and Denmark, although they had similar levels of feather wear. Strong natural selection exerted by radioactivity may have selected for individuals with higher defense capacity against bacterial infections during the 30 years since the Chernobyl disaster. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Antimicrobial defense; Chernobyl; Feather-degrading bacteria; Hirundo rustica; Uropygium","Aves; Bacillus licheniformis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Hirundinidae; Hirundo; Hirundo rustica; keratin; adaptation; animal; Bacillus licheniformis; bodily secretions; Chernobyl accident; Denmark; environmental exposure; exocrine gland; feather; female; genetic selection; male; metabolism; microbiology; pathology; radiation response; sex difference; swallow; Ukraine; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Bacillus licheniformis; Bodily Secretions; Chernobyl Nuclear Accident; Denmark; Environmental Exposure; Exocrine Glands; Feathers; Female; Keratins; Male; Selection, Genetic; Sex Factors; Swallows; Ukraine"

Despite their significant commercial applications, CNTs are being discharged to aquatic ecosystem, leading a threat to aquatic life. Thus, we investigated the adverse effect of CNTs on the marine copepod Paracyclopina nana. Additional to the study on the uptake of CNTs and acute toxicity, adverse effects on life parameters (e.g. growth, fecundity, and size) were analyzed in response to various concentrations of CNTs. Also, as a measurement of cellular damage, oxidative stress-related markers were examined in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, activation of redox-sensitive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways along with the phosphorylation pattern of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNK) were analyzed to obtain a better understanding of molecular mechanism of oxidative stress-induced toxicity in the copepod P. nana. As a result, significant inhibition on life parameters and evoked antioxidant systems were observed without ROS induction. In addition, CNTs activated MAPK signaling pathway via ERK, suggesting that phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK)-mediated adverse effects are the primary cause of in vitro and in vivo endpoints in response to CNTs exposure. Moreover, ROS-independent activation of MAPK signaling pathway was observed. These findings will provide a better understanding of the mode of action of CNTs on the copepod P. nana at cellular and molecular level and insight on possible ecotoxicological implications in the marine environment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Adverse effects; Antioxidant depletion; Copepod; Life parameters; MAPK signaling pathways; MWCNTs; Paracyclopina nana","Copepoda; antioxidant; biological marker; carbon nanotube; mitogen activated protein kinase; reactive oxygen metabolite; stress activated protein kinase; water pollutant; animal; copepod; drug effects; metabolism; oxidative stress; phosphorylation; signal transduction; toxicity; toxicity testing; water pollutant; Western blotting; Animals; Antioxidants; Biomarkers; Blotting, Western; Copepoda; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Nanotubes, Carbon; Oxidative Stress; Phosphorylation; Reactive Oxygen Species; Toxicity Tests, Acute; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Here we investigated the nonconsumptive effects of avian predators on parental care in pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus (L., 1758)) through use of a realistic model of a predatory bird, the Osprey (Pandion haliaetus (L., 1758)). Our predator model exacted dramatic metabolic fright responses and inducible defenses in experimental fish resulting in significant behavioral changes with respect to their parental care. Key parental behaviors including in-nest rotations and egg and nest maintenance were noticeably altered by predator treatments demonstrating as much as an order of magnitude difference in parental performance, suggesting that even transient predation risk might decrease reproductive fitness.

PCB-126 (3,3′,4,4′,5-pentachlorobiphenyl) accumulates in lipids and can subsequently be released into the bloodstream during periods of high activity that involve the mobilization of stored fuels to meet with increasing energy demands. The goal of this study was to determine if a sublethal exposure to PCB-126 altered the content of tissue energy supplies (carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, triglycerides) and impaired swimming performance as well as oxygen consumption in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Trout were injected intraperitoneally with a single Low (100 μg kg− 1) or High (400 μg kg− 1) dose of PCB-126 then swimming performance and metabolic rates from 1 to 9 days post-injection were compared to Control (non-dosed) fish. Liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was assessed as an indication of PCB-126 intoxication while plasma and white muscle tissue metabolites were analyzed as an index of physiological disturbance. Swimming performance, assessed using two successive modified critical swimming speed (Ucrit) tests, was highest for fish in the High PCB-126 treatment; however, their initial condition factor (K) was also higher, largely due to their greater body mass. Trout in the High and Low PCB-126 treatments exhibited impaired recovery following intense exercise as they swam comparatively poorly when provided a second challenge. PCB-exposed fish exhibited reduced spleen somatic indices as well as muscle glucose and glycogen contents; whereas plasma cortisol and glucose levels were elevated, indicating higher metabolic costs during recovery and muscle restoration.

In addition, anthropogenic impacts on habitats, widespread presence of non-native species and the frequent use of enhancement and restoration measures such as stocking affect stock dynamics. This paper outlines various stock assessment and data collection approaches that can be adapted to a wide range of different inland fisheries and management challenges. Although this paper identifies challenges in assessment, it focuses on solutions that are practical, scalable and transferrable. A path forward is suggested in which biological assessment generates some of the critical information needed by fisheries managers to make effective decisions that benefit the resource and stakeholders. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Assessment tools; Fisheries management; Inland fisheries; Sustainable fisheries",

Technology can be used to mitigate the loss of fish associated with such infrastructure by exploiting the sensory physiology of a species through stimuli designed to manipulate their natural behaviors (e.g., to attract or repel). Technologies used for behavioral guidance often incorporate light; however, previous studies investigating light devices have focused on mercury vapor bulbs and thus have been limited in their exploration of the broader light spectra. Innovations in light-emitting diode (LED) technology provide opportunities for manipulating light spectra (i.e., color) as well as light-pulse frequency. We tested the behavioral response of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides under 16 different LED color and light-pulse frequency combinations as well as in a control in which no light was emitted. Red, orange, yellow, and green were considered with four light-pulse frequencies (0, 120, 300, and 600 pulses/min). Using a large shallow arena, lateral fish movement in response to the light treatments was examined. Regardless of color or light-pulse frequency, fish were repelled by the light source. In contrast, when there was no light emitted, fish were evenly distributed throughout the arena. This work suggests that colored light accompanied with light-pulse frequencies produced by LEDs can induce an avoidance response in Largemouth Bass. © American Fisheries Society 2016.",,"Micropterus; Micropterus salmoides; Teleostei"

NK cells display rapid and potent immunity to metastasis or hematological cancers, and major efforts are now being undertaken to fully exploit NK cell anti-tumor properties in the clinic. Diverse approaches encompass the development of large-scale NK cell-expansion protocols for adoptive transfer, the establishment of a microenvironment favorable to NK cell activity, the redirection of NK cell activity against tumor cells and the release of inhibitory signals that limit NK cell function.

The dependence of microplastic toxicity on particle size was investigated by measuring several in vivo end points and studying the ingestion and egestion using 0.05-, 0.5-, and 6-μm nonfunctionalized polystyrene microbeads. To identify the defense mechanisms activated in response to microplastic exposure, the activities of several antioxidant-related enzymes and the phosphorylation status of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were determined. Exposure to polystyrene microbeads of all sizes led to significant size-dependent effects, including reduced growth rate, reduced fecundity, decreased lifespan and longer reproduction time. Rotifers exposed to 6-μm fluorescently labeled microbeads exhibited almost no fluorescence after 24 h, while rotifers exposed to 0.05- and 0.5-μm fluorescently labeled microbeads displayed fluorescence until 48 h, suggesting that 6-μm microbeads are more effectively egested from B. koreanus than 0.05- or 0.5-μm microbeads.

Sublethal alterations to behaviour with potential individual fitness costs are a possible consequence of catch-and-release but are difficult to measure empirically relative to uncaptured fish. To test for sublethal effects of angling on migratory movements, 39 salmon were captured by recreational anglers, externally tagged with radio transmitters, and released. Data from the annual visual drift count of spawning salmon were used to calculate the probability of spawning in each pool of the river and input into simulation models. Simulation models were used to test the hypothesis that catch-and-release did not affect the upriver movement of 30 salmon tracked to spawning grounds. Ten thousand simulation steps selected a spawning pool for each of the tagged salmon, permitting a calculation of the average expected movement by salmon for comparison to the average movement observed with telemetry. The average observed movement by the released salmon was significantly less than the average expected movement generated by all three null models, indicating a sublethal effect of catch-and-release on the migration of Atlantic salmon. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Angling; Recreational fisheries; Simulation; Sublethal effects; Telemetry","Radio transmission; Telemetering; Telemetering equipment; Angling; Catch and release; Migratory movements; Recreational fisheries; Simulation; Simulation approach; Spawning grounds; Sub-lethal effects; Fisheries; angling; catchability; fishery management; migration; salmonid; salmonid culture; simulation; spawning; sublethal effect; telemetry; Atlantic Ocean; Salmo salar"

Decreased metastasis upon A2BR inhibition is independent of host A2BR and lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Knockdown of A2BR on mouse and human cancer cells reduces their metastasis in vivo and decreases their viability and colony-forming ability, while transiently delaying cell-cycle arrest in vitro. The prometastatic activity of adenosine is partly tumor A2BR dependent and independent of host A2BR expression. In humans, TNBC cell lines express higher A2BR than luminal and Her2+ breast cancer cell lines, and high expression of A2BR is associated with worse prognosis in TNBC.

Such anthropogenic areas have specific environmental characteristics, which influence the physiology, life history, and population dynamics of plants and animals. For example, the date of bud burst is advanced in urban compared to nearby natural areas. In some birds, breeding success is determined by synchrony between timing of breeding and peak food abundance. Pertinently, caterpillars are an important food source for the nestlings of many bird species, and their abundance is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and date of bud burst. Higher temperatures and advanced date of bud burst in urban areas could advance peak caterpillar abundance and thus affect breeding phenology of birds. In order to test whether laying date advance and clutch sizes decrease with the intensity of urbanization, we analyzed the timing of breeding and clutch size in relation to intensity of urbanization as a measure of human impact in 199 nest box plots across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East (i.e., the Western Palearctic) for four species of hole-nesters: blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), great tits (Parus major), collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). Meanwhile, we estimated the intensity of urbanization as the density of buildings surrounding study plots measured on orthophotographs. For the four study species, the intensity of urbanization was not correlated with laying date. Clutch size in blue and great tits does not seem affected by the intensity of urbanization, while in collared and pied flycatchers it decreased with increasing intensity of urbanization. This is the first large-scale study showing a species-specific major correlation between intensity of urbanization and the ecology of breeding. The underlying mechanisms for the relationships between life history and urbanization remain to be determined. We propose that effects of food abundance or quality, temperature, noise, pollution, or disturbance by humans may on their own or in combination affect laying date and/or clutch size. © 2016 The Authors.

Understanding age-specific patterns of parasite infections is crucial for quantifying the fitness consequences of parasitism for hosts and for understanding parasite transmission dynamics. We analyzed longitudinal and cross-sectional infection data in house martins Delichon urbica, a migratory bird suffering from intense haemosporidian infection. We separated within- from among-individual effects of age on prevalence. Our results showed that the probability of blood parasite infection increased as individual house martins aged. We also showed that the prevalence of infection decreased with age at last reproduction when controlling for age, showing a selective disappearance of infected birds from the population (i.e. selection). The estimated effect of age on prevalence was underestimated two- to three-fold if not accounting for such selection. This study highlights the importance of taking among-individual heterogeneity in the capacity to fight a disease into account because such heterogeneity can mask age-related patterns of infection.

However, the nature and perception of shark encounters – a fundamental precursor to future research, management and conservation measures aimed to increase shark survival – is not well documented in recreational fisheries. Five hundred and ninety recreational saltwater anglers responded to the survey and reported their experiences targeting or incidentally catching sharks, as well as their attitudes toward sharks, shark fishing techniques, and shark conservation and management. The survey found sharks were caught regularly, with 57% of respondents commonly targeting sharks and 93% of respondents having caught a shark at least once. Eighty-eight percent of the respondents released the last shark that they caught and most respondents often or always practised catch-and-release when catching sharks. The survey revealed that avid anglers have positive attitudes toward sharks and shark conservation and have a desire to handle and release sharks in ways that will increase their likelihood of survival. However, the survey also revealed that there are a variety of situational factors (e.g. target fish, fishing platform) that influence the choices that anglers make while fishing, which may influence adherence to catch-and-release methods. Based on their positive attitudes toward sharks, recreational anglers may be strong allies for the development, dissemination, and adoption of species and situational-specific best practice catch-and-release guidelines for this group of fishes within the wider recreational saltwater angling community.

Observed climate change effects on physiological systems are varied and numerous, including exceedance of critical thermal tolerances, decreased cardiorespiratory performance, compromised immune function, and altered patterns of individual reproductive investment.

In Norway, inland recreational fisheries are co-managed by the government and by local riparian rights holders, meaning that Atlantic salmon Salmo salar harvest restrictions differ somewhat among rivers. Data from Norwegian rivers from 2009 to 2013 were used to test for variation in the proportion of salmon released by anglers and the relative size of salmon harvested and released by anglers in rivers that had varying harvest restrictions in terms of quotas, size restrictions, and/or female harvest restrictions. The proportion of the catch released by anglers was higher in rivers where there were harvest restrictions (proportion released = 0.09-0.24) than in rivers with no such restrictions (proportion released = 0.01). On average, salmon released in rivers with size restrictions larger (average mass difference between harvested and released salmon = -1.25 kg) than those released in rivers without harvest restrictions (difference = 0.60 kg). The proportion of the catch released was larger in rivers with seasonal quotas (0.29) than in rivers with daily (0.07) or collective (i.e. total catch for the river; 0.06) quotas. Rivers with low daily (one salmon per angler per day) or seasonal (<5 salmon per angler per year) quotas had a larger proportion of salmon released (0.23, 0.38, respectively) than rivers with moderate (0.10, 0.21) or high (0.07, 0.16) quotas. High seasonal quotas resulted in larger individuals harvested than released (difference = 1.16 kg), on average, compared to moderate (1.22 kg) and high seasonal quotas (-0.30 kg).

We collected diseased flowers of Silene latifolia from locations ranging by more than two orders of magnitude in background radiation, from 0.05 to 21.03 μGy/h. Disease prevalence decreased significantly with increasing radiation level, possibly due to lower pollinator abundance and altered pollinator behaviour. Viability and fertility, measured as the budding rate of haploid sporidia following meiosis from the diploid teliospores, did not vary with increasing radiation levels and neither did karyotype overall structure and level of chromosomal size heterozygosity. We sequenced the genomes of twelve samples from Chernobyl and of four samples collected from uncontaminated areas and analysed alignments of 6068 predicted genes, corresponding to 1.04 × 107 base pairs. We found no dose-dependent differences in substitution rates (neither dN, dS, nor dN/dS). Thus, we found no significant evidence of increased deleterious mutation rates at higher levels of background radiation in this plant pathogen. We even found lower levels of nonsynonymous substitution rates in contaminated areas compared to control regions, suggesting that purifying selection was stronger in contaminated than uncontaminated areas.

Here we tested the hypothesis that cuckoo calls are reliable indicators of environmental and individual quality by determining the number of repeated 'cuckoo' syllables in calls in relation to habitat and soil, ionizing radiation, presence of a female cuckoo and local density of male cuckoos at Chernobyl, Ukraine. Males were consistent in their production of syllables, producing more syllables per call when a female or another male arrived. This increase in the number of syllables was larger in males that already produced many syllables in the absence of conspecifics, implying that males of superior quality were still able to increase the number of syllables. Males produced more syllables per call in habitats with black soil and in forests. Furthermore, they produced fewer and more aberrant syllables in radioactively contaminated areas of Chernobyl providing evidence of an effect of environmental perturbation on the number of syllables. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the number of syllables is a condition-dependent signal used for attracting mates, repelling competitors, providing information about local environmental conditions for other cuckoos, but also for humans and thus can be used by humans to infer habitat quality. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Advertisement calls; Chernobyl; Cuckoo; Cuculus canorus; Habitat quality; Radioactivity; Species richness","Ionizing radiation; Radioactivity; Soils; Advertisement calls; Chernobyl; Cuckoo; Cuculus canorus; Habitat quality; Species richness; Ecosystems; Cuculidae; Cuculus canorus"

We identified cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS, encoded by Cish) as a critical negative regulator of IL-15 signaling in NK cells. Cish was rapidly induced in response to IL-15, and deletion of Cish rendered NK cells hypersensitive to IL-15, as evidenced by enhanced proliferation, survival, IFN-γ production and cytotoxicity toward tumors. This was associated with increased JAK-STAT signaling in NK cells in which Cish was deleted. Correspondingly, CIS interacted with the tyrosine kinase JAK1, inhibiting its enzymatic activity and targeting JAK for proteasomal degradation. Cish -/- mice were resistant to melanoma, prostate and breast cancer metastasis in vivo, and this was intrinsic to NK cell activity.

Some salmonid species and populations, for example, have been reported to exhibit different thermal profiles for theirAScurves such that ASpeaks around the modal river temperature encountered during the upriver spawning migration, suggesting species- and population-level adaptations to river temperature regimes. Interestingly, some other salmonid species and populations have been reported to exhibit AS curves that maintain an upwards trajectory throughout the ecologically relevant temperature range rather than peaking at a modal temperature. To shed further light on this apparent dichotomy, we used adult coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to test the prediction that peak AS coincides with populationspecific, historically experienced river temperatures. We assessed AS at 10 and 15°C, which represent a typical river migration temperature and the upper limit of the historically experienced temperature range, respectively. We also examined published data on AS in juvenile coho salmon in relation to new temperature data measured from their freshwater rearing environments. In both cases, AS was either maintained or increased modestly throughout the range of ecologically relevant temperatures. In light of existing evidence and the new data presented here, we suggest that when attempting to understand thermal optimafor Pacific salmonand other species across life stages, AS is a useful metric of oxygen transport capacity but other thermally sensitive physiological indices of performance and fitness should be considered in concert. © 2016.

A higher dose of WAFs significantly reduced the fecundity and lifespan. A rotifer 32K microarray chip showed that the Bk-CYP3045C1 gene had the highest expression. Of the 25 entire CYP genes, the Bk-CYP3045C1 gene showed a significant expression for different doses and times in response to WAFs and chemical components of WAFs (naphthalene and phenanthrene); also, glutathione S-transferase genes, ABC transporter, and other genes showed dose responses upon exposure to 80% WAF over time. Different doses of WAFs increased the oxidative stress with an induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a depletion of glutathione (GSH). Exposure to WAFs did not show toxic effects on survivability in B. koreanus; however, toxicity to WAFs was shown when piperonyl butoxide, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, was added.

Using acoustic transmitters and fixed receiver arrays across four years (2010-2013), we tracked the migration of >1850 wild sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) smolts from Chilko Lake, British Columbia, to the coastal Pacific Ocean (>1000 km distance). Cumulative survival to the ocean ranged 3-10% among years, although this may be slightly underestimated due to technical limitations at the final receiver array. Distinct spatial patterns in both behavior and survival were observed through all years. In small, clear, upper-river reaches, downstream migration largely occurred at night at speeds up to 50 km/d and coincided with poor survival. Among years, only 57-78% of smolts survived the first 80 km. Parallel laboratory experiments revealed excellent short-term survival and unhindered swimming performance of dummy-tagged smolts, suggesting that predators rather than tagging effects were responsible for the initial high mortality of acoustic-tagged smolts. Migration speeds increased in the Fraser River mainstem (∼220 km/d in some years), diel movement patterns ceased, and smolt survival generally exceeded 90% in this segment. Marine movement rates and survival were variable across years, with among-year segment-specific survival being the most variable and lowest (19-61%) during the final (and longest, 240 km) marine migration segment. Osmoregulatory preparedness was not expected to influence marine survival, as smolts could maintain normal levels of plasma chloride when experimentally exposed to saltwater (30 ppt) immediately upon commencing their migration from Chilko Lake. Transportation of smolts downstream generally increased survival to the farthest marine array. The act of tagging may have affected smolts in the marine environment in some years as dummy-tagged fish had poorer survival than control fish when transitioned to saltwater in laboratory-based experiments. Current fisheries models for forecasting the number of adult sockeye returning to spawn have been inaccurate in recent years and generally do not incorporate juvenile or smolt survival information. Our results highlight significant potential for early migration conditions to influence adult recruitment. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","Acoustic telemetry; British Columbia; Canada; Canada; Chilko Lake; Fraser River watershed; Migration; Pacific salmon; Predation","acoustic survey; biotelemetry; diel migration; marine environment; migratory behavior; mortality; osmoregulation; salmonid; spatial distribution; spawning ground; survival; watershed; wild population; British Columbia; British Columbia; Canada; Chilko Lake; Fraser River; Pacific Coast [Canada]; Pacific Coast [North America]; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus nerka; animal; animal identification; Canada; circadian rhythm; mortality; Pacific Ocean; physiology; population migration; river; salmonine; time factor; wild animal; Animal Identification Systems; Animal Migration; Animals; Animals, Wild; Canada; Circadian Rhythm; Mortality; Pacific Ocean; Rivers; Salmon; Time Factors"

Hosts may sometimes mistakenly reject own eggs when they are not parasitized (i.e. make recognition errors). Such errors would incur fitness costs and could counter the evolution of host defences driven by costs of parasitism (i.e. creating equilibrium between acceptors and rejecters within particular host populations). In the present study, we report the disappearance of host eggs from nonparasitized nests in populations of seven actual and potential hosts of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus. Based on these data, we calculate the magnitude of the balancing parasitism rate provided that all eggs lost are a result of recognition errors. Importantly, because eggs are known to disappear from nests for reasons other than erroneous host rejection, our data represent the maximum estimates of such costs. Nonetheless, the disappearance of eggs was a rare event and therefore incurred low costs compared to the high costs of parasitism. Hence, costs as a result of recognition errors are probably of minor importance with respect to opposing selective pressure for the evolution of egg rejection in these hosts. We cannot exclude the possibility that low or intermediate egg rejection rates in some host populations may be caused by spatiotemporal variation in the occurrence of parasitism and gene flow, creating a variable influence of opposing costs as a result of recognition errors and the costs of parasitism. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London.","Co-evolution; Cuckoo; Fitness cost; Host defence; Host-parasite interactions","bird; brood parasitism; coevolution; defense mechanism; egg rejection; equilibrium; evolutionary theory; fitness; host-parasite interaction; recognition; reproductive cost; Aves; Cuculus canorus"

We showed that clusters of populations sharing breeding and wintering ranges varied from partial (British Isles and Western Europe, NW cluster) to completely migratory (Scandinavia and north-eastern Europe, NE cluster). Distance migrated by birds of the NE (but not of the NW) cluster decreased through time because of a north-eastwards shift in the wintering grounds. Moreover, when winter temperatures in the breeding areas were cold, individuals from the NE cluster also migrated longer distances, while those of the NW cluster moved over shorter distances.

The uropygial gland is an exocrine gland that produces antimicrobial and antifungal secretions with properties used as a defensive barrier on skin and plumage. This secretion has been proposed to affect the interaction between avian hosts and their ectoparasites. Because uropygial secretions may constitute a defense mechanism against ectoparasites, this may result in a reduction in prevalence of blood parasites that are transmitted by ectoparasitic vectors. Furthermore, other studies pointed out that vectors could be attracted by uropygial secretions and hence increase the probability of becoming infected. Here we explored the relationship between uropygial gland size, antimicrobial activity of uropygial secretions and malaria infection in house sparrows Passer domesticus. Methods: A nested-PCR was used to identify blood parasites infection. Flow cytometry detecting absolute cell counting assessed antimicrobial activity of the uropygial gland secretion Results: Uninfected house sparrows had larger uropygial glands and higher antimicrobial activity in uropygial secretions than infected individuals. We found a positive association between uropygial gland size and scaled body mass index, but only in uninfected sparrows. Female house sparrows had larger uropygial glands and higher antimicrobial activity of gland secretions than males. Conclusion: These findings suggest that uropygial gland secretions may play an important role as a defensive mechanism against malaria infection. © 2016 Magallanes et al.","Antimicrobial activity; Flow cytometry; Haemosporidian parasites; Passer domesticus; Preen gland","adult; anthropometric parameters; antimicrobial activity; Article; bacterial growth; blood sampling; body mass; cell counting; controlled study; defense mechanism; exocrine gland; female; flow cytometry; host parasite interaction; malaria; male; nonhuman; organ size; parasite examination; parasite identification; Passer domesticus; polymerase chain reaction; secretion (process); Staphylococcus epidermidis; uropygial gland; animal; avian malaria; bodily secretions; metabolism; parasitology; sex difference; sparrow; antiinfective agent; Animals; Anti-Infective Agents; Bodily Secretions; Female; Malaria, Avian; Male; Sex Factors; Sparrows"

In this study, we have demonstrated that blocking CD96 with a monoclonal antibody inhibited experimental metastases in three different tumor models. The antimetastatic activity of anti-CD96 was dependent on NK cells, CD226 (DNAM-1), and IFN?, but independent of activating Fc receptors. Anti-CD96 was more effective in combination with anti–CTLA-4, anti–PD-1, or doxorubicin chemotherapy. Blocking CD96 in Tigit-/- mice significantly reduced experimental and spontaneous metastases compared with its activity in wild-type mice. Co-blockade of CD96 and PD-1 potently inhibited lung metastases, with the combination increasing local NK-cell IFN? production and infiltration. Overall, these data demonstrate that blocking CD96 is a new and complementary immunotherapeutic strategy to reduce tumor metastases.

To test this hypothesis, we surveyed the scientific literature on the effects of chronic low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) on antioxidant responses and oxidative damage. We found 40 publications and 212 effect sizes for antioxidant responses and 288 effect sizes for effects of oxidative damage. We performed a meta-analysis of signed and unsigned effect sizes. We found large unsigned effects for both categories (0.918 for oxidative damage 0.973 for antioxidant response). Mean signed effect size weighted by sample size was 0.276 for oxidative damage and - 0.350 for antioxidant defenses, with significant heterogeneity among effects for both categories, implying that ionizing radiation caused small to intermediate increases in oxidative damage and small to intermediate decreases in antioxidant defenses. Our estimates are robust, as shown by very high fail-safe numbers. Species, biological matrix (tissue, blood, sperm) and age predicted the magnitude of effects for oxidative damage as well as antioxidant response. Meta-regression models showed that effect sizes for oxidative damage varied among species and age classes, while effect sizes for antioxidant responses varied among species and biological matrices.

Inherent challenges exist with the assessment of fish populations because they are moving targets. We submit that quantifying and describing the spatial ecology of fish and their habitat is an important component of freshwater fishery assessment and management. With a growing number of tools available for studying the spatial ecology of fishes (e.g., telemetry, population genetics, hydroacoustics, otolith microchemistry, stable isotope analysis), new knowledge can now be generated and incorporated into biological assessment and fishery management. For example, knowing when, where, and how to deploy assessment gears is essential to inform, refine, or calibrate assessment protocols. Such information is also useful for quantifying or avoiding bycatch of imperiled species. Knowledge of habitat connectivity and usage can identify critically important migration corridors and habitats and can be used to improve our understanding of variables that influence spatial structuring of fish populations. Similarly, demographic processes are partly driven by the behavior of fish and mediated by environmental drivers. Information on these processes is critical to the development and application of realistic population dynamics models. Collectively, biological assessment, when informed by knowledge of spatial ecology, can provide managers with the ability to understand how and when fish and their habitats may be exposed to different threats.

To examine the biomarker potential of the self-fertilizing killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus Vtgs (Km-Vtgs), full genomic DNAs of Km-Vtgs-Aa, Km-Vtgs-Ab, and Km-Vtgs-C were cloned, sequenced, and characterized. Three Vtg genes in K. marmoratus are tandemly placed in a 550 kb section of the same chromosome. In silico analysis of promoter regions revealed that both the Km-Vtgs-Aa and Km-Vtgs-Ab genes had an estrogen response element (ERE), but the Km-Vtgs-C gene did not. However, all three Km-Vtgs genes had several ERE-half sites in their promoter regions. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the three deduced amino acid residues were highly conserved with conventional Vtgs protein, forming distinctive clades within teleost Vtgs. Liver tissue showed the highest expression of Km-Vtg transcripts in all tested tissues (brain/pituitary, eye, gonad, intestine, skin, and muscle) in response to endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC)-exposed conditions. Km-Vtg transcripts were significantly increased in response to 17β-estradiol (E2), tamoxifen (TMX), 4-n-nonylphenol (NP), bisphenol A (BPA), and octylphenol (OP) over 24 hr exposure. The Km-Vtg-A gene was highly expressed compared to the control in response to NP and OP. EDC-induced modulatory patterns of Km-Vtg gene expression were different depending on tissue, gender, and isoforms. © 2015.","Endocrine disrupting chemical; Kryptolebias marmoratus; Vitellogenin","Biomarkers; Chemicals; Cloning; Gene expression; Genes; Proteins; Tissue; Aquatic environments; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Estrogen response elements; Genomic organization; Kryptolebias marmoratus; Phylogenetic analysis; Transcriptional modulation; Vitellogenin; Endocrine disrupters; autogamy; biomarker; DNA; endocrine disruptor; finfish; genome; physiological response; protein; Cyprinodontoidei; Kryptolebias marmoratus; Teleostei; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; 4-nonylphenol; benzhydryl derivative; endocrine disruptor; estradiol; octylphenol; phenol derivative; tamoxifen; vitellogenin; water pollutant; animal; drug effects; gene expression; genetics; killifish; physiology; toxicity; water pollutant; Animals; Benzhydryl Compounds; Endocrine Disruptors; Estradiol; Gene Expression; Killifishes; Phenols; Tamoxifen; Vitellogenins; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

We only found one experimental study showing evidence of improved resistance to radiation.

Prey would therefore benefit by adjusting their behaviour to the risk of predation, while predators conversely would benefit from adjusting their behaviour to that of their prey. Extravagant ornamentation has evolved to attract mates and/or successfully compete with conspecifics of the same sex to secure high mating success, even if that occurs at a cost of increased risk of predation. Thus, sexually dichromatic species may be more susceptible to predation than sexually monochromatic species, and the presence of compensation is indicative of such species being more vulnerable. If extravagant ornamentation is costly in terms of predation risk, then we should expect sexually dichromatic species to have longer flight initiation distances (FID) than sexually monochromatic species. If ornamentation is acquired as a handicap with only individuals in prime condition being able to display with the smallest viability cost, we should expect sexually dichromatic individuals to have shorter FID than sexually monochromatic individuals. Such differences among individuals should, on an evolutionary time scale, translate into differences in FID being related to differences in sexual dichromatism among species. We investigated the relationship between FID and sexual dichromatism in phylogenetic analyses, while accounting for effects of continent (Australia, North America, and Europe), body mass, the interaction between sexual dichromatism and body mass and the interaction between sexual dichromatism and continent. In an analysis of 447 species we found shorter FID in sexually dichromatic than in sexually monochromatic species (consistent with the handicap hypothesis because sexually dichromatic species took greater risks), especially so at large body size. FID differed among continents and the relative difference in FID between sexually monochromatic and sexually dichromatic species was larger in Europe than in Australia and North America. These differences among continents may be attributed to latitudinal effects of predation. These findings are important for current ideas about the evolution of secondary sexual characters because they imply covarying continental differences in predation, especially for large bodied sexually dichromatic species. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London.","Latitudinal clines in predation; Predation risk; Sexual coloration; Sexual selection","Aves"

Currently, the relationship between stream habitat quality and fish condition remains poorly understood. The use of physiological metrics such as glucocorticoids (GCs) provides a useful tool for quantifying these effects by relating the health of resident fishes to stream quality. To date, however, most studies that measure GC levels tend to focus on a single, large-bodied species, rather than evaluating how GCs may be influenced differently between species in a community. In this study, we measured cortisol, the glucocorticoid found in fishes, from fish tissues to quantify effects of habitat degradation on the glucocorticoid function of five species of juvenile and small-bodied stream fish which differ ecologically and phylogenetically. Largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, brown bullhead Ameiurus nebulosus, white sucker Catostomus commersonii, pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus, and logperch Percina caprodes were sampled from a reference and a degraded stream. Upon capture, fish were either euthanized immediately, to quantify baseline stress parameters, or following a standardized stressor, to quantify GC responsiveness. As a result of stream degradation largemouth bass possessed altered baseline GC concentrations and brown bullhead and logperch had altered GC responses to a stressor. White sucker and pumpkinseed did not demonstrate any alteration in baseline or post-stress GC concentrations. Together, our results show that different species residing in identical habitats can demonstrate a variety of responses to environmental stress, highlighting the variation in physiological ability to cope under poor environmental conditions, as well as the difficulty of predicting GC dynamics in wild animals. Understanding the relationships between GC function, habitat quality, and population-level processes will increase the ability of researchers and managers to predict how fish communities and aquatic ecosystems will be shaped by anthropogenic environmental change. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Community; Conservation physiology; Habitat quality; Macrophysiology; Stress; Whole-body cortisol","Aquatic ecosystems; Aquatic organisms; Cortisol; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Hormones; Physiological models; Physiology; Stresses; Tissue; Community; Environmental change; Environmental conditions; Environmental stress; Habitat degradation; Habitat quality; Macrophysiology; Whole body; Fish; glucocorticoid; hydrocortisone; glucocorticoid; water pollutant; anthropogenic effect; bioindicator; fish; habitat fragmentation; habitat quality; hormone; physiological response; steroid; streamwater; water quality; Ameiurus nebulosus; animal tissue; Article; biodegradation; Catostomus commersonii; chemical parameters; chronic stress; comparative study; controlled study; environmental change; environmental stress; fish; habiatat degradation; habitat quality; largemouth bass; Lepomis gibbosus; neighborhood; nonhuman; Percina caprodes; phenotypic plasticity; phylogeny; priority journal; species difference; stream (river); tissue level; water quality; analysis; animal; environmental monitoring; fish; metabolism; toxicity; water pollutant; Ameiurus nebulosus; Animalia; Catostomus commersoni; Catostomus commersonii; Cottus gobio; Lepomis gibbosus; Micropterus; Micropterus salmoides; Percina caprodes; Pisces; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Glucocorticoids; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Each bacterial community was exposed to four different Î 3 radiation doses ranging from 0.46 to 3.96 kGy to test whether chronic exposure to radiation had selected for resistant bacterial strains. Experimental radiation duration had an increasingly overall negative effect on the survival of all bacterial communities. After exposure to 3 radiation, bacteria isolated from the site with intermediate background radiation levels survived better and produced more colonies than the bacterial communities from other study sites with higher or lower background radiation levels.

In this study, we demonstrate the superior effect of a combination of CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397 and BRAF inhibitor, PLX4720, in suppressing primary and metastatic mouse BRAFV600Emelanoma. Using flow cytometry to assess SM1WT1 melanoma-infiltrating leukocytes immediately post therapy, we found that PLX3397 reduced the recruitment of CD11b+Gr1loand CD11b+Gr1intM2-like macrophages, but this was accompanied by an accumulation of CD11b+Gr1hicells. PDL1 expression on remaining myeloid cells potentially dampened the antitumor efficacy of PLX3397 and PLX4720 in combination, since PD1/PDL1 axis blockade improved outcome. We also reveal a role for PLX3397 in reducing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and interestingly, this feature was rescued by the co-administration of PLX4720.

With a growing number of researchers working on fish in the field and expanding mandates of IACUCs to regulate field work, there is potential for interactions between aquatic biologists and IACUCs to result in unexpected challenges and misunderstandings. Here we raise a number of issues often encountered by researchers and suggest that they should be taken into consideration by IACUCs when dealing with projects that entail the examination of fish in their natural environment or other field settings. We present these perspectives as ten practical realities along with their implications for establishing IACUC protocols. The ten realities are: (1) fish are diverse; (2) scientific collection permit regulations may conflict with IACUC policies; (3) stakeholder credibility and engagement may constrain what is possible; (4) more (sample size) is sometimes better; (5) anesthesia is not always needed or possible; (6) drugs such as analgesics and antibiotics should be prescribed with care; (7) field work is inherently dynamic; (8) wild fish are wild; (9) individuals are different, and (10) fish capture, handling, and retention are often constrained by logistics. These realities do not imply ignorance on the part of IACUCs, but simply different training and experiences that make it difficult for one to understand what happens outside of the lab where fish are captured and not ordered/purchased/reared, where there are engaged stakeholders, and where there is immense diversity (in size, morphology, behaviour, life-history, physiological tolerances) such that development of rigid protocols or extrapolation from one species (or life-stage, sex, size class, etc.) to another is difficult. We recognize that underlying these issues is a need for greater collaboration between IACUC members (including veterinary professionals) and field researchers which would provide more reasoned, rational and useful guidance to improve or maintain the welfare status of fishes used in field research while enabling researchers to pursue fundamental and applied questions related to the biology of fish in the field. As such, we hope that these considerations will be widely shared with the IACUCs of concerned researchers. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Animal care; Ethics; Field research; Welfare","animal welfare; ethics; fieldwork; fish; institutional framework; Animalia; Pisces; Vertebrata"

The acute toxicity of copper decreased significantly with a decrease in copper bioavailability resulting from MWCNT exposure. Furthermore, we examined the effects of MWCNT exposure on reproductive capacity, population growth rate, growth patterns, antioxidant systems, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Reproductive capacity, population growth rate, and body growth rate were significantly suppressed in B. koreanus in response to 1.3-4. mg/L MWCNT exposure. Furthermore, MWCNTs induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased the antioxidant enzymatic activities of catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR). However, the enzymatic activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) was up-regulated after a 24 h-exposure to 100 mg/L MWCNTs. Exposure to 100 mg/L MCWNTs induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in B. koreanus, suggesting that p-ERK may mediate the adverse effects of MWCNTs in B. koreanus via the MAPK signaling pathway.

There are many types of immune processes involving different antitumour and tumour-promoting leucocytes, and tumour cells use many strategies to evade the immune response. The tumour microenvironment can help determine which immune suppressive pathways become activated to restrain antitumour immunity. This includes immune checkpoint receptors on effector T-cells and myeloid cells, and release of inhibitory cytokines and metabolites. Therapeutic approaches that target these pathways, particularly immune-checkpoint receptors, can induce durable antitumour responses in patients with advanced-stage cancers, including melanoma. Nevertheless, many patients do not have a good response to monotherapy approaches and alternative strategies are required to achieve optimal therapeutic benefit. These strategies include eliminating the bulk of tumour cells to provoke tumour-antigen release and antigen-presenting cell (APC) function, using adjuvants to enhance APC function, and using agents that enhance effector-cell activity. In this Review, we discuss the stratification of the tumour microenvironment according to tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression in the tumour, and how this stratification enables the design of optimal combination cancer therapies tailored to target different tumour microenvironments. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We provide genetic, pharmacologic, and biochemical evidence that a critical target of TGF-β signaling in mouse and human natural killer (NK) cells is the serine and threonine kinase mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Treatment of mouse or human NK cells with TGF-β in vitro blocked interleukin-15 (IL-15)-induced activation of mTOR. TGF-β and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin both reduced themetabolic activity and proliferation of NK cells and reduced the abundances of various NK cell receptors and the cytotoxic activity of NK cells. In vivo, constitutive TGF-β signaling or depletion of mTOR arrested NK cell development, whereas deletion of the TGF-β receptor subunit TGF-βRII enhanced mTOR activity and the cytotoxic activity of the NK cells in response to IL-15. Suppression of TGF-β signaling in NK cells did not affect either NK cell development or homeostasis; however, it enhanced the ability of NK cells to limit metastases in two different tumor models in mice. Together, these results suggest that the kinase mTOR is a crucial signaling integrator of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in NK cells. Moreover, we propose that boosting the metabolic activity of antitumor lymphocytes could be an effective strategy to promote immune-mediated tumor suppression.

Today, it is clear that anti-tumor functions of NK cells are tightly regulated and expand far beyond the simple killing of malignant cells. In spite of tremendous steps made in understanding the NK cell biology, further work is warranted to fully exploit the anticancer potential of these cells. Indeed, tumormediated immune suppression hampers NK cell activity, thus complicating their stimulation for therapeutic purposes.

As such, there is increasing interest in determining how wild animals adapt and respond to environmental stressors. The glucocorticoid (GC) stress response enables animals to react appropriately to environmental challenges but can be affected by many factors, two of which are habitat quality and time of year (i.e., season). This study tested whether baseline and maximum (stress-induced) whole-body cortisol concentrations varied in relation to habitat quality and season using wild central mudminnows (Umbra limi) collected from two connected streams differing in habitat quality in each of four seasons. Overall, baseline and maximum cortisol levels did not differ significantly between the two systems but there was evidence of a seasonal effect. Baseline cortisol levels in the fall and summer were significantly (P< 0.01) lower than those in winter and spring and maximum cortisol levels in the summer were significantly lower (P< 0.01) than those in the spring. Inconsistent with the prevailing paradigm, our results indicate that habitat quality does not always influence baseline GCs or the stress response.

However, despite the usefulness of MWCNTs in industry, their oxidative stress-induced toxicity, combined toxicity with metal, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation have not been widely investigated in marine organisms. We used the intertidal copepod Tigriopus japonicus as a test organism to demonstrate the adverse effects induced by MWCNTs in aquatic test organisms. The dispersion of the MWCNTs in seawater was maintained over 48. h without aggregation. MWCNTs caused a decrease in acute copper toxicity compared to the copper-only group in response to 20 and 100. mg/L MWCNTs, but not in response to 4. mg/L MWCNT, indicating that MWCNT may suppress acute copper toxicity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enzymatic activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase were significantly down-regulated in response to 100. mg/L MWCNT exposure. Glutathione (GSH) and glutathione reductase (GR) activity did not change significantly, indicating that MWCNTs may cause failure of the antioxidant system in T. japonicus. However, MWCNT induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation without p38 and c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, suggesting that ERK activation plays a key role in cell signaling pathways downstream of CNT exposure. This suggests that this pathway can be used as a biomarker for CNT exposure in T. japonicus.

Females laying blue eggs belong to an ancient (∼2.6 Myr) maternal lineage, as evidenced by both mitochondrial and W-linked DNA, but are indistinguishable at nuclear DNA from other common cuckoos. Hence, cuckoo host races with blue eggs are distinguished only by maternally inherited components of the genome, which maintain host-specific adaptation despite interbreeding among males and females reared by different hosts.

This study was designed to investigate the toxicity of triphenyltin chloride (TPTCl) on the rotifer Brachionus koreanus across different levels of biological organisation. Firstly, we concurrently performed a 24 h static-acute toxicity test and a 6-day semi-static multigenerational life-cycle test using the rotifer. Our results demonstrated that the 24-h median lethal concentration of TPTCl for the rotifer was 29.6 μg/L and the 6-day median effect concentration, based on the population growth inhibition, was 3.31 μg/L. Secondly, we examined the expression of 12 heat shock protein (hsp) genes, four glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes, one retinoid X receptor (RXR) gene and 13 cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes in the rotifers after exposure to 20 μg/L TPTCl for 24 h. Among these studied genes, hsp90α2, GST-O and CYP3045C1 were the most significantly up-regulated genes with a relative expression level up to 32.9, 4.4 and 62.6 folds, respectively. The expression of these three genes in the rotifers showed an increasing trend in the first few hours of TPTCl exposure, peaked at 3 h (hsp90α2 and GST-O) and 12 h (CYP3045C1) respectively, and then gradually returned to a lower level at 24 h. Such up-regulations of hsp and GST genes probably offer cellular protection against the TPT-mediated oxidative stress while the accelerated induction of CYP genes possibly facilitates the detoxification of this toxicant in the rotifer. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..","ACR; CYP; Gene expression; Population growth rate; Rotifer","Chlorine compounds; Detoxification; Gene expression; Genes; Marine biology; Marine pollution; Mines; Population statistics; Toxicity; ACR; Biological organization; CYP; Glutathione S-transferases; Median Lethal concentration; Population growth rates; Rotifer; Triphenyltin chloride; Gene expression regulation; cytochrome P450; cytochrome p450 5c1; glutathione transferase; heat shock protein; heat shock protein 90 alpha2; retinoid X receptor; triphenyltin chloride; unclassified drug; helminth protein; organotin compound; reactive oxygen metabolite; triphenyltin chloride; acute toxicity; Article; Brachionus; Brachionus koreanus; cell protection; chronic toxicity; controlled study; detoxification; diagnostic procedure; down regulation; EC50; growth inhibition; life cycle test; nonhuman; oxidative stress; plant gene; priority journal; protein expression; toxicity testing; upregulation; animal; chemistry; drug effects; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; Rotifera; Brachionus; Rotifera; Animals; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Gene Expression Regulation; Glutathione Transferase; Heat-Shock Proteins; Helminth Proteins; Organotin Compounds; Reactive Oxygen Species; Retinoid X Receptors; Rotifera; Toxicity Tests, Acute; Toxicity Tests, Chronic"

This complex behaviour enables animals to exploit many temporally productive and spatially discrete habitats to accrue various fitness benefits (e.g. growth, reproduction, predator avoidance). Human activities and global environmental change represent potential threats to migrating animals (from individuals to species), and research is underway to understand mechanisms that control migration and how migration responds to modern challenges. Focusing on behavioural and physiological aspects of migration can help to provide better understanding, management and conservation of migratory populations. Here, we highlight different physiological, behavioural and biomechanical aspects of animal migration that will help us to understand how migratory animals interact with current and future anthropogenic threats. We are in the early stages of a changing planet, and our understanding of how physiology is linked to the persistence of migratory animals is still developing; therefore, we regard the following questions as being central to the conservation physiology of animal migrations. Will climate change influence the energetic costs of migration? Will shifting temperatures change the annual clocks of migrating animals? Will anthropogenic influences have an effect on orientation during migration? Will increased anthropogenic alteration of migration stopover sites/migration corridors affect the stress physiology of migrating animals? Can physiological knowledge be used to identify strategies for facilitating the movement of animals? Our synthesis reveals that given the inherent challenges of migration, additional stressors derived from altered environments (e.g. climate change, physical habitat alteration, light pollution) or interaction with human infrastructure (e.g. wind or hydrokinetic turbines, dams) or activities (e.g. fisheries) could lead to long-term changes to migratory phenotypes. However, uncertainty remains because of the complexity of biological systems, the inherently dynamic nature of the environment and the scale at which many migrations occur and associated threats operate, necessitating improved integration of physiological approaches to the conservation of migratory animals. © The Author 2016.","Behaviour; Energetics; Human impacts; Mechanism; Movement",

Much of the uncertainty stems from the multi-faceted role of GCs in organismal metabolism, and their variable influence with respect to life-history stage, ecological context, age, sex and individual variation. Glucocorticoid hormones have been implicated in the regulation of parental care in many vertebrate taxa but in two seemingly contradictory ways, which sets up a potential GC-induced 'reproductive conflict'. Circulating GCs mediate adaptive physiological and behavioural responses to stressful events, and elevated levels can lead to trade offs between reproductive effort and survival (e.g. the current reproduction vs. survival hypothesis). The majority of studies examining the fitness effects of GC manipulations extend from this hypothesis. However, when animals are not stressed (likely most of the time) baseline GCs act as key metabolic regulators of daily energy balance, homoeostasis, osmoregulation and food acquisition, with pleiotropic effects on locomotor activity or foraging behaviour. Slight increases in circulating baseline levels can then have positive effects on reproductive effort (e.g. the 'cort' fitness/adaptation hypotheses), but comparatively few GC manipulation studies have targeted these small, non-stress induced increases. We review studies of GC manipulations and examine the specific hypotheses used to predict the effects of manipulations in wild, breeding vertebrates. We argue that given the dichotomous function of GCs the current 'reproduction vs. survival' paradigm is unnecessarily restrictive and predicts only deleterious GC effects on fitness. Therefore, a broader set of hypotheses should be considered when testing the fitness effects of GC manipulations. When framing experimental manipulation studies, we urge researchers to consider three key points: life-history context (e.g. long vs. short lived, semelparous vs. iteroparous, etc.), ecological context and dose delivery. © 2016 British Ecological Society.","Baseline levels; Corticosterone; Cortisol; Fitness; Glucocorticoids; Implants","Animalia; Vertebrata"

Here, we report that among PKC isoforms, PKCδ is strongly associated with infiltration of GBM cells. Notably, PKCδ enhanced Tyr418 phosphorylation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase SRC, which in turn activated STAT3 and subsequent NOTCH2 signaling, ultimately leading to GBM cell invasiveness. Furthermore, we showed that PKCδ was aberrantly activated in GBM cells by c-MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase hyperactivated in GBM. In agreement, inhibition either component in the c-MET/PKCδ/SRC/STAT3 signaling axis effectively blocked the NOTCH2 signaling and invasiveness of GBM cells.

It can promote the destruction of important cell populations and trigger dramatic tissue remodeling following establishment of chronic disease. Therefore, a better understanding of TNF regulation is needed to allow pathogen control without causing or exacerbating disease. IL-10 is an important regulatory cytokine with broad activities, including the suppression of inflammation. IL-10 is produced by different immune cells; however, its regulation and function appears to be cell-specific and context-dependent. Recently, IL-10 produced by Th1 (Tr1) cells was shown to protect host tissues from inflammation induced following infection. Here, we identify a novel pathway of TNF regulation by IL-10 from Tr1 cells during parasitic infection. We report elevated Blimp-1 mRNA levels in CD4+ T cells from visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients, and demonstrate IL-12 was essential for Blimp-1 expression and Tr1 cell development in experimental VL. Critically, we show Blimp-1-dependent IL-10 production by Tr1 cells prevents tissue damage caused by IFNγ-dependent TNF production. Therefore, we identify Blimp-1-dependent IL-10 produced by Tr1 cells as a key regulator of TNF-mediated pathology and identify Tr1 cells as potential therapeutic tools to control inflammation. © 2016 Montes de Oca et al.",,"B lymphocyte induced maturation protein 1; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; tumor necrosis factor; interleukin 10; PRDM1 protein, human; repressor protein; tumor necrosis factor; animal experiment; animal model; Article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell migration; cell signaling assay; cytokine production; DNA synthesis; female; flow cytometry; fluorescence microscopy; immune response; Leishmania donovani; mouse; nonhuman; Plasmodium chabaudi infection; protein expression; regulatory T lymphocyte; splenomegaly; tissue injury; visceral leishmaniasis; animal; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; disease model; human; immunology; inflammation; malaria; male; mutant mouse strain; pathology; regulatory T lymphocyte; Th1 cell; visceral leishmaniasis; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Inflammation; Interleukin-10; Leishmaniasis, Visceral; Malaria; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Mutant Strains; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Repressor Proteins; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; Th1 Cells; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"

Almost all of this work has been done in the context of evolutionary ecology, with few explicit attempts to apply repeatability and context dependency of trait variation toward understanding conservation-related issues. Here, we review work examining the degree to which repeatability of traits (such as boldness, swimming performance, metabolic rate and stress responsiveness) is context dependent. We review methods for quantifying repeatability (distinguishing between within-context and across-context repeatability) and confounding factors that may be especially problematic when attempting to measure repeatability in wild fish. Environmental factors such temperature, food availability, oxygen availability, hypercapnia, flow regime and pollutants all appear to alter trait repeatability in fishes. This suggests that anthropogenic environmental change could alter evolutionary trajectories by changing which individuals achieve the greatest fitness in a given set of conditions. Gaining a greater understanding of these effects will be crucial for our ability to forecast the effects of gradual environmental change, such as climate change and ocean acidification, the study of which is currently limited by our ability to examine trait changes over relatively short time scales. Also discussed are situations in which recent advances in technologies associated with electronic tags (biotelemetry and biologging) and respirometry will help to facilitate increased quantification of repeatability for physiological and integrative traits, which so far lag behind measures of repeatability of behavioural traits. © The Author 2016.","Environmental effects; Intraclass correlation; Personality; Phenotypic plasticity; Reaction norm; Temperature",

ConclusionA fish is chased with a net in an aquarium before being captured, scooped out of the water, and placed in a nearby testing arena. Is it stressed? How can we tell? Are our indicators reliable? Quantification of stress in fish has evolved from the initial development of radioimmunoassays to measure cortisol in plasma to the rapidly expanding suite of genome-based assays. Indicators range from the intracellular to whole-animal level. Expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and activity of metabolic enzymes can be paired with straightforward observations of reflexes and survival. Both traditional and emerging indicators have advantages and disadvantages, and their use is tissue- and context-specific. Ecological, biological, and methodological factors must be considered when selecting, measuring, and interpreting stress indicators. Inter- and intraspecific, sex, life stage, and temporal differences in physiological responses to stressors can confound confirmation of a stressed state. Despite numerous types of indicators, our understanding of how absolute levels of indicators relate to stressor severity and recovery to date remains limited. How accurately indicators characterize stress in wild populations naturally exposed to stressors is still an evolving discussion. The integration of research disciplines and involvement of stakeholders and user groups will aid in filling these knowledge gaps, as well as the translation of individual-level indicators to population- and ecosystem-level processes. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","behavior; bioenergetics; catecholamines; fitness; gene expression; glucocorticoids; Hypothalamic–pituitary–interrenal axis; reflex",

They are captured by directed commercial and recreational fisheries (the latter of which often promote catch and release) or as incidental catch or bycatch in commercial fisheries. Population assessments of pelagic fishes typically incorporate catch-per-unit-effort time-series data from commercial and recreational fisheries; however, there have been notable changes in target species, areas fished and depth-specific gear deployments over the years that may have affected catchability. Some regional fisheries management organizations take into account the effects of time- and area-specific changes in the behaviours of fish and fishers, as well as fishing gear, to standardize catch-per-unit-effort indices and refine population estimates. However, estimates of changes in stock size over time may be very sensitive to underlying assumptions of the effects of oceanographic conditions and prey distribution on the horizontal and vertical movement patterns and distribution of pelagic fishes. Effective management and successful conservation of pelagic fishes requires a mechanistic understanding of their physiological and behavioural responses to environmental variability, potential for interaction with commercial and recreational fishing gear, and the capture process. The interdisciplinary field of conservation physiology can provide insights into pelagic fish demography and ecology (including environmental relationships and interspecific interactions) by uniting the complementary expertise and skills of fish physiologists and fisheries scientists. The iterative testing by one discipline of hypotheses generated by the other can span the fundamental-applied science continuum, leading to the development of robust insights supporting informed management. The resulting species-specific understanding of physiological abilities and tolerances can help to improve stock assessments, develop effective bycatch-reduction strategies, predict rates of post-release mortality, and forecast the population effects of environmental change. In this synthesis, we review several examples of these interdisciplinary collaborations that currently benefit pelagic fisheries management. © The Author 2016.","Bycatch; Cardiorespiratory; Fry paradigm; Pelagic fishes; Post-release survival",

At the same time, however, there is a growing recognition of the degree of variation among individuals within a population, as well as the ecological consequences of this variation. Managing resources at an ecosystem level calls on practitioners to consider evolutionary processes, and ample evidence from the realm of fisheries science indicates that anthropogenic disturbance can drive changes in predominant character traits (e.g. size at maturity). Eco-evolutionary theory suggests that human-induced trait change and the modification of selective regimens might contribute to ecosystem dynamics at a similar magnitude to species extirpation, extinction and ecological dysfunction. Given the dynamic interaction between fisheries and target species via harvest and subsequent ecosystem consequences, we argue that individual diversity in genetic, physiological and behavioural traits are important considerations under EAFMs. Here, we examine the role of individual variation in a number of contexts relevant to fisheries management, including the potential ecological effects of rapid trait change. Using select examples, we highlight the extent of phenotypic diversity of individuals, as well as the ecological constraints on such diversity. We conclude that individual phenotypic diversity is a complex phenomenon that needs to be considered in EAFMs, with the ultimate realization that maintaining or increasing individual trait diversity may afford not only species, but also entire ecosystems, with enhanced resilience to environmental perturbations. Put simply, individuals are the foundation from which population- and ecosystem-level traits emerge and are therefore of central importance for the ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management. © The Author 2016.","Conservation behaviour; Ecosystem models; Ecosystem-based management; Fisheries management; Individual-based models; Individual-level variation",

We hypothesized that many suitable host species for brood parasites similarly seek refuge in the proximity of humans to avoid parasitism. In 2 study areas sized 50 km2 in Denmark and France that consist of half urban habitats and half rural habitats, more than 77% of all birds were located within a distance of 100 m from the nearest inhabited house. Consistent with our hypothesis we found that brood parasitic common cuckoos Cuculus canorus kept a longer mean distance from human habitation than did numerous potential host species that generally nest close to human habitation. Thus, parasitism rate increased with increasing distance from human habitation. In an intraspecific study of the Oriental reed warbler Acrocephalus orientalis, we showed that parasitism rate increased with distance from the nearest human habitation, and individuals of this species were disproportionately aggregated near human habitation. Because numerous bird species have evolved close proximity to humans, we hypothesize that avoidance of brood parasitism is an important selective force having contributed to this pattern of microgeographic distribution. © 2016 The Author.","birds; brood parasitism; distance to nearest house; humans; refuge","Acrocephalus; Acrocephalus orientalis; Aves; Cuculus canorus; Raptores"

We experimentally tested for spatial variation in foreign egg rejection in 395 nests across latitudinal gradients in China (5 populations) and Europe (7 populations). In China, egg rejection rates were very high but showed a latitudinal gradient from 100% in the south to 52% in the north.

While descriptions of the specific avenues in which conservation and physiology can be integrated are readily available and important to the continuing expansion of the discipline of 'conservation physiology', to date there has been no assessment of how the field has specifically contributed to conservation success. However, the goal of conservation physiology is to foster conservation solutions and it is therefore important to assess whether physiological approaches contribute to downstream conservation outcomes and management decisions. Here, we present eight areas of conservation concern, ranging from chemical contamination to invasive species to ecotourism, where physiological approaches have led to beneficial changes in human behaviour, management or policy. We also discuss the shared characteristics of these successes, identifying emerging themes in the discipline. Specifically, we conclude that conservation physiology: (i) goes beyond documenting change to provide solutions; (ii) offers a diversity of physiological metrics beyond glucocorticoids (stress hormones); (iii) includes approaches that are transferable among species, locations and times; (iv) simultaneously allows for human use and benefits to wildlife; and (v) is characterized by successes that can be difficult to find in the primary literature. Overall, we submit that the field of conservation physiology has a strong foundation of achievements characterized by a diversity of conservation issues, taxa, physiological traits, ecosystem types and spatial scales. We hope that these concrete successes will encourage the continued evolution and use of physiological tools within conservation-based research and management plans. © The Author 2016.","Conservation physiology; Ecotourism; Invasive species; Nutrition; Sensory ecology; Toxicology",

Previous studies showed that barn swallows Hirundo rustica could distinguish between common cuckoo Cuculus canorus and sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus in Denmark, but seemed unable to make this distinction in China. However, these previous studies did not investigate vocal responses in terms of alarm calls. We tested whether barn swallows, which are regular hosts of the common cuckoo in China, could distinguish between the common cuckoo and sparrowhawk in China. In Heilongjiang, in the presence of the cuckoo and, in Hainan, in its absence, we used dummies of common cuckoo, sparrowhawk, and Oriental turtle dove Streptopelia orientalis (neutral control) to induce and record alarm calls that were used to estimate response to playbacks. Barn swallows responded more strongly to playbacks of swallow hawk alarm calls than in response to swallow cuckoo or swallow dove alarm calls.

Cold shock events have caused large-scale fish mortalities, and sublethal impacts are also known to occur but are less well documented. We argue that cold shock will become an important selective force in climate change scenarios. There is a rich history of research on cold shock in the context of industrial cooling effluents and aquaculture, providing a foundation upon which to develop and extend future work on cold shock and climate change.

IL-17 has emerged as an important proinflammatory cytokine required for limiting growth of both extracellular and intracellular pathogens. However, there are conflicting reports on the exact roles for IL-17 during parasitic infections and limited knowledge about cellular sources and the immune pathways it modulates. We examined the role of IL-17 in an experimental model of VL caused by infection of C57BL/6 mice with L. donovani and identified an early suppressive role for IL-17 in the liver that limited control of parasite growth. IL-17-producing γδ T cells recruited to the liver in the first week of infection were the critical source of IL-17 in this model, and CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes were an important target for the suppressive effects of IL-17. Improved parasite control was independent of NO generation, but associated with maintenance of superoxide dismutase mRNA expression in the absence of IL-17 in the liver.

We conducted experiments to determine whether checkered pufferfish (Sphoeroides testudineus), which were collected from a dynamic (in terms of depth and water temperature) tidal mangrove creek environment in The Bahamas, have consistent individual-level differences in locomotor activity and the response to a simulated predator threat, as well as swimming performance and puffing in response to stressors. The relationships between personality and performance traits were evaluated to determine whether they represented stress-coping styles or syndromes. Subsequently, a displacement study was conducted to determine how personality and performance in the laboratory compared to movements in the field. In addition, we tested whether a physiological dose of the stress hormone cortisol would alter individual consistency in behavioural and performance traits. We found that pufferfish exhibited consistent individual differences in personality traits over time (e.g., activity and the duration of a response to a threat) and that performance was consistent between the lab and the natural enclosure. Locomotor activity and the duration of startled behaviour were not associated with swimming and puffing performance. Locomotor activity, puffing performance, and swimming performance were not related to whether fish returned to the tidal creek of capture after displacement. Similarly, a cortisol treatment did not modify behaviour or performance in the laboratory. The results reveal that consistent individual-level differences in behaviour and performance were present in a population from a fluctuating and physiologically challenging environment but that such traits are not necessarily correlated. We also determined that certain individual performance traits were repeatable between the lab and a natural enclosure. However, we found no evidence of a relationship between exogenous cortisol levels and behavioural traits or performance in these fish, which suggests that other internal and external mechanisms may underlie the behaviours and performance tested. © 2015.","Coping; Cortisol; Movement; Sphoeroides testudineus; Swimming performance","hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone; psychotropic agent; animal behavior; Article; controlled study; exhaustion; hydrocortisone blood level; locomotion; nonhuman; personality; physiological stress; predation; priority journal; puffer fish; startle reflex; stress; swimming; adaptive behavior; animal; animal housing; Bahamas; drug effects; environment; mental stress; motor activity; pathophysiology; personality; physiology; psychology; survival analysis; swimming; Tetraodontiformes; validation study; wild animal; Adaptation, Psychological; Animals; Animals, Wild; Bahamas; Environment; Housing, Animal; Hydrocortisone; Motor Activity; Personality; Psychotropic Drugs; Stress, Psychological; Survival Analysis; Swimming; Tetraodontiformes"

Herein we describe the identification of the Rb gene of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus japonicus. In silico analyses revealed the conserved Rb domains of T. japonicus with those of protostomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that orthologs of Rb gene were evolved by an ancient split event in deuterostomes, while only a single Rb gene was conserved in protostomes except for Drosophila. The transcription of the T. japonicus Rb gene continuously increased across the molting transition from nauplius to the copepodid and adult stages, suggesting that it may play a developmental role in the molting process of T. japonicus. Information on Rb's response to environmental stressors, including toxin exposure, is lacking in copepods. To examine the transcriptional response to stressful conditions in laboratory culture conditions, copepods were exposed to UV-B radiation and different concentrations of metals, environmental toxins, and biocides. Transcription of the T. japonicus Rb gene was upregulated in response to about half of the 96h-LD50 of UV-B radiation (12kJ/m2) for 48h, while the approximate 96h-LD50 value (24kJ/m2) of UV-B and relatively high concentrations of several toxins and biocides induced the downregulation of T. japonicus Rb mRNA expression.

Recently, several examples of nestling recognition and rejection by fosterers have been reported. Here, we tested for chick recognition ability in red-rumped swallows (Hirundo daurica), which build closed nests and do not discriminate against foreign eggs, by using cross-fostering experiments while controlling for responses to intraspecific and interspecific parasitism in closely related swallow species. We show that red-rumped swallows do not discriminate against conspecific or barn swallow (H. rustica) nestlings, but eject or reject cuckoo nestlings cross-fostered in red-rumped swallow nests by starving the introduced chicks to death. Assuming that the behavior of red-rumped swallows evolved in response to cuckoo parasitism, this study represents novel empirical evidence showing that chick discrimination evolved when brood parasites have completely evaded host defenses at the egg stage. The evolution of such recognition ability may be explained as a defense against avian brood parasitism by small-sized cuckoos or a pre-adaptation to specific communication between host parents and offspring. Our results are consistent with the “rarer enemy” hypothesis predicting that nestling discrimination should evolve only in hosts that accept all naturally laid parasite eggs and thus do not decrease effective parasitism rate at the nestling stage. In contrast, the findings were inconsistent with a number of alternative hypotheses. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cavity-nest; Cross-fostering; Food allocation; Hirundo daurica; Hirundo rustica; Nestling recognition","behavioral ecology; brood parasitism; conspecific; natural enemy; nestling; parent-offspring interaction; passerine; recognition; Aves; Cuculidae; Hirundinidae; Hirundo; Hirundo daurica; Hirundo rustica"

Stressors experienced during the fall may therefore influence their propensity to migrate as well as carry over into the winter resulting in mortality when fish face challenging environmental conditions. To evaluate this possibility, we artificially elevated cortisol levels in juvenile trout (via intracoelomic injection of cortisol in the fall) and used passive integrated transponder tags to compare their overwinter and spring survival, growth, and migration success relative to a control group. Results suggest that overwinter mortality is high for individuals in this population regardless of treatment. However, survival rates were 2.5 times lower for cortisol-treated fish and they experienced significantly greater loss in mass. In addition, less than half as many cortisol-treated individuals made it downstream to a stationary antenna over the winter and also during the spring migration compared to the control treatment. These results suggest that a fall stressor can reduce overwinter survival of juvenile brown trout, negatively impact growth of individuals that survive, and ultimately result in a reduction in the number of migratory trout. Carryover effects such as those documented here reveal the cryptic manner in which natural and anthropogenic stressors can influence fish populations. J. Exp.

Large nests may signal the parenting ability of nest builders suggesting that nests may have a signaling function. In particular, many raptors build very large nests for their body size. We studied nest size in the goshawk Accipiter gentilis, which is a top predator throughout most of the Nearctic. Both males and females build nests, and males provision their females and offspring with food. Nest volume in the goshawk is almost three-fold larger than predicted from their body size. Nest size in the goshawk is highly variable and may reach more than 600 kg for a bird that weighs ca. 1 kg. While 8.5 % of nests fell down, smaller nests fell down more often than large nests. There was a hump-shaped relationship between nest volume and female age, with a decline in nest volume late in life, as expected for senescence. Clutch size increased with nest volume. Nest volume increased during 1977–2014 in an accelerating fashion, linked to increasing spring temperature during April, when goshawks build and start reproduction. These findings are consistent with nest size being a reliable signal of parental ability, with large nest size signaling superior parenting ability and senescence, and also indicating climate warming. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Accipiter gentilis; Climate change; Extended phenotype; Goshawk; Senescence; Signal","body size; climate change; clutch size; life history; Nearctic Ecozone; nest structure; phenotype; predator; raptor; senescence; signal; weight; Accipiter gentilis; Animalia; Aves; Raptores; anatomy and histology; animal; bird; body size; climate change; clutch size; Falconiformes; female; male; nesting; physiology; raptor; reproduction; season; temperature; Animals; Birds; Body Size; Climate Change; Clutch Size; Falconiformes; Female; Male; Nesting Behavior; Raptors; Reproduction; Seasons; Temperature"

It is becoming clear that ecological carryover effects are a common phenomenon across taxa, and have the potential to play an important role in governing individual fitness and population dynamics. Carryover effects may reduce the success of conservation efforts aimed at slowing or reversing biodiversity loss. Failure to consider carryover effects might lead to erroneous conclusions about the effectiveness of conservation measures. We suggest that carryover effects are considered explicitly in threat assessment and conservation planning, in order to understand the long-term consequences of stressors, target efforts more effectively, and ensure that the success or failure of conservation efforts is tracked more accurately. We encourage proactive research focused on the proximate mechanisms underlying carryover effects, so that predictive measures of carryover effects in wild populations can be developed and refined. Finally, we suggest that in some cases, positive carryover effects could be exploited for conservation benefit.

However, its molecular mechanisms underlying radiation-induced cancer progression remain obscure. Here, we report that exposure to fractionated radiation (2 Gy per day for 3 days) induces the secretion of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that has been commonly used in cancer therapies to ameliorate neutropenia. Intriguingly, radiation-induced G-CSF promoted the migratory and invasive properties by triggering the epithelial-mesenchymal cell transition (EMT) in non-small-cell lung cancer cells (NSCLCs). By irradiation, G-CSF was upregulated transcriptionally by β-catenin/TCF4 complex that binds to the promoter region of G-CSF as a transcription factor. Importantly, irradiation increased the stability of β-catenin through the activation of PI3K/AKT (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT), thereby upregulating the expression of G-CSF. Radiation-induced G-CSF is recognized by G-CSFR and transduced its intracellular signaling JAK/STAT3 (Janus kinase/ signal transducers and activators of transcription ), thereby triggering EMT program in NSCLCs. Taken together, our findings suggest that the application of G-CSF in cancer therapies to ameliorate neutropenia should be reconsidered owing to its effect on cancer progression, and G-CSF could be a novel therapeutic target to mitigate the harmful effect of radiotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; beta catenin; cycloheximide; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; Janus kinase; messenger RNA; nerve cell adhesion molecule; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; small interfering RNA; STAT3 protein; vimentin; beta catenin; CTNNB1 protein, human; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; JAK1 protein, human; Janus kinase 1; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; STAT3 protein; STAT3 protein, human; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell growth; cell migration; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; down regulation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; fluorescence activated cell sorting; genetic transfection; histopathology; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; intracellular signaling; irradiation; lung cancer cell line; mouse; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; protein secretion; quantitative analysis; radiation exposure; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; upregulation; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Lung Neoplasms; pathology; physiology; radiation dose fractionation; radiation response; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; beta Catenin; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Dose Fractionation; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor; Humans; Janus Kinase 1; Lung Neoplasms; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; STAT3 Transcription Factor"

Sex, size, and diel periods had no effect on thermal occupancy of adult walleye in either lake. Thermal occupancy differed between lakes and seasons. Walleye from Lake Erie generally experienced higher temperatures throughout the spring and summer months than did walleye in Lake Huron, due to limnological differences between the lakes. Tagged walleye that remained in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron (i.e., adjacent to the release location), as opposed to those migrating to the main basin of Lake Huron, experienced higher temperatures, and thus accumulated more thermal units (the amount of temperature units amassed over time) throughout the year. Walleye that migrated toward the southern end of Lake Huron occupied higher temperatures than those that moved toward the north. Consequently, walleye that emigrated from Saginaw Bay experienced thermal environments that were more favorable for growth as they spent more time within their thermal optimas than those that remained in Saginaw Bay.

This suggests that inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling, but not classic signaling, might suppress allergic airway inflammation. Objectives We sought to determine whether IL-6 signaling contributes to (1) acute experimental asthma induced by clinically relevant allergens and (2) variation in asthma clinical phenotypes in asthmatic patients. Methods Mice were sensitized to house dust mite (HDM) or cockroach at day 0, treated with IL-6R inhibitors at day 13, and challenged with the same allergen at days 14 to 17. End points were measured 3 hours after the final challenge. IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) expression in induced sputum of asthmatic patients was correlated with asthma clinical phenotypes. Results Both HDM and cockroach induced a type 2/type 17 cytokine profile and mixed granulocytic inflammation in the airways. Both allergens increased IL-6 expression in the airways, but only cockroach induced sIL-6R expression. Therefore HDM challenge promoted IL-6 classic signaling but not trans-signaling; in this model treatment with anti-IL-6R did not suppress airway inflammation. In contrast, cockroach-induced inflammation involved activation of IL-6 trans-signaling and production of IL-17A by γδ T cells. Anti-IL-6R, selective blockade of sIL-6R, or γδ T-cell deficiency significantly attenuated cockroach-induced inflammation. Asthmatic patients with high airway IL-6 and sIL-6R levels were enriched for the neutrophilic and mixed granulocytic subtypes. Conclusion Experimental asthma associated with both high IL-6 and high sIL-6R levels in the airways is attenuated by treatment with IL-6R inhibitors. © 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","allergy; endotype; eosinophils; IL-17; MR16-1; neutrophils; sgp130-Fc; Tocilizumab; γδ T cell","house dust allergen; interleukin 17; interleukin 6; interleukin 6 receptor; allergen; interleukin 6; interleukin 6 receptor; lymphocyte antigen receptor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cockroach; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine response; Dermatophagoides; experimental asthma; gamma delta T lymphocyte; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; Th17 cell; Th2 cell; animal; asthma; chemically induced; drug effects; immunology; pathology; Pyroglyphidae; signal transduction; Th17 cell; Th2 cell; Allergens; Animals; Asthma; Cockroaches; Interleukin-6; Mice; Pyroglyphidae; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta; Receptors, Interleukin-6; Signal Transduction; Th17 Cells; Th2 Cells"

Although a large gene family expansion of LITAF homologues was observed in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the amino acid sequences encoded by the C. elegans LITAF homologue have low similarities to other LITAF gene family members. In this study, three LITAF genes were identified in the monogonont rotifer Brachionus koreanus. In silico analyses of B. koreanus LITAF genes of conserved domains and phylogenetic relationships supported gene annotations that indicated that LITAF is involved in innate immunity in primitive rotifers. To examine transcriptional sensitivity of B. koreanus LITAF genes, the rotifers were exposed to different concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Transcriptional levels of LITAF1 and LITAF2 gene were significantly upregulated dose- and time-dependently in response to LPS exposure for 24. h.

In these birds, the degree of fatty acid unsaturation is positively related to maximum lifespan across species. This is due to a positive effect of monounsaturated fatty acid content, while polyunsaturated fatty acid content negatively correlates with maximum lifespan. Furthermore, fatty acid chain length unsuspectedly increases with maximum lifespan independently of degree of unsaturation. These findings tune theories on the proximate causes of ageing while providing evidence that the evolution of lifespan in birds occurs in association with fatty acid profiles.

Hawksbill Creek, which potentially served as a natural migration route for fish from the north side to the south side of the island, was severed and replaced by a man-made canal called the Grand Lucayan Waterway (GLW). Bonefish (Albula spp.), a sport-fish that contributes more than $141 million to the Bahamian economy annually, is one such species that may have been affected. The purpose of this study was to determine contemporary movement corridors of adult bonefish during their spawning season (October to May) in Grand Bahamian waters. This was accomplished by using a passive acoustic telemetry array of 17 receivers and 30 transmitter-implanted individuals. A total of 26,108 detections were logged from 20 of the fish. Eight bonefish tagged on the north side used the GLW to access waters on the south, whereas no transmitter-implanted fish tagged on the south side fully traversed the man-made canal, suggesting that primary spawning areas may be located on the south side of the island. This result is consistent with previous reports that bonefish spawn near deep water which is easier to access on the south side of Grand Bahama. Further supporting this finding, two other bonefish tagged on the north side forayed around the east end of the island and were detected on receivers approximately 88 km from their tagging locations. Additionally, two other bonefish tagged on the north side were detected at the west end of the island, with one individual continuing its movements along the south side of the island for an approximate straight-line distance of 80 km. Canal use typically corresponded to days immediately prior to or after new or full moons, indicating that movements were related to spawning. This study suggests that despite historical habitat modifications, bonefish today use the GLW as a movement corridor for migrations during spawning season, emphasizing the importance of protecting the canal from any activities that could impede connectivity. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Acoustic telemetry; Bonefish; Pre-spawning aggregations","adult; aggregation behavior; archipelago; canal; deep water; island biogeography; migration route; movement; spawning; telemetry; teleost; Bahamas; Grand Bahama; Albula; Albula vulpes; Albulidae; Eretmochelys imbricata"

Using the ecologically and economically important sportfish, bonefish (Albula vulpes), we determined the critical swimming speed (Ucrit), metabolic rates (Formula presented.), scope for activity, and cost of transport (COTnet) across a range of temperatures using a swim tunnel. For both critical swimming speed and scope for activity, optimal (Topt) and critical (Tcrit) temperatures were determined. The optimal temperature for Ucrit (96 cm/s) was 28.0 °C and the optimal temperature for scope for activity (7.5 mgO2/min/kg) was 26.7 °C. We also estimated the thermal profile of bonefish in the wild using surgically implanted thermal loggers. Of the 138 implanted fish, eight were recaptured with functional loggers. After 220 days more than 55 % of recaptured tagged fish had expelled their thermal loggers. Thermal profiles revealed that bonefish did not exceed laboratory-determined critical temperatures (i.e., 14.5 °C minima and 37.9 °C maxima) and spent the majority of their time at their critical swimming speed optimal temperature. Nonetheless, fish experienced wide variation in daily temperature—both through time (up to 8 °C diel fluctuation and 14 °C seasonally) and among individuals. Collectively, laboratory and field data suggest that bonefish occupy habitats that approach, but rarely exceed (0.51 % of the time) their Tcrit. Bonefish routinely experienced water temperatures in the field that exceeded their Topt (~54 % of the time).

Acceleration measurements indicated that muskellunge tended to remain inactive for much of the time.

Activity also declined above temperatures of 25 °C and was lower for larger muskellunge.

The socio-economic benefits of recreational fisheries are numerous and substantial. Recreational fisheries through their practices (e.g. overharvest, habitat change, release mortality, stocking and dispersal of non-native fishes), however, have been implicated in negative effects on populations and ecosystems. In inland waters, fish populations also face a variety of threats that are external to the recreational fisheries sector such that recreational fisheries often operate on top of already imperilled resources. This chapter characterizes the scope and magnitude of inland recreational fisheries globally, explores recreational fisheries as a coupled social-ecological system, reviews management strategies, identifies the main issues faced by inland recreational fisheries and discusses the future of recreational fishing in inland waters with an emphasis on research and information needs to ensure their long-term sustainability. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Although field surveys can correlate abundance to habitat variables (physiochemical, biotic, and structural), they cannot provide mechanistic explanations. Moreover, field surveys are often stratified by time or geographic criteria relevant to humans, whereas fishes stratify by habitat variables relevant to them. If mechanisms underlying behavior are not explicitly understood, conclusions based on survey data can lead to biased inferences as to species-specific habitat requirements and preferences, as well as changes in stock size occurring over time. Because physiology is the transfer function that links specific environmental conditions to behavior and fitness, we argue great gains can be made through the integration of physiology and fisheries science. These are complementary disciplines, albeit ones that generally function at very different temporal and spatial scales, as well as different levels of biological organization. We argue more specifically that integrating physiological approaches with behavioral studies and traditional fisheries survey data (where each approach develops hypotheses to be tested in the other) can mechanistically link processes from cells through populations to place fisheries management in an appropriate ecosystem context. We further contend that population- and species-specific mechanistic understanding of physiological abilities and tolerances can significantly help to: improve stock assessments, describe essential fish habitat, predict rates of post-release mortality, develop effective bycatch reduction strategies, and forecast the population effects of increases in global temperatures and ocean acidification. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Aquaculture; Bycatch; Climate change; Ecology; Fisheries; Fry’s paradigm; Physiology; Post-release survival","abundance; behavioral response; bycatch; climate change; fish; physiological response; population structure; survival; Pisces"

Inherent challenges faced by fish during winter may be compounded by additional stressors that activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis, either before or during winter, leading to negative sub-lethal impacts on fish health and condition, and possibly reducing chance of survival. We used experimental cortisol manipulation to test the hypothesis that juvenile largemouth bass (. Micropterus salmoides) exposed to semi-chronic elevation in cortisol prior to winter would experience higher levels of over-winter mortality, physiological alterations and impaired immune status relative to control and sham-treated bass. Over-winter survival in experimental ponds was high, averaging 83%, and did not differ among treatment groups. Over the study period, bass exhibited an average increase in mass of 19.4%, as well as a slight increase in Fulton's condition factor, but neither measure differed among groups. Hepatosomatic index in cortisol-treated bass was 23% lower than in control fish, suggesting lower energy status, but white muscle lipid content was similar across all groups. Lastly, there was no difference in spleen somatic index or parasite load among treatment groups, indicating no long-term immune impairment related to our cortisol manipulation. The current study adds to a growing body of literature on glucocorticoid manipulations where field-based findings are not consistent with laboratory-based conceptual understanding of multiple stressors. This suggests that field conditions may provide fish with opportunities to mitigate negative effects of some stressors. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Carryover effects; Glucocorticoid manipulation; Hepatosomatic index; Juvenile centrarchids; Micropterus salmoides","hydrocortisone; lipid; hydrocortisone; air temperature; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; fast muscle; immune status; largemouth bass; nonhuman; parasite load; spleen; stress; survival; water content; winter; animal; bass; physiological stress; physiology; season; survival rate; Centrarchidae; Micropterus; Micropterus salmoides; Animals; Bass; Hydrocortisone; Seasons; Stress, Physiological; Survival Rate"

Here we experimentally show that two common recreational angling techniques (active crank baits versus passive soft plastics) differentially target wild largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) based on variation in their behavioural tendencies. Fish were first angled in the wild using both techniques and then brought back to the laboratory and tested for individual-level differences in common estimates of personality (refuge emergence, flightinitiation-distance, latency-to-recapture and with a net, and general activity) in an in-lake experimental arena. We found that different angling techniques appear to selectively target these species based on their boldness (as characterized by refuge emergence, a standard measure of boldness in fishes) but not other assays of personality. We also observed that body size was independently a significant predictor of personality in both species, though this varied between traits and species. Our results suggest a context-dependency for vulnerability to capture relative to behaviour in these fish species.

However, their toxic effects on marine organisms are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of BDE-47 and PFOS on development and reproduction at the organismal level and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and gene expression patterns of the defensome at the cellular level in the intertidal copepod Tigriopus japonicus. In copepods exposed to BDE-47 and PFOS, we observed developmental retardation and reduced fecundity, suggesting repercussions on in vivo endpoints through alterations to the normal molting and reproduction system of T. japonicus. BDE-47 and PFOS increased levels of ROS in T. japonicus in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that POPs can induce oxidative stress through the generation of ROS. Additionally, transcript profiles of genes related to detoxification (. e.g., CYPs), antioxidant functions (. e.g., GST- sigma, catalase, MnSOD), apoptosis (. e.g., p53, Rb), and cellular proliferation (. e.g., PCNA) were modulated over 72. h in response to BDE-47 (120. μg/L) and PFOS (1000. μg/L).

After UV radiation, we measured the re-brooding success, growth pattern of newly hatched nauplii, ingestion rate, and assimilation of diet. In addition, we checked the modulated patterns of DNA repair and heat shock protein (hsp) chaperoning genes of P. nana. UV-B radiation induced a significant reduction (7-87%) of the re-brooding rate of ovigerous females, indicating that UV-induced egg sac damage is closely correlated with a reduction in the hatching rate of UV-irradiated ovigerous female offspring. Using chlorophyll a and stable carbon isotope incubation experiments, we found a dose-dependent decrease (P<0.05) in food ingestion and the rate of assimilation to the body in response to UV radiation, implying that P. nana has an underlying ability to shift its balanced-energy status from growth and reproduction to DNA repair and adaptation. Also, expression of P. nana base excision repair (BER)-associated genes and hsp chaperoning genes was significantly increased in response to UV radiation in P. nana.

We test this hypothesis by relating the probability of establishment by birds on oceanic islands to the difference in breeding population density between urban and nearby rural habitats as a measure of urbanization in the ancestral range. This measure was the single-most important predictor of establishment success and the only statistically significant one, with additional effects of sexual dichromatism, number of releases and release effort, showing that the ability to cope with human proximity is a central component of successful establishment. Because most invasions occur as a consequence of human-assisted establishment, the ability to cope with human proximity will often be of central importance for successful establishment. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Birds; Distance to humans; Human proximity; Human transport; Invasion; Oceanic islands","bird; breeding population; home range; human activity; hypothesis testing; innovation; invasibility; population density; sexual behavior; urbanization; Animalia; Aves; animal; bird; city; ecosystem; environment; female; human; introduced species; island (geological); male; population density; rural population; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; urban population; urbanization; Animals; Birds; Cities; Ecosystem; Environment; Female; Humans; Introduced Species; Islands; Male; Models, Statistical; Population Density; Rural Population; Urban Population; Urbanization"

Prey will initiate flight soon after detecting a predator so as to minimize attentional costs related to on-going monitoring of the whereabouts of the predator. Such costs may compete with foraging and other maintenance activities and hence be larger than the costs of immediate flight. The drivers of interspecific variation in escape strategy are poorly known. Here we investigated the morphological, life history and natural history traits that correlate with variation in avian escape strategy across a sample of 96 species of birds. Brain mass, body size, habitat structure and group size were the main predictors of escape strategy. The direction of the effect of these traits was consistent with selection for a reduction of monitoring costs. Therefore, attentional costs depend on relative brain size, which determines the ability to monitor the whereabouts of potential predators and the difficulty of this task as reflected by habitat and social complexity. Thus brain size, and the cognitive functions associated with it, constitute a general framework for explaining the effects of body size, habitat structure and sociality identified as determinants of avian escape strategy.",,"anatomy and histology; animal; bird; brain; escape behavior; female; male; organ size; physiology; predation; species difference; Animals; Birds; Brain; Escape Reaction; Female; Male; Organ Size; Predatory Behavior; Species Specificity"

To annotate the 46 Pn-CYP genes, a phylogenetic analysis of CYP genes was performed using a Bayesian method. Pn-CYP genes were separated into five different clans: CYP2, CYP3, CYP20, CYP26, and mitochondrial. Among these, the principal Pn-CYP genes involved in detoxification were identified by comparing them with those of the copepod Tigriopus japonicus and were examined with respect to their responses to exposure to a water-accommodated fraction (WAF) of crude oil and to the alkylated forms of two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; phenanthrene and fluorene). The expression of two Pn-CYP3027 genes (CYP3027F1 and CYP3027F2) was increased in response to WAF exposure and also was upregulated in response to the two alkylated PAHs. In particular, Pn-CYP3027F2 showed the most notable increase in response to 80% WAF exposure. These two responsive CYP genes (Pn-CYP3027F1 and CYP3027F2) were also phylogenetically clustered into the same clade of the WAF- and alkylated PAH-specific CYP genes of the copepod T. japonicus, suggesting that these CYP genes would be those chiefly involved in detoxification in response to WAF exposure in copepods. In this paper, we provide information on the copepod P. nana CYP gene superfamily and also speculate on its potential role in the detoxification of PAHs in marine copepods. Despite the nonlethality of WAF, Pn-CYP3027F2 was rapidly and significantly upregulated in response to WAF that may serve as a useful biomarker of 40% or higher concentration of WAF exposure.

The signals that prime NK cells are not completely understood, and, although the importance of IFN type I is well recognized, the role of type III IFN is comparatively very poorly studied. IL-28R-deficient mice were resistant to LPS and cecal ligation puncture-induced septic shock, and hallmark cytokines in these disease models were dysregulated in the absence of IL-28R. IL-28R-deficient mice were more sensitive to experimental tumor metastasis and carcinogen-induced tumor formation than WT mice, and additional blockade of interferon alpha/beta receptor 1 (IFNAR1), but not IFN-γ, further enhanced metastasis and tumor development. IL-28R-deficient mice were also more susceptible to growth of the NK cell-sensitive lymphoma, RMAs. Specific loss of IL-28R in NK cells transferred into lymphocyte-deficient mice resulted in reduced LPS-induced IFN-γ levels and enhanced tumor metastasis. Therefore, by using IL-28R - deficient mice, which are unable to signal type III IFN-λ, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, the ability of IFN-λ to directly regulate NK cell effector functions in vivo, alone and in the context of IFN-αβ. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

This study examined the effects of water temperature and the duration of net entanglement on physiological disturbance and recovery in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) after release from a simulated beach seine capture. Heart rate was monitored using implanted electrocardiogram biologgers that allowed fish to swim freely before and after release. A subset of fish was recovered in respirometers to monitor metabolic recovery, and separate groups of fish were sacrificed at different times to assess blood and white muscle biochemistry. One hour after release, fish had elevated lactate in muscle and blood plasma, depleted tissue energy stores, and altered osmoregulatory status, particularly in warmer (15 vs. 10° C) and longer (15 vs. 2 min) capture treatments. A significant effect of entanglement duration on blood and muscle metabolites remained after 4 h. Oxygen consumption rate recovered to baseline within 7-10 h. However, recovery of heart rate to routine levels was longer and more variable, with most fish taking over 10 h, and 33% of fish failing to recover within 24 h. There were no significant treatment effects on either oxygen consumption or heart rate recovery. Our results indicate that fishers should minimize handling time for bycatch and maximize oxygen supply during crowding, especially when temperatures are elevated. Physiological data, such as those presented here, can be used to understand mechanisms that underlie bycatch impairment and mortality, and thus inform best practices that ensure the welfare and conservation of affected species. © 2015 Raby et al.

Few studies however have investigated its consequences for the local biota. We tested whether exposure of barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) nestlings to low dose ionizing radiation increased genetic damage to their peripheral erythrocytes. We estimated external radiation exposure by using thermoluminescent dosimeters, and by measuring radioactivity of the nest material. We then assessed DNA damage by means of the neutral comet assay. In addition, we conducted standard point-count censuses of barn swallows across environmental radiation levels, and estimated their abundance and local age ratio. Radioactivity of nest samples was in the range 479-143,349 Bq kg-1, while external exposure varied between 0.15 and 4.9 mGy. Exposure to radioactive contamination did not correlate with higher genetic damage in nestlings. However, at higher levels of radioactive contamination the number of barn swallows declined and the fraction of juveniles decreased, indicating lower survival and lower reproduction and/or fledging rate. Thus, genetic damage to nestlings does not explain the decline of barn swallows in contaminated areas, and a proximate mechanism for the demographic effects documented here remains to be clarified.",,"adverse effects; animal; DNA damage; Fukushima nuclear accident; genetics; radiation exposure; radiation monitoring; radiation response; swallow (bird); Animals; DNA Damage; Fukushima Nuclear Accident; Radiation Exposure; Radiation Monitoring; Swallows"

Here, we evaluate the relationship between the endocrine stress response and anti-predator behaviors in wild checkered puffers (. Sphoeroides testudineus) captured at Eleuthera Island, Bahamas. The checkered puffer has a unique and easily measurable predator avoidance strategy, which is to inflate or 'puff' to deter potential predators. In this study, we measured baseline and stress-induced circulating glucocorticoid levels, as well as bite force, a performance measure that is relevant to both feeding and predator defence, and 'puff' performance. We found that puff performance and bite force were consistent within individuals, but generally decreased following a standardized stressor. Larger puffers were able to generate a higher bite force, and larger puffers were able to maintain a more robust puff performance following a standardized stressor relative to smaller puffers. In terms of the relationship between the glucocorticoid stress response and performance metrics, we found no relationship between post-stress glucocorticoid levels and either puff performance or bite force. However, we did find that baseline glucocorticoid levels predicted the ability of a puffer to maintain a robust puff response following a repeated stressor, and this relationship was more pronounced in larger individuals. Our work provides a novel example of how baseline glucocorticoids can predict a fitness-related anti-predator behavior. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Bite force; Cort-fitness; Corticosterone; Cortisol; Stress; Teleost","glucocorticoid; glucose; hydrocortisone; animal behavior; animal cell; Article; Bahamas; body mass; body size; controlled study; defensive behavior; feeding behavior; glucose blood level; mastication; nonhuman; predator avoidance; priority journal; puffer fish; stress; animal; metabolism; physiological stress; physiology; predation; Tetraodontiformes; Animals; Bite Force; Hydrocortisone; Predatory Behavior; Stress, Physiological; Tetraodontiformes"

Whether cuckoos parasitize their hosts by laying eggs randomly or matching the egg morphs of their hosts is one of the mysteries of the cuckoo problem. Scientists tend to believe that cuckoos lay eggs matching the appearance of host eggs due to selection caused by the ability of the hosts to recognize their own eggs. In this paper, we first review previous empirical studies to test this mystery and found no studies have provided direct evidence of cuckoos choosing to parasitize host nests where egg color and pattern match. We then present examples of unmatched cuckoo eggs in host nests and key life history traits of cuckoos, e.g. secretive behavior and rapid egg-laying and link them to cuckoo egg laying behavior. Finally we develop a conceptual model to demonstrate the egg laying behaviour of cuckoos and propose an empirical test that can provide direct evidence of the egg-laying properties of female cuckoos. We speculate that the degree of egg matching between cuckoo eggs and those of the host as detected by humans is caused by the ability of the hosts to recognize their own eggs, rather than the selection of matching host eggs by cuckoos. The case of Common Cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) and their parrotbill hosts (Paradoxornis alphonsianus), where it has been shown that both have evolved polymorphic eggs (mainly blue and white), was used to develop a conceptual model to demonstrate why cuckoos should utilize parrotbill hosts by laying eggs randomly rather than laying eggs matching the appearance of host eggs. In conclusion, we found no evidence for the hypothesis that cuckoos lay eggs based on own egg color matching that of the parrotbill-cuckoo system. We argue theoretically that laying eggs matching those of the hosts in this system violates a key trait of the life history of cuckoos and therefore should be maladaptive. © 2015 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Common cuckoo; Egg color; Egg laying behavior; Egg polymorphy; Host imprint; Host selection",

As a result, managing invasive species is a priority for many conservation scientists and natural resource managers. Invasive species management requires a multidisciplinary approach and there is increasing recognition that physiology can be used to inform conservation efforts because physiological processes underlie an individual’s response to its environment. For example, physiological concepts and tools can be used to assess the impacts of invasive animals on their new ecosystems, to predict which animal species are likely to become invasive, to prevent the introduction of nonnative animals, and to control incipient or established invasions. To evaluate whether physiology is integrated within invasion science, the journal Biological Invasions was surveyed for a quantitative literature review. To determine how physiology is used to inform invasion science and which subdisciplines of physiology are particularly relevant to invasive animal management, the broader invasion literature was also reviewed to identify examples where physiology has contributed to studying and managing invasive animals. Only 6 % of articles published in Biological Invasions incorporated physiological knowledge or tools, mostly for the purposes of identifying traits associated with species invasiveness (i.e. prediction). However, the broader literature indicated that successful invasive species research and management can be supported by fundamental and applied physiological research for assessing, predicting, preventing, and controlling invasive animals. Development of new techniques and increased availability of equipment for remote or rapid monitoring of physiology in the field will increase opportunities for integrating physiology within invasion science. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Conservation physiology; Invasion management; Invasive Species; Macrophysiology","biodiversity; conservation planning; ecological impact; ecosystem management; invasive species; invasiveness; knowledge; literature review; nature conservation; physiological response; research work; Animalia"

OBJECTIVES:: We investigated the roles of bystander T, B, and NK cells; NKT cell-derived interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-21 cytokines; and NKT cell-derived perforin and granzyme B cytotoxins in promoting CD4+ NKT cell atherogenicity. METHODS AND RESULTS:: Transfer of CD4+ NKT cells into T-and B-cell-deficient ApoERag2 mice augmented aortic root atherosclerosis by ≈75% that was ≈30% of lesions in ApoE mice; macrophage accumulation similarly increased. Transferred NKT cells were identified in the liver and atherosclerotic lesions of recipient mice. Transfer of CD4+ NKT cells into T-, B-cell-deficient, and NK cell-deficient ApoERag2γC mice also augmented atherosclerosis. These data indicate that CD4+ NKT cells can exert proatherogenic effects independent of other lymphocytes. To investigate the role of NKT cell-derived interferon-γ, IL-4, and IL-21 cytokines and perforin and granzyme B cytotoxins, CD4+ NKT cells from mice deficient in these molecules were transferred into NKT cell-deficient ApoEJα18 mice. CD4+ NKT cells deficient in IL-4, interferon-γ, or IL-21 augmented atherosclerosis in ApoEJα18 mice by ≈95%, ≈80%, and ≈70%, respectively. Transfer of CD4+ NKT cells deficient in perforin or granzyme B failed to augment atherosclerosis. Apoptotic cells, necrotic cores, and proinflammatory VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule) and MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein) were reduced in mice receiving perforin-deficient NKT cells.

However, the extent of the contribution of biological sensors (within electronic tags) that measure an animal's state (e.g., heart rate, body temperature, and details of locomotion and energetics) is less clear. A literature review revealed that, despite a growing number of commercially available state sensor tags and enormous application potential for such devices in animal biology, there are relatively few examples of their application to conservation. Existing applications fell under 4 main themes: quantifying disturbance (e.g., ecotourism, vehicular and aircraft traffic), examining the effects of environmental change (e.g., climate change), understanding the consequences of habitat use and selection, and estimating energy expenditure. We also identified several other ways in which sensor tags could benefit conservation, such as determining the potential efficacy of management interventions. With increasing sensor diversity of commercially available platforms, less invasive attachment techniques, smaller device sizes, and more researchers embracing such technology, we suggest that biological sensor tags be considered a part of the necessary toolbox for conservation.

However, given that temperature changes will not occur in isolation of other stressors, it is necessary to explore the potential consequences of stress on the thermal tolerances and preferences of tropical marine fish in order to understand the thresholds for survival, and predict the associated coastal ecological consequences. In this study, we used exogenous cortisol injections to investigate the effects of a thermal challenge on checkered puffers (. Sphoeroides testudineus) as a secondary stressor. There were no significant differences between control and cortisol-treated fish 48. h following cortisol treatment for swimming ability (using a chase to exhaustion protocol), blood glucose concentrations or standard metabolic rate. In the lab, control and cortisol-treated puffers were exposed to ambient (29.1±1.5. °C), ambient +5. °C (heat shock) and ambient -5. °C (cold shock) for 4. h and to evaluate the consequences of abrupt temperature change on puff performance and blood physiology. Following cold shock, control fish exhibited increases in cortisol levels and weak 'puff' performance. Conversely, fish dosed with cortisol exhibited consistently high cortisol levels independent of thermal treatment, although there was a trend for an attenuated cortisol response in the cortisol-treated fish to the cold shock treatment. A 20-day complementary field study conducted in the puffer's natural habitat, a tidal creek in Eleuthera, The Bahamas, revealed that cortisol-injected fish selected significantly cooler temperatures, measured using accumulated thermal units, when compared to controls.

However, biomarker responses have limitation due to its low relevance to adverse outcomes (e.g., fluctuations in community structure, decreases in population size, and other similar ecobiologically relevant indicators of community structure and function). To mitigate these limitations, the concept of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) was developed. An AOP is an analytical, sequentially progressive pathway that links a molecular initiating event (MIE) to an adverse outcome. Recently, AOPs have been recognized as a potential informational tool by which the implications of molecular biomarkers in ERA can be better understood. To demonstrate the utility of AOPs in biomarker-based ERA, here we discuss a series of three different biological repercussions caused by exposure to benzo(a)pyrene (B. aP), silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), and selenium (Se). Using mainly aquatic invertebrates and selected vertebrates as model species, we focus on the development of the AOP concept. Aquatic organisms are suitable bioindicator species whose entire lifespans can be observed over a short period; moreover, these species can be studied on the molecular and population levels. Also, interspecific differences between aquatic organisms are important to consider in an AOP framework, since these differences are an integral part of the natural environment. The development of an environmental pollutant-mediated AOP may enable a better understanding of the effects of environmental pollutants in different scenarios in the diverse community of an ecosystem. © 2015.","Adverse outcome pathway; Aquatic organisms; Biomarker; Environmental risk assessment; Interspecific difference; Omics","Animals; Biology; Biomarkers; Organic pollutants; Pollution; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Silver; Social sciences; Adverse outcomes; Aquatic invertebrates; Environmental contamination; Environmental pollutants; Environmental risk assessment; Interspecific differences; Omics; Silver nanoparticles (AgNps); Aquatic organisms; analytical framework; aquatic organism; bioindicator; biomarker; environmental risk; interspecific variation; pyrene; risk assessment; selenium; silver; Invertebrata; Vertebrata; benzo[a]pyrene; biological marker; metal nanoparticle; selenium; silver; teratogenic agent; water pollutant; animal; aquatic species; chemically induced; drug effects; embryology; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; fish; metabolism; neoplasm; risk assessment; toxicity; veterinary; water pollutant; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Benzo(a)pyrene; Biomarkers; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Metal Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Risk Assessment; Selenium; Silver; Teratogens; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Evaluation of immune interactions that drive MM relies on in vitro experiments that do not reflect the complex cellular stroma involved in MM pathogenesis. Here we used Vk&z.ast;MYC transgenic mice, which spontaneously develop MM, and demonstrated that the immune system plays a critical role in the control of MM progression and the response to treatment. We monitored Vk&z.ast;MYC mice that had been crossed with Cd226 mutant mice over a period of 3 years and found that CD226 limits spontaneous MM development. The CD226-dependent anti-myeloma immune response against transplanted Vk&z.ast;MYC MM cells was mediated both by NK and CD8+ T cells through perforin and IFN-ã pathways. Moreover, CD226 expression was required for optimal antimyeloma efficacy of cyclophosphamide (CTX) and bortezomib (Btz), which are both standardly used to manage MM in patients. Activation of costimulatory receptor CD137 with mAb (4-1BB) exerted strong antimyeloma activity, while inhibition of coinhibitory receptors PD-1 and CTLA-4 had no effect. Taken together, the results of this study provide in vivo evidence that CD226 is important for MM immunosurveillance and indicate that specific immune components should be targeted for optimal MM treatment efficacy. As progressive immunosuppression associates with MM development, strategies aimed to increase immune functions may have important therapeutic implications in MM. © 2015, American Society for Clinical Investigation.

However, little is known about the role of TLR3 sensing of endogenous ligands in innate tumor immunosurveillance. Here, we investigated whether TLR3 could modulate immune responses and facilitate tumor control without administration of an agonist. We observed only limited impact of TLR3 deficiency on spontaneous carcinogenesis and primary growth of B16F10, E0771 or MC38 tumors when injected subcutaneously to mice. Nevertheless, TLR3 was observed to limit experimental B16F10 lung metastasis, an immunologic constraint dependent on both IFNγ secretion and NK cells. Interestingly, we observed that NK cells derived from Tlr3 null (Tlr3−/−) mice were hyporesponsive to cytokine stimulation. Indeed, compared with NK cells with intact TLR3, Tlr3−/− NK cells produced significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFNγ, when incubated in the presence of different combinations of IL-12, IL-18 and IL-15. Bone-marrow chimera experiments established that competent NK cell responses required TLR3 sensing on radio-sensitive immune cells. Intriguingly, although CD8α DCs robustly express high levels of TLR3, we found that those cells were not necessary for efficient IFNγ production by NK cells. Moreover, the defective NK cell phenotype of Tlr3−/− mice appeared to be independent of the gut microbiota. Altogether, our data demonstrate a pivotal role of endogenous TLR3 stimulation for the acquisition of full NK cell functions and immune protection against experimental metastasis. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cytokine; Metastasis; Mouse; NK cell; TLR","gamma interferon; interleukin 12p70; interleukin 15 receptor alpha; recombinant interleukin 15; toll like receptor 3; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bone marrow cell; controlled study; cytofluorometry; cytokine production; cytotoxicity; dendritic cell; flow cytometry; immune response; immunomodulation; lung metastasis; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; tumor growth; tumor immunity; upregulation"

Billions of fish are captured and released annually around the globe across all fishing sectors (e.g., recreational, commercial, subsistence). Whatever the motivation, release often occurs under the assumption of post-release survival. Yet, capture by fisheries (hereafter ""fisheries-capture"") is likely the most severe acute stressor experienced in the animal's lifetime, which makes the problem of physiological recovery and survival of relevance to biology and conservation. Indeed, fisheries managers require accurate estimates of mortality to better account for total mortality from fishing, while fishers desire guidance on strategies for reducing mortality and maintaining the welfare of released fish, to maximize current and future opportunities for fishing. In partnership with stakeholders, our team has extensively studied the effects of catch-and-release on Pacific salmon in both marine and freshwater environments, using biotelemetry and physiological assessments in a combined laboratory-based and field-based approach. The emergent theme is that post-release rates of mortality are consistently context-specific and can be affected by a suite of interacting biotic and abiotic factors. The fishing gear used, location of a fishery, water temperature, and handling techniques employed by fishers each can dramatically affect survival of the salmon they release. Variation among individuals, co-migrating populations, and between sexes all seem to play a role in the response of fish to capture and in their subsequent survival, potentially driven by pre-capture pathogen-load, maturation states, and inter-individual variation in responsiveness to stress. Although some of these findings are fascinating from a biological perspective, they all create unresolved challenges for managers. We summarize our findings by highlighting the patterns that have emerged most consistently, and point to areas of uncertainty that require further research. © The Author 2015.

Extensive laboratory research using experimental elevation of GCs in model species is instrumental in learning about stressor-induced physiological and behavioural mechanisms; however, such studies fail to inform our understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes in the wild. We reviewed emerging research that has used GC manipulations in wild vertebrates to assess GC-mediated effects on survival, physiology, behaviour, reproduction and offspring quality. Within and across taxa, exogenous manipulation of GCs increased, decreased or had no effect on traits examined in the reviewed studies. The notable diversity in responses to GC manipulation could be associated with variation in experimental methods, inherent differences among species, morphs, sexes and age classes, and the ecological conditions in which responses were measured. In their current form, results from experimental studies may be applied to animal conservation on a case-bycase basis in contexts such as threshold-based management. We discuss ways to integrate mechanistic explanations for changes in animal abundance in altered environments with functional applications that inform conservation practitioners of which species and traits may be most responsive to environmental change or human disturbance. Experimental GC manipulation holds promise for determining mechanisms underlying fitness impairment and population declines. Future work in this area should examine multiple life-history traits, with consideration of individual variation and, most importantly, validation of GC manipulations within naturally occurring and physiologically relevant ranges. © The Author 2015.","Corticosterone; Cortisol; Endocrinology; Hormone; Life history; Stress",

Salmo salar were tagged externally with radio transmitters and immediately released back into the river to simulate a realistic C&R situation. The majority of S. salar (91%) survived C&R. Most S. salar that were present in the River Otra during the spawning period 3-4 months later were located at known spawning grounds. Downstream movements (median furthest position: 0·5km, range: 0·1-11·0km) during the first 4days after release were recorded for 72% of S. salar, presumably stress-induced fallback associated with C&R. Individuals that fell back spent a median of 15days before commencing their first upstream movement after release, and 34days before they returned to or were located above their release site. Mortality appeared to be somewhat elevated at the higher end of the temperature range (14% at 18-21°C), although sample sizes were low. In conclusion, C&R at water temperatures up to 18°C had small behavioural consequences and was associated with low mortality (7%). Nevertheless, low levels of mortality occur due to C&R angling and these losses should be accounted for by management authorities in rivers where C&R is practised. Refinement of best practices for C&R may help to reduce mortality, particularly at warmer temperatures. © 2015 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","Biotelemetry; Fisheries management; Radio-telemetry; Recreational fishing","Salmo salar; animal; environmental protection; human activities; Norway; physiology; population migration; river; Salmo salar; temperature; Animal Migration; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Human Activities; Norway; Rivers; Salmo salar; Temperature"

We conducted an experimental purse seine fishery for Pacific salmon in the Juan de Fuca Strait, with a focus on understanding the relationships between different sublethal indicators and whether mortality could be predicted in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) bycatch. We monitored mortality using a ∼24-h net pen experiment (N=118) and acoustic telemetry (N=50), two approaches commonly used to assess bycatch mortality that have rarely been directly compared. Short-term mortality was 21% in the net pen experiment (∼24 h) and estimated at 20% for telemetry-tagged fish (∼48-96 h). Mortality was predicted by injury and reflex impairment, but only in the net pen experiment. Higher reflex impairment was mirrored by perturbations to plasma ions and lactate, supporting the notion that reflex impairment can be used as a proxy for departure from physiological homeostasis. Reflex impairment also significantly correlated with injury scores, while injury scores were significantly correlated with plasma ion concentrations. The higher time-specific mortality rate in the net pen and the fact that reflexes and injury corresponded with mortality in that experiment, but not in the telemetry-tagged fish released into the wild could be explained partly by confinement stress. While holding experiments offer the potential to provide insights into the underlying causes of mortality, chronic confinement stress can complicate the interpretation of patterns and ultimately affect mortality rates. Collectively, these results help refine our understanding of the different sublethal metrics used to assess bycatch and the mechanisms that can lead to mortality. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.","Acoustic telemetry in fisheries management; Biodiversity conservation; Bycatch; Conservation physiology; Fisheries management; Gillnet; Interior Fraser coho salmon; RAMP; Scale loss","Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus kisutch; animal; Canada; environmental protection; fishery; injuries; Oncorhynchus kisutch; physiological stress; telemetry; time; Animals; British Columbia; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fisheries; Oncorhynchus kisutch; Stress, Physiological; Telemetry; Time Factors"

IL-21-producing cells in the mediastinal lymph node (mLN) bore characteristics of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, whereas IL-21+ cells in the lung did not express CXCR5 (a chemokine receptor expressed by Tfh cells) and were distinct from effector Th2 or Th17 cells. Il21r-/- mice developed reduced type 2 responses and the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) enhanced Th2 cell function in a cell-intrinsic manner.

We focus on the effects of direct conflict, nuclear weapons, military training, and military produced contaminants. Overall, the aforementioned activities were found to have overwhelmingly negative effects on ecosystem structure and function. Dramatic habitat alteration, environmental pollution, and disturbance contributed to population declines and biodiversity losses arising from both acute and chronic effects in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. In some instances, even in the face of massive alterations to ecosystem structure, recovery was possible. Interestingly, military activity was beneficial under specific conditions, such as when an exclusion zone was generated that generally resulted in population increases and (or) population recovery; an observation noted in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. Additionally, military technological advances (e.g., GPS technology, drone technology, biotelemetry) have provided conservation scientists with novel tools for research. Because of the challenges associated with conducting research in areas with military activities (e.g., restricted access, hazardous conditions), information pertaining to military impacts on the environment are relatively scarce and are often studied years after military activities have ceased and with no knowledge of baseline conditions.

They may compensate for such effects by reducing, either by habituation or by natural selection, the distance at which they flee from humans (i.e., flight initiation distance), and this adaptation may improve their population trends. We analyzed population trends of common breeding birds in relation to flight initiation distance and geographical location (latitude, longitude, and marginality of the breeding distribution) across European countries from Finland in the north to Spain in the south while also considering other potential predictors of trends like farmland habitat, migration, body size, and brain size. We found evidence of farmland, migratory, and smaller-sized species showing stronger population declines. In contrast, there was no significant effect of relative brain size on population trends. We did not find evidence for main effects of flight initiation distance and geographical location on trends after accounting for confounding and interactive effects; instead, flight initiation distance and location interacted to generate complex spatial patterns of population trends. Trends were more positive for fearful populations northward, westward, and (marginally) toward the center of distribution areas and more negative for fearless populations toward the south, east, and the margins of distribution ranges. These findings suggest that it is important to consider differences in population trends among countries, but also interaction effects among factors, because such interactions can enhance or compensate for negative effects of other factors on population trends. © The Author 2014.

We compared egg appearance and egg-rejection behavior of 2 common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) hosts, the ashy-throated parrotbill (Paradoxornis alphonsianus) and the vinous-throated parrotbill (Paradoxornis webbianus) between mainland China and Taiwan population that have been segregated for 2-3 million years. Avian visual modeling showed that the mainland host population under strong selection from brood parasitism has evolved polymorphic eggs, while the island host population released from brood parasitism has maintained the original monomorphic egg phenotype. Furthermore, experiments indicated that under such long historical segregation, egg rejection in the island population decayed dramatically in the absence of cuckoo parasitism. This study provides strong evidence that egg-rejection ability can be dramatically deficient in host populations without brood parasitism compared to parasitized ones. The results further enhance our understanding of changes in egg-rejection behavior in birds without the selection pressure of brood parasitism for an extended period of time. © 2014 The Author 2014.","brood parasitism; coevolution; interclutch variation; intraclutch variation; Paradoxornis alphonsianus; Paradoxornis webbianus","avifauna; bird; brood parasitism; coevolution; ecological modeling; egg rejection; host selection; host use; host-parasite interaction; natural selection; phenotype; physiological response; polymorphism; China; Taiwan; Aves; Cuculus canorus; Paradoxornis alphonsianus; Paradoxornis webbianus"

To understand the molecular responses of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus japonicus to UV-B radiation, we measured the acute toxicity response to 96 h of UV-B radiation, and we also assessed the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, glutathione (GSH) content, and antioxidant enzyme (GST, GR, GPx, and SOD) activities after 24 h of exposure to UV-B with LD50 and half LD50 values. Also, expression patterns of p53 and hsp gene families with phosphorylation of p38 MAPK were investigated in UV-B-exposed copepods. We found that the ROS level, GSH content, and antioxidant enzyme activity levels were increased with the transcriptional upregulation of antioxidant-related genes, indicating that UV-B induces oxidative stress by generating ROS and stimulating antioxidant enzymatic activity as a defense mechanism. Additionally, we found that p53 expression was significantly increased after UV-B irradiation due to increases in the phosphorylation of the stress-responsive p38 MAPK, indicating that UV-B may be responsible for inducing DNA damage in T. japonicus. Of the hsp family genes, transcriptional levels of hsp20, hsp20.7, hsp70, and hsp90 were elevated in response to a low dose of UV-B radiation (9 kJ m- 2), suggesting that these hsp genes may be involved in cellular protection against UV-B radiation. In this paper, we performed a pathway-oriented mechanistic analysis in response to UV-B radiation, and this analysis provides a better understanding of the effects of UV-B in the intertidal benthic copepod T. japonicus. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Copepod; Heat shock protein; Oxidative stress; p38 MAPK; p53; Tigriopus japonicus; UV-B","antioxidant; chaperonin 60; complementary DNA; early pregnancy factor; genomic DNA; glutathione; glutathione transferase; heat shock protein; heat shock protein 105; heat shock protein 20; heat shock protein 40; heat shock protein 70; heat shock protein 90; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione reductase; heat shock protein 20.7; heat shock protein 70p; heat shock protein 90alpha; protein p53; superoxide dismutase; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione transferase; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; transcriptome; acute toxicity; article; benthos; cell protection; controlled study; copepod; defense mechanism; DNA damage; enzyme activity; LD 50; low energy radiation; microarray analysis; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; signal transduction; Tigriopus japonicus; ultraviolet B radiation; upregulation; Western blotting; adult; animal experiment; Article; enzyme phosphorylation; female; male; multigene family; animal; copepod; gene expression regulation; genetics; LD50; metabolism; oxidative stress; physiology; protein microarray; radiation response; ultraviolet radiation; Animals; Copepoda; Gene Expression Regulation; Glutathione; Glutathione Peroxidase; Glutathione Transferase; Lethal Dose 50; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Oxidative Stress; Protein Array Analysis; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxide Dismutase; Transcriptome; Ultraviolet Rays"

De novo sequence assembly by Trinity integrated with TransDecoder produced 36,918 contigs, including putative alternatively spliced variants. A total of 13,784 genes were identified based on Blast analysis. KEGG pathway analysis detected transcripts annotated as coding for enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, the immune system, translation, and signal transduction. Most identified enzymes and pathways were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolysis.

In this study, we investigated the effects of β-NF on the antioxidant defense systems of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus japonicus. To measure the β-NF-triggered changes in oxidative stress markers, such as intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH) concentration, residual glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, T. japonicus were exposed to β-NF (0.5 and 1 mg/L) for 72 h. Significant (P&lt;0.05) induction of the intracellular ROS content (%) was observed in 1 mg/L of β-NF exposed T. japonicus, compared to the negative control and H2O2-exposed group. The GSH levels were significantly increased in the 0.5 mg/L of β-NF-exposed group for 12 h and 1 mg/L of β-NF-exposed groups for 12-24 h. GPx, GST, and GR activities showed a significant increase in the 1 mg/L β-NF-exposed group, indicating that β-NF induces oxidative stress in T. japonicus. To understand the effects of β-NF at the level of transcript expression, a 6K microarray analysis was employed. Transcript profiles of selected antioxidant-related genes were modulated after 72 h exposure to 1 mg/L of β-NF. From microarray data, 10 GST isoforms, GR, GPx, PH-GPx, and Se-GPx were chosen for a time-course test by real-time RT-PCR. T. japonicus GST-S, GST-O, GST-M, and GST-D1 were significantly increased in a 1 mg/L β-NF-exposed group.

We investigated how predation risk caused by domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) and local breeding density affected patterns of reproductive and survival senescence in Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica) breeding semicolonially in Denmark. We recorded the abundance of cats and the number of breeding pairs at 39 breeding sites during 24 years and related these to age-specific survival rate and reproductive senescence to test predictions of the life history theory of senescence. We found evidence for actuarial senescence for the first time in this species. Survival rate increased until reaching a plateau in midlife and then decreased later. We also found that survival rate was higher for males than females. Local breeding density or predation risk did not affect survival as predicted by theory. Barn Swallows with short lives did not invest more in reproduction in early life, inconsistent with expectations for trade-offs between reproduction and survival as theory suggests. However, we found that the rate of reproductive decline during senescence was steeper for individuals exposed to intense competition, and predation pressure accelerated the rate of reproductive senescence, but only in sites with many breeding pairs. These latter results are in accordance with one of the predictions suggested by the life history theory of aging. These results emphasize the importance of considering intraspecific competition and interspecific interactions such as predation when analyzing reproductive and actuarial senescence. ©.","Aging; Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica; Denmark; Density dependence; Domestic cat Felis silvestris catus; Early-life environment; Intraspecific competition; Life history theory; Life span; Longevity; Predation risk; Senescence","aging; breeding site; density dependence; environmental conditions; felid; intraspecific competition; life history theory; longevity; passerine; predation risk; senescence; survival; trade-off; Denmark; Aves; Felis catus; Hirundo; Hirundo rustica; Passeriformes; aging; animal; clutch size; environment; female; male; physiology; swallow (bird); Aging; Animals; Clutch Size; Environment; Female; Male; Swallows"

Darwin (1868) described in detail how domestication resulted in loss of fear in birds and mammals, and that a number of different kinds of flight behavior seen in wild animals were lost when animals lived in human proximity. Hediger (1934) synthesized the literature on escape behavior including the distance at which animals became alert and that at which they fled an approaching predator, including humans, in a diverse array of organisms. The review by Hediger explicitly noted that different components of escape such as FID, flight direction, and alert distance (AD) reflected different aspects of flight behavior that could all, or in different combinations, change over the course of evolution. Hediger also pointed out how individuals, populations, and species differed in escape behavior, and that island populations showed less fear than mainland populations of the same or related species. Rand (1964) showed that FID was inversely related to body temperature in a lizard, implying that FID varied with risk of predation. Cooke (1980) noticed that urban birds had much shorter flight distances than rural populations of the same species, and that this difference depended on body size, the difference being larger in small species with high metabolism. This change in behavior was functional in the sense that it allowed birds to coexist with humans even at high human population densities that caused frequent disturbance. Burger (1981), Burger and Gochfeld (1981), and several others noticed that human disturbance affected FID at seabird colonies, and that such disturbance could result in habitat use alteration and reduced reproductive performance. These early studies placed research on escape behavior and FID firmly in the context of conservation biology, where it has remained ever since (Blumstein & Fernández-Juricic 2010). In this chapter I use the definitions of FID and related terms as described in Chapter 1. Starting distance (SD) and AD are aspects of escape behavior that arise for methodological or biological reasons, and some of these components show significant covariation with FID (e.g., Blumstein 2003). © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,

Four different measures of urbanization have been proposed: (1) year when a rural population became urbanized, as judged by direct observations of the first reproducing individuals in the urban habitat; (2) the difference in population density between urban and rural habitats with higher density in urban habitats reflecting more ancient and hence more advanced urbanization; (3) at least one urban population having higher population density in urban than in nearby rural populations of the same species; and (4) records of reproduction in city centers. The three largest mean effect sizes (Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient) reflecting likelihood of urbanization of birds were 0.47 for predation-related factors, 0.46 for geographic range and population density, and 0.29 for body size. The year of urbanization for different populations of the same bird species had a repeatability of 0.44 among sites. The difference in population density between nearby urban and rural habitats had a repeatability of 0.26 among the same sites. Selection for adaptation to the novel urban environment included (1) a reduction in dispersal propensity and hence a reduction in morphology associated with efficient flight or movement; (2) changes in vocalizations of birds and other organisms to cope with altered urban noise; (3) changes in songs and positions in the vegetation used for song related to changes in a predator community between rural and urban habitats; (4) changes in flight distance due to change in predator community; and (5) a change in flight behavior in response to the proximity of humans toward perpendicular flights away from the walking direction of humans to avoid human disturbance. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Dispersal; Flight initiation distance; Heat island effect; Indicator ability; Selection; Spatial scale; Temporal scale; Urbanization",

Previous studies have shown that urban populations of birds have shorter flight initiation distances than rural populations of the same species, that this difference is partly explained by differences in the community of predators, and that a longer history of urbanization implies a greater reduction in flight initiation distance in urban populations. The use of birdfeeders may be an additional factor reducing flight initiation distance not only in cities but also elsewhere by among other effects increasing body condition, increasing availability and reliability of food, and hence reducing the relative cost of flight. Here, we tested the prediction that urban habitats and presence of feeders independently accounted for reductions in flight initiation distance using extensive samples from different cities in Poland.

In 2 manipulations in nearshore areas, queen conchs were equipped with accelerometers and released in adjacent coral rubble or seagrass habitats. Queen conchs were located approximately every 6 h during daylight by snorkeling, to measure individual differences in linear distance moved, and after 24 h they were relocated to an alternate habitat (24 h in each habitat). We found significant inter-individual variability in activity levels, but more consistent levels of activity between the 2 habitat types within individual queen conchs. Four (36%) of the individuals placed in seagrass moved back to the adjacent coral rubble habitat, suggesting selectivity for coral rubble. Individuals showed variable behavioural responses when relocated to the less preferable seagrass habitat, which may be related to differing stress-coping styles. Our results suggest that behavioural variability between individuals may be an important factor driving movement and habitat use in queen conch and, potentially, their susceptibility to human stressors.

Predation is one of the underlying mechanisms accounting for viability costs of sexual displays. Therefore, we should expect that individuals of the two sexes adjust their anti-predator behaviour in response to changes in predation risk. We conducted a meta-analysis of 28 studies (42 species) of sex differences in risk-taking behaviour in lizards and tested whether these differences could be explained by sexual dichromatism, by sexual size dimorphism or by latitude. Latitude was the best predictor of the interspecific heterogeneity in sex-specific behaviour. Males did not change their escape behaviour with latitude, whereas females had increasingly reduced wariness at higher latitudes. We hypothesize that this sex difference in risk-taking behaviour is linked to sex-specific environmental constraints that more strongly affect the reproductive effort of females than males. This novel latitudinal effect on sex-specific anti-predator behaviour has important implications for responses to climate change and for the relative roles of natural and sexual selection in different species. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Meteorological differences advance and prolong the growing season in urban habitats compared to nearby rural areas. In turn, urban bird populations may potentially start singing earlier, and reproduce earlier and more frequently than rural populations. However, this prediction has previously only been tested with data from single species using single spatial replicates from rural and urban sites. Here we provide the first general (paired urban and rural populations of 54 bird species) and large-scale (a 3800 km long latitudinal gradient across Europe) empirical evidence for longer and earlier singing periods in urban compared to rural habitats. Effects of urbanization on start and duration of the singing period (as a proxy for the breeding season) were positively related to size of cities and ecological characteristics of species. Bird species that have been urbanized for a long time started to sing earlier and had a more extended singing period in urban compared to rural habitats. We also found that the singing period started later and was shorter at higher latitudes. Geographical variation in phenology was related to temperature and rainfall, although differences between urban and rural habitats were not. Differences in duration of singing periods between paired urban and rural sites were as large as latitudinal differences between southern and northern Europe (5, 6 and 28 d for 3 common species, as compared to a mean latitudinal variation of 17.1 d). This suggests local adjustment to urban environments, either due to evolution or to plasticity of phenological behaviour. © Inter-Research 2015.","Phenology; Population density; Singing periods; Urbanization","bird; environmental disturbance; geographical variation; growing season; phenology; population density; rainfall; rural population; urban population; urbanization; Europe; Aves"

This migration is the basis for recreational fisheries, which for conservation reasons are increasingly characterized by catch-and-release angling. The effectiveness of catch and release for Atlantic Salmon conservation is contingent on the ability of individuals to recover from angling, resume migration, and reach spawning grounds at appropriate times. We monitored 27 caught and released Atlantic Salmon in River Gaula in 2013, a prominent and relatively pristine Norwegian river, by affixing external radio transmitters to them. Those fish were compared with a control group of 33 individuals caught and radio-tagged at sea in bag nets before river entry. Whereas none of the control fish died during the study period, there were three mortalities among the caught-and-released fish (11%; significant difference). All mortalities were qualitatively associated with poor angler care, emphasizing the responsibility of anglers in practicing effective catch and release of Atlantic Salmon. Both control and caught and released Atlantic Salmon spent similar time resting below and in transiting a large natural barrier to migration, an 80-m gorge. The angled and released Atlantic Salmon were distributed in similar locations throughout the river during the spawning season compared with control fish, but those caught and released later in the season appeared to migrate shorter total distances than control fish. Among the caught and released Atlantic Salmon, 17% were recaptured by anglers, which was similar to the rate of recapture of the control fish (21%). Ultimately, individual and population fitness was not likely to be significantly compromised as a result of catch and release because individuals were recorded in spawning areas at appropriate times. Catch and release can therefore be considered a tenable strategy for balancing the costs and benefits associated with the recreational fishery.Received September 26, 2014; accepted December 16, 2014 © 2015, American Fisheries Society.",,"adult; angling; catchability; fitness; migratory behavior; mortality risk; salmonid fishery; spawning population; Gaula River; Norway; Norway; Sor Trondelag; Salmo salar"

Patterns of precipitation, wind and extreme weather have likewise changed considerably. These changes have prompted an enormous interest in the potential impact of climate change (and other components of global change) on all living beings. Environmental indicators of climate change should be easy to apply, consistent over time and space, reliable, and informative. The biological impact of climate change has been assessed with the help of environmental indicators such as change in phenology and change in distribution. Indicators of change in phenology include advanced spring arrival date of migratory birds, advanced first date of singing by birds and advanced first flowering date of plants in response to change in temperature. Indicators of change in distribution include change in the northernmost range limit of butterflies and birds. While there is a huge literature on responses to climate change, there is little assessment of the indicator ability of different biological responses to climate change. Here I briefly review environmental indicators of climate change; rank the response of different species in terms of their indicator ability; test for consistency in indicator ability over time; and test for consistency in indicator ability among indicators.

Biologging and biotelemetry tools can help address this problem. An open channel flume was used to generate volitional swimming speed (Us) estimates of cultured lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) and these were paired with simultaneously recorded accelerometer-derived metrics of activity obtained from three types of data-storage tags. This study examined whether a predictive relationship could be established between four different activity metrics (tail-beat frequency (TBF), tail-beat acceleration amplitude (TBAA), overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), and vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA)) and the swimming speed of A. fulvescens. Volitional Us of sturgeon ranged from 0.48 to 2.70 m·s−1 (0.51–3.18 body lengths (BL) · s−1). Swimming speed increased linearly with all accelerometer-derived metrics, and when all tag types were combined, Us increased 0.46 BL·s−1 for every 1 Hz increase in TBF, and 0.94, 0.61, and 0.94 BL·s−1 for every 1g increase in TBAA, ODBA, and VeDBA, respectively.

This results in an optimal flight initiation distance (FID) at which the risk of remaining and the cost of flight are equal. Thus, FID is strongly negatively correlated with susceptibility to predation by the sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus across species of small European birds. However, not everything that looks like a hawk is in fact a hawk. Aggressive mimicry arises from the resemblance between a dangerous model such as a predatory hawk and an innocuous mimic such as a cuckoo that makes errors made by individuals that encounter models and mimics potentially dangerous and life threatening. A prime example of such aggressive mimicry is the hawk-like appearance of common cuckoos Cuculus canorus and other cuckoos. If mimicry is efficient, we should expect that species of small birds that are prey of hawks and hosts of cuckoos react just as strongly to a cuckoo as to the presence of a dangerous model like a sparrowhawk. We used FID of small birds as a measure of the reaction of prey to models and mimics, predicting that FID would be negatively related to susceptibility to predation and positively to risk of cuckoo parasitism. Both susceptibility to sparrowhawk predation and rate of brood parasitism by the common cuckoo independently explained variation in FID, consistent with the expectation that both hawks and cuckoos have imposed significant selection pressures on FID and that species of small birds perceive cuckoos as true mimics of hawks. © The Author 2015.

Freshwater turtle populations are particularly susceptible to increases in adult mortality, and freshwater turtles are among the most threatened vertebrates. As a case study, the population-level impacts of bycatch mortality on freshwater turtles were evaluated in Lake Opinicon, Ontario, Canada, a lake that supports a small-scale commercial fishery. Using population viability analyses, the impacts of bycatch on common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), eastern musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus), northern map turtles (Graptemys geographica), and painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) were evaluated. In all four species, even low levels of additional annual female mortality as a result of bycatch were sufficient either to reduce population size or to cause extirpation of the local population within 500years. Bycatch reduction programmes, such as seasonal closures and implementation of bycatch reduction devices, can help alleviate the risk of extirpation. Changes to fishing season length could help reduce the number of snapping turtles and musk turtles captured. Installation of simple bycatch reduction devices can exclude between 95% and 100% of snapping turtles and between 0% and 97% of the other three species, depending on the width of the exclusion device. If combined, these two bycatch reduction methods would help prevent adult female mortality and help maintain turtle populations in Lake Opinicon. Although these findings are specific to the study area, the same principles apply to other areas where similar simple bycatch reduction strategies can be employed to prevent the extirpation of other freshwater turtle species. Considering the consequences of bycatch and of bycatch reduction programmes on populations provides managers with important information to support development of risk-averse conservation strategies. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Conservation evaluation; Fishing; Lake; Protected species; Reptiles","Chelydra serpentina; Chelydra serpentina serpentina; Chelydridae; Chrysemys; Chrysemys picta; Graptemys; Graptemys geographica; Reptilia; Sternotherus odoratus; Testudines; Vertebrata"

The goal of this study was to evaluate the interconnectedness of an urban stream (Watts Creek) and adjoining earthen surface stormwater drain (Kizell Drain) from the perspective of fish residency and movements over an entire year. Using a stationary passive integrated transponder (PIT) array, we quantified and compared the direction of movements among Watts Creek, Kizell Drain, and the area downstream of their confluence (herein termed Main) for four common stream fishes. We also determined the residency time (percentage of total time in days) within each of these reaches by combining data from the array and recaptured (with electrofishing and identified with hand-held PIT reader) or portably detected (with mobile PIT reader) fish. While the movements of creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) and central mudminnow (Umbra limi) varied across seasons, creek chub resided significantly longer in Watts, while central mudminnow spent more time in Kizell and Main. Longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae) moved into and resided most often within Watts. The movements and residency time for white sucker (Catostomus commersonii) did not vary among the reaches. We conclude there is a high degree of connectivity between Watts Creek and Kizell Drain and that, with the exception of longnose dace, the three other species utilize the habitat available in Kizell. This study demonstrates the biological potential of earthen stormwater drains and as a result we recommend these systems be managed as a functional component of urban watersheds. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","PIT; Stormwater drains; Stream fish; Urban ecology; Winter","data set; fish; habitat type; movement; seasonal variation; stormwater; stream; temperate environment; urban area; winter; Canada; Ottawa River; Catostomus commersoni; Catostomus commersonii; Pisces; Rhinichthys cataractae; Semotilus; Semotilus atromaculatus; Umbra limi"

Inhibition of BRAFV600E by oncogene targeting therapy increases overall survival of patients with melanoma, but is unable to produce many durable responses. Adaptive drug resistance remains the main limitation to BRAFV600E inhibitor clinical efficacy and immune-based strategies could be useful to overcome disease relapse. Tumor microenvironment greatly differs between visceral metastasis and primary cutaneous melanoma, and the mechanisms involved in the antimetastatic efficacy of BRAFV600E inhibitors remain to be determined. To address this question, we developed a metastatic BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma cell line and demonstrated that the antimetastatic properties of BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 (a research analogue of vemurafenib) require host natural killer (NK) cells and perforin. Indeed, PLX4720 not only directly limited BRAFV600E-induced tumor cell proliferation, but also affected NK cell functions. We showed that PLX4720 increases the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, CD69 expression, and proliferation of mouse NK cells in vitro. NK cell frequencies were significantly enhanced by PLX4720 specifically in the lungs of mice with BRAFV600E lung metastases. Furthermore, PLX4720 also increased human NK cell pERK1/2, CD69 expression, and IFNγ release in the context of anti-NKp30 and IL2 stimulation. Overall, this study supports the idea that additional NK cell-based immunotherapy (by checkpoint blockade or agonists or cytokines) may combine well with BRAFV600E inhibitor therapy to promote more durable responses in melanoma. ©2014 AACR.",,"B Raf kinase; CD69 antigen; gamma interferon; interleukin 2; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mutant protein; n [3 (5 chloro 1h pyrrolo[2,3 b]pyridine 3 carbonyl) 2,4 difluorophenyl]propanesulfonamide; natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 3; perforin; B Raf kinase; BRAF protein, human; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antigen expression; Article; cancer immunotherapy; controlled study; cytokine release; drug efficacy; drug response; enzyme phosphorylation; gene mutation; human; human cell; in vitro study; lung metastasis; lymphocyte function; lymphocyte proliferation; male; melanoma cell line; metastasis inhibition; metastatic melanoma; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; tumor growth; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cell proliferation; drug resistance; genetics; immunology; immunotherapy; melanoma; metabolism; metastasis; mutation; natural killer cell; pathology; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Humans; Immunotherapy; Killer Cells, Natural; Melanoma; Mice; Mutation; Neoplasm Metastasis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Signal Transduction"

The walleye (Sander vitreus) is an economically and ecologically important native fish species throughout the Great Lakes. In Lake Huron walleye has recently undergone a population expansion as a result of recovery of the primary stock, stemming from changing food web dynamics. During 2011 and 2012, we used acoustic telemetry to document the timing and spatial scale of walleye migration in Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay. Spawning walleye (n=199) collected from a tributary of Saginaw Bay were implanted with acoustic tags and their migrations were documented using acoustic receivers (n=140) deployed throughout U.S. nearshore waters of Lake Huron. Three migration pathways were described using multistate mark-recapture models. Models were evaluated using the Akaike Information Criterion. Fish sex did not influence migratory behavior but did affect migration rate and walleye were detected on all acoustic receiver lines. Most (95%) tagged fish migrated downstream from the riverine tagging and release location to Saginaw Bay, and 37% of these fish emigrated from Saginaw Bay into Lake Huron. Remarkably, 8% of walleye that emigrated from Saginaw Bay were detected at the acoustic receiver line located farthest from the release location more than 350 km away. Most (64%) walleye returned to the Saginaw River in 2012, presumably for spawning.

Forest succession in conjunction with lack of forest management started gradually transforming the landscape. During the last 28years dead wood and litter have dramatically accumulated in these areas, whereas climate change has increased temperature and favored drought. The present situation in these forests suggests an increased risk of wildfires, especially after the pronounced forest fires of 2010, which remobilized Chernobyl-deposited radioactive materials transporting them thousand kilometers far. For the aforementioned reasons, we study the consequences of different forest fires on the redistribution of 137Cs. Using the time frequency of the fires that occurred in the area during 2010, we study three scenarios assuming that 10%, 50% and 100% of the area are burnt. We aim to sensitize the scientific community and the European authorities for the foreseen risks from radioactivity redistribution over Europe. The global model LMDZORINCA that reads deposition density of radionuclides and burnt area from satellites was used, whereas risks for the human and animal population were calculated using the Linear No-Threshold (LNT) model and the computerized software ERICA Tool, respectively. Depending on the scenario, whereas between 20 and 240 humans may suffer from solid cancers, of which 10-170 may be fatal. ERICA predicts insignificant changes in animal populations from the fires, whereas the already extreme radioactivity background plays a major role in their living quality. The resulting releases of 137Cs after hypothetical wildfires in Chernobyl's forests are classified as high in the International Nuclear Events Scale (INES). The estimated cancer incidents and fatalities are expected to be comparable to those predicted for Fukushima.

They function as transcriptional regulators to control expression of genes involved in development, homeostasis, and metabolism. The number of NRs differs from species to species, because of gene duplications and/or lineage-specific gene losses during metazoan evolution. Many NRs in arthropods interact with the ecdysteroid hormone and are involved in ecdysone-mediated signaling in arthropods. The nuclear receptor superfamily complement has been reported in several arthropods, including crustaceans, but not in copepods. We identified the entire NR repertoire of the copepod Tigriopus japonicus, which is an important marine model species for ecotoxicology and environmental genomics. Results: Using whole genome and transcriptome sequences, we identified a total of 31 nuclear receptors in the genome of T. japonicus. Nomenclature of the nuclear receptors was determined based on the sequence similarities of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD). The 7 subfamilies of NRs separate into five major clades (subfamilies NR1, NR2, NR3, NR4, and NR5/6). Although the repertoire of NR members in, T. japonicus was similar to that reported for other arthropods, there was an expansion of the NR1 subfamily in Tigriopus japonicus. The twelve unique nuclear receptors identified in T. japonicus are members of NR1L. This expansion may be a unique lineage-specific feature of crustaceans. Interestingly, E78 and HR83, which are present in other arthropods, were absent from the genomes of T. japonicus and two congeneric copepod species (T. japonicus and Tigriopus californicus), suggesting copepod lineage-specific gene loss. Conclusions: We identified all NR receptors present in the copepod, T. japonicus. Knowledge of the copepod nuclear receptor repertoire will contribute to a better understanding of copepod- and crustacean-specific NR evolution. © 2014 Hwang et al.","Copepod; Ecdysone signaling; Nuclear receptor","cell nucleus receptor; cell receptor; Article; cladistics; controlled study; copepod; DNA binding domain; gene; gene identification; gene loss; gene nomenclature; gene sequence; genetic parameters; genetic similarity; genome analysis; ligand binding domain; nonhuman; NR1 gene; NR2 gene; NR3 gene; NR4 gene; NR5 gene; NR6 gene; nuclear receptor gene; nucleotide sequence; phylogenetic tree; sequence analysis; Tigriopus californicus; Tigriopus japonicus; animal; chemistry; Chordata; copepod; genetics; genome; multigene family; nomenclature; phylogeny; protein tertiary structure; species difference; Arthropoda; Copepoda; Crustacea; Metazoa; Tigriopus californicus; Tigriopus japonicus; Animals; Chordata; Copepoda; Genome; Multigene Family; Phylogeny; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Species Specificity; Terminology as Topic"

The causes of spatial patterns in population trends and their relationship with animal responses to human proximity are even less known.Methodology/Principal Finding: We investigated the relationship between population trends of 193 species of bird in North America, Australia and Europe and flight initiation distance (FID); the distance at which birds take flight when approached by a human. While there is an expected negative relationship between population trend and FID in Australia and Europe, we found the inverse relationship for North American birds; thus FID cannot be used as a universal predictor of vulnerability of birds. However, the analysis of the joint explanatory ability of multiple drivers (farmland breeding habitat, pole-most breeding latitude, migratory habit, FID) effects on population status replicated previously reported strong effects of farmland breeding habitat (an effect apparently driven mostly by European birds), as well as strong effects of FID, body size, migratory habit and continent.

Omics platforms are useful approaches for the study of organs and organisms. These approaches can be powerful screening tools for whole genome, proteome, and metabolome profiling, and can be used to understand molecular changes in response to internal and external stimuli. This methodology has been applied successfully in freshwater model fish such as the zebrafish Danio rerio and the Japanese medaka Oryzias latipes in research areas such as basic physiology, developmental biology, genetics, and environmental biology. However, information is still scarce about model fish that inhabit brackish water or seawater. To develop the self-fertilizing killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus as a potential model species with unique characteristics and research merits, we obtained genomic information about K. marmoratus. We address ways to use these data for genome-based molecular mechanistic studies. We review the current state of genome information on K. marmoratus to initiate omics approaches. We evaluate the potential applications of integrated omics platforms for future studies in environmental science, developmental biology, and biomedical research. We conclude that information about the K. marmoratus genome will provide a better understanding of the molecular functions of genes, proteins, and metabolites that are involved in the biological functions of this species.

After an 8-h exposure, significantly higher increases in the relative ROS and total GSH levels were observed in exposed group, compared to the controls. Real-time PCR data revealed that the expression levels of GPx and GR mRNA were sensitively modulated within 8. h of exposure to all heavy metals.

Here we identify the absolute requirement for myeloid cell leukaemia sequence-1 (Mcl1) in the sustained survival of NK cells in vivo. Mcl1 is highly expressed in NK cells and regulated by IL-15 in a dose-dependent manner via STAT5 phosphorylation and subsequent binding to the 3'-UTR of Mcl1. Specific deletion of Mcl1 in NK cells results in the absolute loss of NK cells from all tissues owing to a failure to antagonize pro-apoptotic proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane. This NK lymphopenia results in mice succumbing to multiorgan melanoma metastases, being permissive to allogeneic transplantation and being resistant to toxic shock following polymicrobial sepsis challenge.

During the early parental care period when males are guarding fresh eggs (MG-FE), cortisol responsiveness is attenuated; the response is re-established when males reach the end of the parental care period and are guarding free-swimming fry (MG-FSF). It was hypothesized that attenuation of the cortisol response in male smallmouth bass during early parental care reflected modulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis function. Male smallmouth bass were sampled at the beginning (MG-FE) and end of the parental care period (MG-FSF), before and/or 25. min after exposure to a standardized stressor consisting of 3. min of air exposure. Repeated sampling of stressed fish for analysis of plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels was carried out. Males significantly elevated both plasma cortisol and ACTH levels when guarding free-swimming fry but not during early parental care. Control and stressed fish were terminally sampled for tissue mRNA abundance of preoptic area (POA) and hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) as well as head kidney melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc). No significant differences in either hypothalamus CRF or head kidney P450scc mRNA abundance were found across parental care stages or in response to stress. However, POA CRF mRNA abundance and interrenal cell MC2R and StAR mRNA abundances failed to increase in response to stress in MG-FE. Thus, the attenuated cortisol response in males guarding fresh eggs may be explained by hypoactive HPI axis function in response to stress. The present is one of few studies, and the first teleost study, to address the mechanisms underlying resistance to stress during the reproductive/parental care period. © 2014.","Cortisol; CRF; HPI axis; MC2R; Parental care; Smallmouth bass","cholesterol monooxygenase (side chain cleaving); complementary DNA; corticotropin; corticotropin releasing factor; cytochrome P450; hydrocortisone; melanocortin 2 receptor; messenger RNA; steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; corticotropin releasing factor; hydrocortisone; melanocortin 2 receptor; messenger RNA; air; article; DNA synthesis; egg production; environmental exposure; fry (fish); head kidney; hormone determination; hydrocortisone blood level; hypothalamic pituitary interrenal axis function; hypothalamus; hypothalamus hypophysis system; male; Micropterus; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; prenatal care; preoptic area; priority journal; progeny; smallmouth bass; stress; animal; bass; blood; genetics; growth, development and aging; hypothalamus hypophysis system; metabolism; physiology; real time polymerase chain reaction; reproduction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Animals; Bass; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone; Head Kidney; Hydrocortisone; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Male; Preoptic Area; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 2; Reproduction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger"

The frequency of males with aspermy increased logarithmically with radiation level. While 18.4% of males from contaminated areas had no sperm that was only the case for 3.0% of males from uncontaminated control areas. Furthermore, there were negative relationships between sperm quality as reflected by reduced sperm velocity and motility, respectively, and radiation.

However, its importance in spontaneous epithelial cancer is still poorly defined. In this study, we use a realistic mouse model that displays many features that are equivalent to human pathology to evaluate the role of pfp-dependent immunosurveillance by comparing tumor progression in rat ERBB-2 (neu) transgenic, pfp-proficient (neu+/pfp+) or pfp-deficient (neu+/pfp-) BALB/c male mice. Adult neu +/pfp+ males developed poorly differentiated salivary carcinomas, whereas neu+/pfp- males displayed their salivary carcinomas noticeably earlier and showed zones of more highly differentiated tumor, indicating that pfp-mediated immunosurveillance is able not only to delay the growth kinetic of an aggressive epithelial tumor, but also to shape its histology. The role of pfp-mediated immunosurveillance appeared to be of even more dramatic importance against the less aggressive male mammary carcinomas. In neu+/pfp+ males, the incidence of mammary carcinomas was a sporadic and late event. In contrast, in neu+/pfp- males their incidence was four-fold higher. This higher cancer incidence was associated with a 2-fold higher occurrence of persisting mammary remnants, a major risk factor for mammary cancer in male mice, and one that would appear to be due to pfp's previously unidentified involvement in male mammary gland rejection during embryogenesis. This work thus provides further proof of the complex role that the immune system plays in the body and gives new insight into the pathogenesis of epithelial tumors, demonstrating that the penetrance and malignancy of a tumor may be dramatically affected by pfp-dependent mechanisms.

This colony showed a 15-fold increase from 1925 until the mid-1990's, followed by a rapid decline in recent years, although the causes of this trend remain unknown. Most birds from the colony winter in the Wadden Sea, from which environmental data and information on the size of the main diet, the mussel Mytilus edulis stock exists. We hypothesised that changes in nutrients and water temperature in the Wadden Sea had an effect on the ecosystem affecting the size of mussel stocks, the principal food item for eiders, thereby influencing the number of breeding eider in the Christiansø colony. Methodology/Principal Finding: A positive relationship between the amount of fertilizer used by farmers and the concentration of phosphorus in the Wadden Sea (with a time lag of one year) allowed analysis of the predictions concerning effects of nutrients for the period 1925-2010. There was (1) increasing amounts of fertilizer used in agriculture and this increased the amount of nutrients in the marine environment thereby increasing the mussel stocks in the Wadden Sea. (2) The number of eiders at Christiansø increased when the amount of fertilizer increased. Finally (3) the number of eiders in the colony at Christiansø increased with the amount of mussel stocks in the Wadden Sea. Conclusions/Significance: The trend in the number of eiders at Christiansø is representative for the entire flyway population, and since nutrient reduction in the marine environment occurs in most parts of Northwest Europe, we hypothesize that this environmental candidate parameter is involved in the overall regulation of the Baltic/Wadden Sea eider population during recent decades. © 2014 Laursen, Møller.",,"fertilizer; phosphorus; article; Baltic Sea; concentration (parameters); duck; environmental change; female; fertilizer application; marine environment; mussel; nonhuman; nutrient availability; nutrient concentration; nutrient content; population density; Somateria mollissima; water temperature; animal; bivalve; ecosystem; physiology; reproduction; Animals; Bivalvia; Ecosystem; Reproduction"

In the first phase, Elimination, transformed cells are destroyed by a competent immune system. Sporadic tumor cells that manage to survive immune destruction may then enter an Equilibrium phase where editing occurs. The Escape phase represents the third and final phase of the process, where immunologically sculpted tumors begin to grow progressively, become clinically apparent and establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

Despite these hallmarks that reflect tissue-specific specialization in NK cells, little is known about the factors that control the development of these distinct subsets. The basic leucine zipper transcription factor Nfil3 (E4bp4) is essential for bone marrow-derived NK cell development, but it is not clear whether Nfil3 is equally important for all NK cell subsets or how it induces NK lineage commitment. In this article, we show that Nfil3 is required for the formation of Eomes-expressing NK cells, including conventional medullary and thymic NK cells, whereas TRAIL+ Eomes- NK cells develop independently of Nfil3. Loss of Nfil3 during the development of bone marrow-derived NK cells resulted in reduced expression of Eomes and, conversely, restoration of Eomes expression in Nfil3-/- progenitors rescued NK cell development and maturation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that Nfil3 drives the formation of mature NK cells by inducing Eomes expression and reveal the differential requirements of NK cell subsets for Nfil3.

Therefore, we propose the working definition: In an ecological context, carryover effects occur in any situation in which an individual's previous history and experience explains their current performance in a given situation. This concept of carryover effects provides an explicit but highly flexible context for examining the mechanisms that drive non-lethal interactions between distinct periods of an organism's lifetime, and unites the currently disparate fields investigating these effects in ecological systems. Greater communication among research fields and identifying mechanisms of carryover effects at different time scales will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the factors influencing variation in individual fitness. © 2014 O'Connor et al.","Carry over effect; Delayed effect; Latent effect; Life-history trade-off; Maternal effect; Reproductive trade-off",

As different traits of an organism covary, genetic correlations are expected to affect evolutionary trajectories. However, only limited empirical data are available. Methodology/Principal Findings:We investigate the extent to which multivariate constraints affect the rate of adaptation, focusing on four morphological traits often shown to harbour large amounts of genetic variance and considered to be subject to limited evolutionary constraints. Our data set includes unique long-term data for seven bird species and a total of 10 populations. We estimate population-specific matrices of genetic correlations and multivariate selection coefficients to predict evolutionary responses to selection. Using Bayesian methods that facilitate the propagation of errors in estimates, we compare (1) the rate of adaptation based on predicted response to selection when including genetic correlations with predictions from models where these genetic correlations were set to zero and (2) the multivariate evolvability in the direction of current selection to the average evolvability in random directions of the phenotypic space. We show that genetic correlations on average decrease the predicted rate of adaptation by 28%. Multivariate evolvability in the direction of current selection was systematically lower than average evolvability in random directions of space. These significant reductions in the rate of adaptation and reduced evolvability were due to a general nonalignment of selection and genetic variance, notably orthogonality of directional selection with the size axis along which most (60%) of the genetic variance is found. Conclusions: These results suggest that genetic correlations can impose significant constraints on the evolution of avian morphology in wild populations. This could have important impacts on evolutionary dynamics and hence population persistence in the face of rapid environmental change. © 2014 Teplitsky et al.",,"article; Bayes theorem; body height; body mass; body size; controlled study; directional selection; diversifying selection; genetic correlation; genetic parameters; genetic variability; morphological adaptation; morphological trait; multivariate analysis; multivariate constraint; nonhuman; phenotypic variation; adaptation; animal; bird; evolution; genetic selection; genetics; physiology; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Biological Evolution; Birds; Genetic Variation; Selection, Genetic"

This study presents a comprehensive review of how acoustic detection range has been considered and assessed to date, summarizes important variables to monitor when determining the detection range of a receiver array, and provides recommendations to account for detection range during experimental design, analysis and data interpretation. A total of 378 passive acoustic telemetry studies (1986-2012) were scored against a set of pre-defined criteria to provide a standardized assessment of how well detection range was accounted for, from a maximum possible score of 45. Scores ranged from 0 to 39 (11.1 ± 0.4; mean ± 1 SE). Over the past decade mean scores have been consistently between 6.7 and 12.9 which indicates that detection range has not been adequately considered in most contemporary acoustic telemetry studies. Given the highly variable nature of detection range over space and time, it is necessary to create a culture of detection range testing among the scientific community. For robust telemetry studies it is recommended that consideration of detection range should be given a greater focus within study design, execution and data analysis. To aid array design in new systems, short-term detection range tests should be conducted in the most representative area of the study system prior to deployment. As well, fixed distance sentinel tags should ideally be deployed at a representative receiver site within the array to provide a continuous assessment of detection range and influential environmental parameters should be monitored to facilitate modeling of detection range variability over time. When warranted, data analysis should incorporate modeled variation in detection ranges. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Acoustic telemetry; Animal movement; Detection range; Passive telemetry; Range test; Ultrasonic telemetry",

Results were also frequently misinterpreted and not replicable, so claims that fish feel pain remain unsubstantiated. Comparable problems exist in studies of invertebrates. In contrast, an extensive literature involving surgeries with fishes shows normal feeding and activity immediately or soon after surgery. C fiber nociceptors, the most prevalent type in mammals and responsible for excruciating pain in humans, are rare in teleosts and absent in elasmobranchs studied to date. A-delta nociceptors, not yet found in elasmobranchs, but relatively common in teleosts, likely serve rapid, less noxious injury signaling, triggering escape and avoidance responses. Clearly, fishes have survived well without the full range of nociception typical of humans or other mammals, a circumstance according well with the absence of the specialized cortical regions necessary for pain in humans. We evaluate recent claims for consciousness in fishes, but find these claims lack adequate supporting evidence, neurological feasibility, or the likelihood that consciousness would be adaptive. Even if fishes were conscious, it is unwarranted to assume that they possess a human-like capacity for pain. Overall, the behavioral and neurobiological evidence reviewed shows fish responses to nociceptive stimuli are limited and fishes are unlikely to experience pain. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Consciousness; Construct validity; Emotion; Fish; Nociception; Pain","behavioral response; feeding; fish; injury; signaling; Elasmobranchii; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Pisces; Teleostei"

However, only recently have researchers begun using electronic tags to elucidate the processes that relate directly to fitness, i.e. the ability of organisms to survive and reproduce. We briefly review the history of tracking studies focused on marine vertebrates and then provide a general overview of studies that have used tracking to address fitnessrelated questions. Although many studies have used at-sea movement and activity data to better understand feeding ecology, physio logy, and energetics, there is growing interest in the coupling of electronic tracking techniques with other disciplines to resolve the mechanisms underlying individual fitness, or more precisely the proxies thereof (survival, timing of reproduction, foraging success, etc.). We categorized studies into 4 general fitness-related areas: (1) foraging dynamics, energetics, and growth; (2) migration and other non-breeding season activities; (3) survival; and (4) reproduction. Despite recent advances in tracking technologies, which include multi-sensor loggers, tri-axial accelerometers, and miniaturized geo positioning systems, etc., very few studies on wild marine vertebrates truly measure individual fitness or proxies thereof. There is thus a need to design experimental, multi-disciplinary, and longitudinal studies that use genetics, individual-based modeling, and other techniques in an effort to resolve the mechanisms responsible for individual variation in fitness in marine vertebrates. © Inter-Research 2014.","Behaviour; Biologging; Electronic sensors; Electronic tracking; Life history; Migration; Mortality; Non-breeding; Reproduction; Survival; Telemetry","accelerometer; biotelemetry; breeding season; feeding ecology; fitness; foraging efficiency; future prospect; life history trait; marine ecosystem; migratory behavior; mortality; research work; survival; tagging; tracking"

Mice that lack DNAM-1 display abnormal T cell responses and antitumor activity; however, the mechanism involved is unclear. In this article, we show that DNAM-1 deficiency results in reduced proliferation of CD8+ T cells after Ag presentation and impaired cytotoxic activity. We also demonstrate that DNAM- 1-deficient T cells show reduced conjugations with tumor cells and decreased recruitment of both LFA-1 and lipid rafts to the immunological synapse, which correlates with reduced tumor cell killing in vitro. This synapse defect may explain why DNAM-1-deficient mice cannot clear tumors in vivo, and highlights the importance of DNAM-1 and the immunological synapse in T cell-mediated antitumor immunity.

Host interleukin (IL)-23 suppresses the immune response during tumor initiation, growth, and metastases, and neutralization of IL-23 causes IL-12-dependent antitumor effects. Here, we report that combining agonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to drive IL-12 production and anti-IL-23 mAbs to counter the tumor promoting effects of IL-23 has greater antitumor activity than either agent alone. This increased antitumor efficacy was observed in several experimental and spontaneous lung metastases models as well as in models of de novo carcinogenesis. The combination effects were dependent on host IL-12, perforin, IFNg, natural killer, and/or T cells and independent of host B cells and IFN-ab sensitivity. Interestingly, in the experimental lung metastases tumor models, we observed that intracellular IL-23 production was specifically restricted to MHC-II hiCD11c+CD11b+ cells. Furthermore, an increase in proportion of these IL-23-producing cells was detected only in tumor models where IL-23 neutralization was therapeutic.

NK cells lacking Aiolos were strongly hyper-reactive to a variety of NK-cell-mediated tumor models, yet impaired in controlling viral infection, suggesting a regulatory function for CD27- NK cells in balancing these two arms of the immune response. These data place Aiolos in the emerging gene regulatory network controlling NK-cell maturation and function. Synopsis Aiolos, a member of the Ikaros family of transcription factors, regulates the differentiation of mouse natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells constitutively express Aiolos. Aiolos is required for final stage of NK-cell development in the spleen. Aiolos acts independently of the known regulators of NK-cell maturation. Despite their impaired maturation, NK cells lacking Aiolos show enhanced ability to control tumors.

To perform such complicated tasks, NK cells express a wide set of inhibitory and activating receptors that alert them against cellular stress without damaging healthy cells. A new family of receptors that recognize nectin and nectin-like molecules has recently emerged as a critical regulator of NK cell functions. The most famous member of this family, DNAX accessory molecule (DNAM-1, CD226), is an adhesion molecule that control NK cell cytotoxicity and interferon-γ production against a wide range of cancer and infected cells. Its ligands CD112 and CD155 have been described in different pathological conditions, and recent evidence indicates that their expression is regulated by cellular stress. Additional receptors have been shown to bind DNAM-1 ligands and modulate NK cell functions bringing another level of complexity. These include CD96 (TACTILE) and TIGIT (WUCAM, VSTM3). Here, we review the role of DNAM-1, TIGIT and CD96 in NK cell biology summarizing the recent advances made on the role of these receptors in various pathologies, such as cancer, viral infections and autoimmunity. © 2014 Australasian Society for Immunology Inc.","inflammation; nectin; NK; receptor; tumour","antigen; cd155 antigen; cd96 antigen; cell adhesion molecule; DNAX accessory molecule 1; lymphocyte function associated antigen 1; natural killer cell receptor; nectin; nectin 2; protein; protein kinase C; unclassified drug; autoimmunity; dendritic cell; human; immunosurveillance; natural killer cell; neoplasm; review; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; T lymphocyte; virus infection; Animals; Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal; Humans; Killer Cells, Natural; Monitoring, Immunologic; Neoplasms"

The major extrinsic protection mechanism against cellular stress is the immune system. Indeed, it has been well described that cells that are stressed due to association with viral infection or early malignant transformation can be directly sensed by the immune system, particularly natural killer (NK) cells. Although the ability of NK cells to directly recognize and respond to stressed cells is well appreciated, the mechanisms and the breadth of cell-intrinsic responses that are intimately linked with their activation are only beginning to be uncovered. This review will provide a brief introduction to NK cells and the relevant receptors and ligands involved in direct responses to cellular stress. This will be followed by an in-depth discussion surrounding the various intrinsic responses to stress that can naturally engage NK cells, and how therapeutic agents may induce specific activation of NK cells and other innate immune cells by activating cellular responses to stress. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","cancer; cellular stress; immunogenic; NK cells; therapy","ATM protein; ATR protein; bortezomib; doxorubicin; heat shock protein 70; high mobility group B1 protein; initiation factor 4E; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; interleukin 15; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; melphalan; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; Myc protein; natural killer cell receptor NKG2D; adaptive immunity; carcinogenesis; cell activation; cell cycle arrest; cell cycle progression; cell death; cell surface; cell transformation; cellular stress response; cytokine release; cytotoxicity; DNA damage; DNA damage checkpoint; DNA polymorphism; gene inactivation; human; immunogenicity; immunosurveillance; innate immunity; liver cell carcinoma; major histocompatibility complex; malignant transformation; multiple myeloma; natural killer cell; nonhuman; priority journal; review; senescence; telomere shortening; tumor suppressor gene; Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Immune System; Killer Cells, Natural; Ligands; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; Oncogenes; Receptors, Natural Killer Cell; Stress, Physiological; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Virus Diseases"

Thephysiological purpose of such regulatory activity remains unclear, because it generally does not confera survival advantage. We found that NK cells specifically eliminated activated CD4+ Tcells in the salivary gland during chronic murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. This was dependent on TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression by NK cells. Although NK cell-mediated deletion of CD4+ Tcells prolonged the chronicity of infection, it also constrained viral-induced autoimmunity. In the absence of this activity, chronic infection was associated with a Sjogren's-like syndrome characterized by focal lymphocytic infiltration into the glands, production of autoantibodies, and reduced saliva and tear secretion. Thus, NK cells are an important homeostatic control that balances the efficacy of adaptive immune responses with the risk of developing autoimmunity. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,"autoantibody; cell surface marker; death receptor 5; natural killer cell receptor NKG2D; pilocarpine; Ro antibody; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; Klrk1 protein, mouse; natural killer cell lectin like receptor subfamily K; Tnfsf10 protein, mouse; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody blood level; antibody production; Article; autoimmunity; CD4+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; cytomegalovirus infection; flow cytometry; histopathology; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; lacrimation; limit of detection; lymphocytic infiltration; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; protein expression; salivary gland; salivation; T cell depletion; viral clearance; virus load; adoptive transfer; animal; apoptosis; autoimmunity; Bagg albino mouse; biosynthesis; CD4+ T lymphocyte; chronic disease; cytotoxicity; herpes virus infection; immunology; knockout mouse; Muromegalovirus; natural killer cell; pathology; transplantation; virology; Adoptive Transfer; Animals; Apoptosis; Autoimmunity; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Chronic Disease; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Herpesviridae Infections; Killer Cells, Natural; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Knockout; Muromegalovirus; NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K; Salivary Glands; TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand"

In contrast, the role of CD96, which shares the ligand CD155 with CD226 and TIGIT, has remained unclear.

During Listeria monocytogenes infection, we observed markedly reduced secretion of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1α) in livers of GrzM-deficient mice, which resulted in significantly impaired NK cell recruitment. Direct stimulation with IL-12 and IL-15 demonstrated that GrzM was required for maximal secretion of active MIP-1α. This effect was not due to reduced protein induction but resulted from heightened intracellular accumulation of MIP-1α, with reduced release.

Among these cytotoxins is granzyme B (GrB), a protease that has also been implicated in activation (restimulation)-induced cell death of natural killer (NK) and T cells, but the underlying mechanism and its regulation are unclear. Here we show that restimulation of previously activated human or mouse lymphocytes induces lysosomal membrane permeabilisation (LMP), followed by GrB release from LROs into the CL cytosol. The model lysosomal stressors sphingosine and Leu-Leu-methyl-ester, and CLs from gene-targeted mice were used to show that LMP releases GrB in both a time-and concentration-dependent manner, and that the liberated GrB is responsible for cell death. The endogenous GrB inhibitor Serpinb9 (Sb9) protects CLs against LMP-induced death but is decreasingly effective as the extent of LMP increases. We also used these model stressors to show that GrB is the major effector of LMP-mediated death in T cells, but that in NK cells additional effectors are released, making GrB redundant. We found that limited LMP and GrB release occurs constitutively in proliferating lymphocytes and in NK cells engaged with targets in vitro. In Ectromelia virus-infected lymph nodes, working NK cells lacking Sb9 are more susceptible to GrB-mediated death. Taken together, these data show that a basal level of LMP occurs in proliferating and activated lymphocytes, and is increased on restimulation. LMP releases GrB from LROs into the lymphocyte cytoplasm and its ensuing interaction with Sb9 dictates whether or not the cell survives. The GrB-Sb9 nexus may therefore represent an additional mechanism of limiting lymphocyte lifespan and populations. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","activation-induced cell death; cytotoxic lymphocytes; granzyme B; lysosomal membrane permeabilisation; Serpinb9","activation induced cytidine deaminase; granzyme B; serine proteinase inhibitor; serpinb9; unclassified drug; granzyme; serine proteinase inhibitor; SERPINB9 protein, human; sphingosine; animal cell; article; cell death; cell fate; cell stress; cell survival; controlled study; cytoplasm; cytosol; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; Ectromelia virus; enzyme release; experimental model; gene targeting; human; human cell; in vitro study; lymph node; lymphocyte; lymphocyte proliferation; lysosomal stress; lysosome; lysosome membrane; membrane permeability; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; normal human; priority journal; protein function; protein protein interaction; T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; animal; cell membrane permeability; cytology; drug effects; genetics; lymphocyte; lysosome; metabolism; pathology; physiological stress; Ectromelia virus; Mus; Animals; Cell Death; Cell Membrane Permeability; Granzymes; Humans; Killer Cells, Natural; Lymphocytes; Lysosomes; Mice; Serpins; Sphingosine; Stress, Physiological; T-Lymphocytes"

The few genetic studies that have been conducted in Chernobyl generally show elevated rates of genetic damage and mutation rates. All major taxonomic groups investigated (i.e., birds, bees, butterflies, grasshoppers, dragonflies, spiders, mammals) displayed reduced population sizes in highly radioactive parts of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. In Fukushima, population censuses of birds, butterflies, and cicadas suggested that abundances were negatively impacted by exposure to radioactive contaminants, while other groups (e.g., dragonflies, grasshoppers, bees, spiders) showed no significant declines, at least during the first summer following the disaster. Insufficient information exists for groups other than insects and birds to assess effects on life history at this time. The differences observed between Fukushima and Chernobyl may reflect the different times of exposure and the significance of multigenerational mutation accumulation in Chernobyl compared to Fukushima. There was considerable variation among taxa in their apparent sensitivity to radiation and this reflects in part life history, physiology, behavior, and evolutionary history. Interestingly, for birds, population declines in Chernobyl can be predicted by historical mitochondrial DNA base-pair substitution rates that may reflect intrinsic DNA repair ability. © The American Genetic Association 2014.

Conservation practitioners are attempting to prevent further declines and loss of biodiversity as well as to facilitate recovery of endangered species, and they often rely on interdisciplinary approaches to generate conservation solutions. Two recent interfaces in conservation science involve animal behavior (i.e., conservation behavior) and physiology (i.e., conservation physiology). To date, these interfaces have been considered separate entities, but from both pragmatic and biological perspectives, there is merit in better integrating behavior and physiology to address applied conservation problems and to inform resource management. Although there are some institutional, conceptual, methodological, and communication-oriented challenges to integrating behavior and physiology to inform conservation actions, most of these barriers can be overcome. Through outlining several successful examples that integrate these disciplines, we conclude that physiology and behavior can together generate meaningful data to support animal conservation and management actions. Tangentially, applied conservation and management problems can, in turn, also help advance and reinvigorate the fundamental disciplines of animal physiology and behavior by providing advanced natural experiments that challenge traditional frameworks. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

Using biotelemetry, blood physiology, and reflex assessments, we evaluated the relative roles of gill net injury and air exposure and investigated whether using a recovery box improved survival. Fish (n p 238), captured by beach seine, were allocated to four treatment groups: captured only, air exposed, injured, and injured and air exposed. Only half of the fish in each group were provided with a 15-min facilitated recovery. After treatment, fish were radio-tagged and released to resume their migration. Blood status was assessed in 36 additional untagged fish sampled after the four treatments. Compared with fish sampled immediately on capture, all treatments resulted in elevated plasma lactate and cortisol concentrations. After air exposure, plasma osmolality was elevated and reflexes were significantly impaired relative to the control and injured treatments. Injured fish exhibited reduced short-term migration speed by 3.2 km/d and had a 14.5% reduced survival to subnatal watersheds compared to controls. The 15-min facilitated recovery improved reflex assessment relative to fish released immediately but did not affect survival. We suggest that in sockeye salmon migrating in cool water temperatures (~13°-16° C), delayed mortality can result from injury and air exposure, perhaps through sublethal stress, and that injury created additive delayed mortality likely via secondary infections. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

The Vianney-Legendre vertical slot fishway on the Richelieu River, Quebec, Canada, passes large numbers of migrating redhorse (Moxostoma spp.) upriver to spawning grounds each year. We evaluated the physiological capacity and relative swimming ability of three redhorse species (Moxostoma anisurum, Moxostoma carinatum, Moxostoma macrolepidotum; silver, river, and shorthead redhorse, respectively) to determine how these biotic factors relate to variation in fishway passage success and duration. Shorthead redhorse had higher maximum metabolic rates and were faster swimmers than silver and river redhorse at their species-specific peak migration temperatures. Blood lactate and glucose concentrations recovered more quickly for river redhorse than for silver and shorthead redhorse, and river redhorse placed second in terms of metabolic recovery and swim speed. Interestingly, fish sampled from the top of the fishway had nearly identical lactate, glucose, and pH values compared to control fish. Using passive integrated transponders in 2010 and 2012, we observed that passage success and duration were highly variable among redhorse species and were not consistent among years, suggesting that other factors such as water temperature and river flows may modulate passage success. Clearly, additional research is needed to understand how organismal performance, environmental conditions, and other factors (including abundance of conspecifics and other comigrants) interact with fishway features to dictate which fish will be successful and to inform research of future fishways. Our research suggests that there may be an opportunity for a rapid assessment approach where fish chased to exhaustion to determine maximal values of physiological disturbance are compared to fish sampled from the top of the fishway, which could reveal which species (or sizes of fish) are approaching or exceeding their physiological capacity during passage. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

Despite being released, these fish may experience high mortality while they traverse the water column to locate suitable refuge to avoid predators, all the while recovering from the stress of capture. The predatory reef fish Spanish flag snapper (Lutjanus carponotatus) is frequently released because of a minimum-size or bag limit or by fishers targeting more desirable species. Using L. carponotatus as a model, we tested whether simulated fishing stress (exercise and air exposure) resulted in impairments in reflexes (e.g., response to stimuli) and the ability to identify and use refuge in a laboratory arena and whether any impairments were associated with blood physiology or metabolic recovery. Control fish were consistently responsive to reflex tests and rapidly located and entered refugia in the arena within seconds. Conversely, treatment fish (exhausted and air exposed) were unresponsive to stimuli, took longer to search for refugia, and were more apprehensive to enter the refuge once it was located. Consequently, treatment fish took more than 70 times longer than control fish to enter the coral refuge (26.12 vs. 0.36 min, respectively). The finding that fish exposed to stress were hesitant to use refugia suggests that there was likely cognitive, visual, and/or physiological impairment. Blood lactate, glucose, and hematocrit measures were perturbed at 15 and 30 min after the stressor, relative to controls. However, measurements of oxygen consumption rate revealed that about 50% of metabolic recovery occurred within 30 min after the stressor, coinciding with apparent cognitive/ visual/physiological recovery. Recovering the treatment fish in aerated, flow-through chambers for 30 min before introduction to the behavioral arena restored reflexes, and ""recovered"" fish behaved more similarly to controls. Therefore, we suggest that temporarily holding coral reef fish that have undergone an exhaustive fishing interaction and an air exposure episode should enable significant recovery of cognitive and metabolic attributes that would enable fish to more rapidly locate and utilize refugia to avoid postrelease predation. However, after nonexhaustive fishing interactions (i.e., minimal reflex impairment), it is likely that immediate release would be most beneficial. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

Impairment of T cell control results in rapid development of DLBCL-like disease, which can be eradicated by polyclonal CD8 + T cells in a T cell receptor-, CD28- and Fas ligand-dependent manner. Thus, malignant transformation of mature B cells requires mutations that impair intrinsic differentiation processes and permit escape from T cell-mediated tumor surveillance. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.",,"B lymphocyte induced maturation protein 1; CD28 antigen; Fas ligand; protein bcl 6; T lymphocyte receptor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; B cell lymphoma; Blimp1 gene; cancer control; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; down regulation; gene; gene deletion; gene mutation; gene overexpression; immunosurveillance; lymphoma cell; malignant transformation; molecular mechanics; mouse; mutant; nonhuman; priority journal; protein deficiency; transgene; Mus; Animals; B-Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell Separation; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Disease Models, Animal; DNA-Binding Proteins; Fas Ligand Protein; Flow Cytometry; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Immunologic Surveillance; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Mutation; T-Lymphocytes; Transcription Factors"

Flight initiation distance (FID) potentially constitutes a general proximate factor influencing such trade-offs reflecting the risks that individuals take. Therefore, greater investment in reproduction occurs at a higher risk of death, resulting in selection for efficient flight morphology. I analysed long-term data on FID in a population of barn swallows Hirundo rustica during 1984-2013 with 2196 records of FID for 1789 individuals. FID had a repeatability of 0.62 (SE = 0.04) and a heritability of 0.48 (SE = 0.07). FID varied between individuals and sites, and it increased over time as climate ameliorated. FID showed a U-shaped relationship with age, with young and very old individuals having the longest FIDs. Barn swallows that arrived early from spring migration, started to breed early and produced many fledglings had the longest FID. Individuals with the longest tails had the longest FID, and individuals with the shortest aspect ratios and wing loadings had the longest FID. Individuals that died from predation had shorter FID than survivors. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that FID relates directly to life history, with longer FIDs being associated with smaller levels of risk-taking. © 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.","Aspect ratio; Flight initiation distance; Heritability; Predation; Repeatability; Selection; Wing loading","bird; body shape; flight activity; life history; migratory population; population genetics; predation; reproductive cost; seasonal variation; animal; animal behavior; female; flying; high risk behavior; male; physiology; population dynamics; population migration; predation; season; sexual behavior; swallow (bird); Animal Migration; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Female; Flight, Animal; Male; Population Dynamics; Predatory Behavior; Risk-Taking; Seasons; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Swallows"

Despite relatively well-characterized in vivo physiological modulations in response to aquatic pollutants, the molecular mechanisms due to toxicity and detoxification are still unclear. To better understand the mechanisms of metal transport and further detoxification, T. japonicus P-glycoprotein (TJ-P-gp) with conserved motifs/domains was cloned and measured for protein activity against the transcript and protein expression profiles in response to metal exposure. Specifically, we characterized the preliminary efflux activity and membrane topology of TJ-P-gp protein that supports a transport function for chemicals. To uncover whether the efflux activity of TJ-P-gp protein would be modulated by metal treatment, copepods were exposed to three metals (Cd, Cu, and Zn), and were observed for both dose- and time-dependency on the efflux activity of TJ-P-gp protein with or without 10. μM of P-gp-specific inhibitors verapamil and zosuquidar (LY335979) for 24. h over a wide range of metal concentrations. In particular, treatment with zosuquidar induced metal accumulation in the inner body of T. japonicus. In addition, three metals significantly induced the transporting activity of TJ-P-gp in a concentration-dependent manner in both transcript and protein levels within 24. h. Together these data indicate that T. japonicus has a conserved P-gp-mediated metal defense system through the induction of transcriptional up-regulation of TJ-P-gp gene and TJ-P-gp protein activity. This finding provides further understanding of the molecular defense mechanisms involved in P-glycoprotein-mediated metal detoxification in copepods. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Copepod; Metal; P-glycoprotein; Pollution; Tigriopus japonicus","cadmium; complementary DNA; copper; multidrug resistance protein; verapamil; zinc; zosuquidar; metal; multidrug resistance protein; water pollutant; cadmium; copper; metal; multidrug resistance protein; verapamil; zinc; zosuquidar; crustacean; detoxification; ecotoxicology; heavy metal; inhibitor; marine pollution; protein; remediation; toxicity; bioremediation; intertidal community; physiological response; water pollution; 3' untranslated region; 5' untranslated region; animal experiment; animal model; article; clone; computer model; concentration response; controlled study; copepod; detoxification; DNA sequence; dose response; drug activity; drug blood level; ecosystem restoration; effusion; genetic transcription; heavy metal poisoning; in vivo study; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; P gp gene; phylogeny; pollution transport; priority journal; protein domain; protein expression; protein function; protein motif; sequence analysis; Tigriopus japonicus; upregulation; animal; chemistry; copepod; drug inactivation; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; promoter region; water pollutant; adult; Article; bioremediation; concentration (parameters); intertidal species; molecular cloning; molecular mechanics; protein localization; protein transport; Animals; Copepoda; Gene Expression Regulation; Inactivation, Metabolic; Metals; P-Glycoprotein; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Up-Regulation; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Copepoda; Tigriopus japonicus"

The promoter region of Km-clock had 1 aryl hydrocarbon receptor element (AhRE, GTGCGTGACA) and 8 estrogen receptor (ER) half-sites, indicating that the AhRE and ER half sites would likely be associated with regulation of clock protein activity during EDCs-induced cellular stress. The Km-clock protein domains (bHLH, PAS1, PAS2) were highly conserved in five additional fish species (zebrafish, Japanese medaka, Southern platyfish, Nile tilapia, and spotted green pufferfish), suggesting that the fish clock protein may play an important role in controlling endogenous circadian rhythms. The promoter regions of Km-BMAL1, -Cry1, -Cry2, and -Per2 were found to contain several xenobiotic response elements (XREs), indicating that EDCs may be able to alter the expression of these genes. To analyze the endogenous circadian rhythm in K. marmoratus, we measured expression of Km-clock and other circadian rhythmic genes (e.g. Per2, Cry1, Cry2, and BMAL1) in different tissues, and found ubiquitous expression, although there were different patterns of transcript amplification during different developmental stages. In an estrogen (E2)-exposed group, Km-clock expression was down-regulated, however, a hydroxytamoxifen (TMX, nonsteroid estrogen antagonist)-exposed group showed an upregulated pattern of Km-clock expression, suggesting that the expression of Km-clock is closely associated with exposure to EDCs. In response to the exposure of bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-tert-octyphenol (OP), Km-clock expression was down-regulated in the pituitary/brain, muscle, and skin in both gender types (hermaphrodite and secondary male). In juvenile K. marmoratus liver tissue, expression of Km-clock and other circadian rhythmic pathway-associated genes showed a regular oscillation pattern over a period of approximately 24 h during a 12L:12D cycle. However, the circadian rhythm of BPA-exposed juvenile K. marmoratus liver tissue was perturbed over a 12L:12D period.

To aid in their management and protection, we outline nine key principles for supporting healthy and productive ecosystems based on the best available science, including laws of physics and chemistry apply to ecology; population dynamics are regulated by reproduction, mortality, and growth; habitat quantity and quality are prerequisites of fish productivity; connectivity among habitats is essential for movements of fishes and their resources; freshwater species and their habitats are tightly linked to surrounding watersheds; biodiversity can enhance ecosystem resiliency and productivity; global processes affect local populations; anthropogenic stressors have cumulative effects; and evolutionary processes can be important. Based on these principles, we provide general recommendations for managing and protecting freshwater ecosystems and the fisheries they support, with examples of successful implementation for each strategy. Key management strategies include engage and consult with stakeholders; ensure that agencies have sufficient capacity, legislation, and authority to implement policies and management plans; define metrics by which fisheries resources and management success or failure will be measured; identify and account for threats to ecosystem productivity; adopt the precautionary approach to management; embrace adaptive management; implement ecosystem-based management; account for all ecosystem services provided by aquatic ecosystems; protect and restore habitat as the foundation for fisheries; and protect biodiversity.

Signaling theory predicts that individuals of superior phenotypic quality will enjoy an advantage in term of mating success, but also in term of natural selection, if such individuals are in prime condition both before and after development of exaggerated secondary sexual characters. We tested this prediction in the Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica being preyed upon by the Eurasian Sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus, using extensive samples of feathers from prey and non-prey. We measured tail length and coloration of outermost tail feathers in the black area of the proximal and distal part of tail feathers, but also the white spot of the tail feathers. Prey had significantly less dark distal, but not proximal parts of their tails, while there was no difference in coloration of the white spot between prey and non-prey. Prey had significantly paler tail feathers than non-prey, especially among long-tailed individuals. These results suggest that Barn Swallows with long tails that fail to deposit large amounts of melanin in their tail feathers run an elevated risk of predation.","coloration; ornaments; predation; sexual selection; signals; Sparrowhawk","color; melanin; natural selection; passerine; predation risk; reproductive success; sexual selection; signal; signaling"

The accumulated metal contents and expressions of 3 SOD genes were compared after exposure to single and combinations of heavy metals, As, Ni, and Pb. The deduced amino acid sequences of the 3 SODs had evolutionary conserved domains, such as metal binding sites, and signature sequences. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that Cu/Zn-SOD1, Cu/Zn-SOD2, and Mn-SOD were clustered with extracellular Cu/Zn-SOD, intracellular Cu/Zn-SOD and mitochondrial Mn-SOD, respectively, of other species. The accumulated contents of Ni and Pb increased significantly in a time - dependent manner after exposure to both single and combination of the metals. However, the concentration of As did not change significantly in the exposure test. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array showed that the 3 SOD genes had differential expression patterns depending on the exposure condition. The expression of all SODs mRNAs was significantly elevated in response to Pb alone and in combination with As. The mRNA level of Cu/Zn-SOD1 was the highest after exposure to Pb alone, while that of Mn-SOD was remarkably enhanced after exposure to a combination of As and Pb. Exposure to Ni alone rapidly elevated the expression of Cu/Zn-SOD1 and Mn-SOD mRNA, which then gradually decreased. Exposure to As had no significant effect on the modulation of any of the SOD genes of P. nuntia. These results suggest that all SOD genes might play important roles in cellular protection as antioxidant enzymes against heavy metal toxicity via different modes of action in P. nuntia and might have the potential to act as indicators in an environment containing a mixture of metals. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Biomarker; Heavy metal; Polychaete Perinereis nuntia; Superoxide dismutase (SOD)","arsenic; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; copper zinc superoxide dismutase 1; copper zinc superoxide dismutase 2; heavy metal; lead; manganese superoxide dismutase; messenger RNA; nickel; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; antioxidant; biological marker; heavy metal; messenger RNA; metal; superoxide dismutase; bioaccumulation; bioindicator; biomarker; enzyme; gene expression; heavy metal; polychaete; toxicity; amino acid sequence; animal experiment; article; bioaccumulation; Cu Zn SOD1 gene; Cu Zn SOD2 gene; gene expression; Mn SOD gene; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Perinereis nuntia; phylogeny; Polychaeta; real time polymerase chain reaction; sea pollution; analysis; animal; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; enzymology; genetics; intoxication; metabolism; mitochondrion; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; Polychaeta; sea; water pollution; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Antioxidants; Base Sequence; Biological Markers; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Metals; Metals, Heavy; Mitochondria; Molecular Sequence Data; Oceans and Seas; Phylogeny; Poisoning; Polychaeta; RNA, Messenger; Superoxide Dismutase; Water Pollution, Chemical"

After UV radiation, the survival rate of P. nana was significantly reduced. Also, egg sac damage and a reduction in the hatching rate of offspring were observed in UV-irradiated ovigerous females. According to the assessed biochemical parameters, we found dose-dependent increases in ROS levels and high levels of the lipid peroxidation decomposition product by 2 kJ m- 2, implying that P. nana was under off-balanced status by oxidative stress-mediated cellular damage. Antioxidant enzyme activities of GST and SOD increased over different doses of UV radiation. To measure UV-induced lipid peroxidation, we found a slight reduction in the composition of essential fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These findings indicate that UV radiation can induce oxidative stress-triggered lipid peroxidation with modulation of antioxidant enzyme activity, leading to a significant effect on mortality and reproductive physiology (e.g. fecundity).

Nests are mainly constructed prior to egg laying, meaning that parent birds must make decisions about nest site choice and nest building behavior before the start of egg-laying. Parent birds should be selected to choose nest sites and to build optimally sized nests, yet our current understanding of clutch size-nest size relationships is limited to small-scale studies performed over short time periods. Here, we quantified the relationship between clutch size and nest size, using an exhaustive database of 116 slope estimates based on 17,472 nests of 21 species of hole and non-hole-nesting birds. There was a significant, positive relationship between clutch size and the base area of the nest box or the nest, and this relationship did not differ significantly between open nesting and hole-nesting species. The slope of the relationship showed significant intraspecific and interspecific heterogeneity among four species of secondary hole-nesting species, but also among all 116 slope estimates. The estimated relationship between clutch size and nest box base area in study sites with more than a single size of nest box was not significantly different from the relationship using studies with only a single size of nest box. The slope of the relationship between clutch size and nest base area in different species of birds was significantly negatively related to minimum base area, and less so to maximum base area in a given study. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that bird species have a general reaction norm reflecting the relationship between nest size and clutch size. Further, they suggest that scientists may influence the clutch size decisions of hole-nesting birds through the provisioning of nest boxes of varying sizes. © 2014 The Authors.","Hole nesting; Natural holes; Nest boxes; Reaction norm","Aves"

Many immunotherapeutic regimens are now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for use in cancer patients, and many others are being investigated as standalone therapeutic interventions or combined with conventional treatments in clinical studies. Immunotherapies may be subdivided into ""passive"" and ""active"" based on their ability to engage the host immune system against cancer. Since the anticancer activity of most passive immunotherapeutics (including tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies) also relies on the host immune system, this classification does not properly reflect the complexity of the drug-host-tumor interaction. Alternatively, anticancer immunotherapeutics can be classified according to their antigen specificity.

However, little is known about their toxicity to marine organisms. This study comprehensively investigated the molecular, individual and population responses of the marine copepod, Tigriopus japonicus upon waterborne exposure to TPT chloride (TPTCl). Our results indicated that TPTCl was highly toxic to adult T. japonicus, with a 96-h LC50 concentration at 6.3 μg/L. As shown in a chronic full life-cycle test, T. japonicus exposed to 1.0 μg/L TPTCl exhibited a delay in development and a significant reduction of population growth, in terms of the intrinsic rate of increase (rm). Based on the negative relationship between the rm and exposure concentration, a critical effect concentration was estimated at 1.6 μg/L TPTCl; at or above which population extinction could occur. At 0.1 μg/L TPTCl or above, the sex ratio of the second generation of the copepod was significantly altered and changed to a male-biased population. At molecular level, the inhibition of the transcriptional expression of glutathione S-transferase related genes might lead to dysfunction of detoxification, and the inhibition of retinoid X receptor mRNA expression implied an interruption of the growth and moulting process in T. japonicus. As the only gene that observed up-regulated in this study, the expression of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) increased in a concentration- dependent manner, indicating its function in protecting the copepod from TPT-mediated oxidative stress. The study advances our understanding on the ecotoxicity of TPT, and provides some initial data on its toxic mechanisms in small crustaceans like copepods. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.","Intrinsic rate of increase; Organotin; Oxidative stress; Sex ratio","glutathione transferase; heat shock protein 70; messenger RNA; retinoid X receptor; triphenyltin chloride; organotin compound; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcriptome; triphenyltin; water pollutant; coastal zone; concentration (composition); crustacean; gene expression; growth response; marine environment; organotin compound; pollution effect; pollution exposure; population growth; sex ratio; toxicity; adult; article; chronic toxicity; concentration response; controlled study; copepod; detoxification; developmental disorder; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; female; gene expression regulation; growth regulation; LC 50; life cycle stage; male; marine species; molting; nonhuman; oxidative stress; population growth; priority journal; sex ratio; Tigriopus japonicus; transcription regulation; upregulation; animal; copepod; drug effects; metabolism; toxicity; toxicity testing; water pollutant; Asia; Copepoda; Crustacea; Tigriopus japonicus; Animals; Copepoda; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Life Cycle Stages; Male; Organotin Compounds; Reactive Oxygen Species; Sex Ratio; Toxicity Tests, Acute; Toxicity Tests, Chronic; Transcriptome; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

However, the effect of heavy metals on zooplankton at the molecular level remains still unclear. In this study, we measured the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and the antioxidant enzyme activities for 96 h after exposure to five heavy metals: arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), and zinc (Zn) in the intertidal copepod Tigriopus japonicus. Activities of the antioxidant enzymes were highly elevated in metal-exposed copepods, indicating that heavy metals can induce oxidative stress by generating ROS, and stimulate the involvement of antioxidant enzymes as cellular defense mechanisms. Subsequently, transcriptional changes in hsp gene families were further investigated in the metal-exposed groups for 96 h. The ROS level and glutathione (GSH) content were significantly increased in Ag-, As-, and Cu-exposed copepods, while they were only slightly elevated in Cd- and Zn-exposed groups. Based on the numbers of significantly modulated hsp genes and their expression levels for 96 h, we measured the effect of heavy metals to stress genes of T. japonicus in the following order: Cu > Zn > Ag > As > Cd, implying that Cu acts as a stronger oxidative stress inducer than other heavy metals. Of them, the expression of hsp20 and hsp70 genes was substantially modulated by exposure to heavy metals, indicating that these genes would provide a sensitive molecular biomarker for aquatic monitoring of heavy metal pollution. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Antioxidant enzyme activities; Copepod; Heat shock protein; Heavy metal; Oxidative stress; Tigriopus japonicus","arsenic; cadmium; complementary DNA; copper; glutathione; heat shock protein; heat shock protein 20; heat shock protein 70; reactive oxygen metabolite; silver; zinc; arthropod protein; biological marker; heavy metal; oxidoreductase; water pollutant; article; controlled study; copepod; defense mechanism; DNA synthesis; enzyme activity; gene expression; multigene family; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; Tigriopus japonicus; administration and dosage; adverse effects; agonists; animal; aquaculture; chemistry; comparative study; copepod; dose response; drug effects; environmental exposure; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; male; metabolism; oxidative stress; South Korea; toxicity; toxicity testing; water pollutant; Animals; Aquaculture; Arthropod Proteins; Biological Markers; Copepoda; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Environmental Exposure; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Glutathione; HSP20 Heat-Shock Proteins; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Male; Metals, Heavy; Oxidative Stress; Oxidoreductases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Republic of Korea; Toxicity Tests, Acute; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Nest defenses as frontline may block or promote the subsequent stage of defenses such as egg recognition. We conducted comparative studies of the defensive strategies of a host of the Oriental cuckoo Cuculus optatus, the yellow-bellied prinia Prinia flaviventris, in mainland China with multiple species of cuckoos and in Taiwan with a single cuckoo species. Cuckoo hosts did not exhibit aggression toward cuckoos in the presence of multiple cuckoo species but showed strong aggressive defenses of hosts directed toward cuckoos in Taiwan. Furthermore, the cuckoo host in populations with a single cuckoo species was able to distinguish adults of its brood parasite, the Oriental cuckoo, from adult common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus). This represents the first case in which a cuckoo host has been shown to specifically distinguish Oriental cuckoo, from other Cuculus species. Hosts ejected eggs at a higher rate in a single cuckoo species system than in a multi-species cuckoo system, which supports the strategy facilitation hypothesis. Granularity analysis of variation in egg phenotype based on avian vision modeling supported the egg signature hypothesis in hosts because Taiwanese prinias increased consistency in the appearance of their eggs within individual hosts thus favoring efficient discrimination against cuckoo eggs.

DMdomains of the proteins encoded by the B.koreanus Dmrt (Bk-Dmrt) genes had high similarities to DM domains of other invertebrate species. To understand the potential effects of environmental stressors on the transcriptional expression of Dmrt genes in rotifers, we exposed B.koreanus to a wide range of UV-B radiation and different concentrations of benzo[. a]pyrene (B[. a]P) over different time courses. Transcript levels of all Bk-Dmrt genes decreased significantly in response to relatively high doses of UV-B irradiation, and were also downregulated in response to exposure to UV-B radiation over time. Transcript levels of all Bk-Dmrt genes were downregulated in response to B[. a]P exposure for 24. h. This decrease in expression of all Bk-Dmrt genes was concomitant with the growth retardation induced by UV-B and B[. a]P exposure. We concluded that both environmental stressors have detrimental effects on transcriptional regulation of all Bk-Dmrt genes, especially relatively high doses of these stressors, leading to growth retardation.

Using acoustic accelerometer transmitters, we estimated the anaerobic activity of anadromous adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in the tailrace of a diversion dam in British Columbia, Canada, and its effects on the remaining 50 km of their freshwater spawning migration. Consistent with our hypothesis, migrants that elicited burst swimming behaviors in high flows were more likely to succumb to mortality following dam passage. Females swam with more anaerobic effort compared to males, providing a mechanism for the female-biased migration mortality observed in this watershed. Alterations to dam operations prevented the release of hypolimnetic water from an upstream lake, exposing some migrants to supraoptimal, nearlethal water temperatures (i.e., 24ºC) that inhibited their ability to locate, enter, and ascend a vertical-slot fishway. Findings from this study have shown delayed post-dam passage survival consequences of high-flow-induced burst swimming in sockeye salmon.

We analysed extensive data on temporal change in laying date and clutch size of birds from Europe and North America to test whether these changes were related to recent trends in population size. Across studies, laying date advanced significantly, while clutch size did not change. However, within populations, changes in laying date and clutch size were positively correlated, implying that species which advanced their laying date the most were also those that increased their clutch size the most. Greater advances in laying date were associated with species that had multiple broods per season, lived in nonagricultural habitats and were herbivorous or predatory. The duration of the breeding season increased for multibrooded species and decreased for single-brooded species. Changes in laying date and clutch size were not related to changes in population size (for resident or migratory species). This suggests that, across a wide variety of species, mismatches in the timing of egg laying or numbers of offspring have had relatively little influence on population size compared with other aspects of phenology and life history. © 2013 British Ecological Society.","Birds; Climate change; Duration of breeding season; Migration; Mismatch hypothesis; Population trends","Aves; animal; biological model; bird; climate change; Europe; physiology; population density; population migration; reproduction; season; Animal Migration; Animals; Birds; Climate Change; Europe; Models, Biological; Population Density; Reproduction; Seasons"

Furthermore, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the toxic effects of WAF on this benthic organism by studying expression patterns of cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes. Development of T. japonicus was delayed and molting was interrupted in response to WAF exposure. Hatching rate was also significantly reduced in response to WAF exposure. Activities of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), and catalase (CAT) were increased by WAF exposure in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicated that WAF exposure resulted in oxidative stress, which in turn was associated with dysfunctional development and reproduction. To evaluate the involvement of cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes, we cloned the entire repertoire of CYP genes in T. japonicus (n= 52) and found that the CYP genes belonged to five different clans (i.e., Clans 2, 3, 4, mitochondrial, and 20). We then examined expression patterns of these 52 CYP genes in response to WAF exposure.

Given the differences in species composition and environmental attributes between tropical and temperate saltwater ecosystems, there are conceivable uncertainties in such 'temperate-to-tropic' extrapolations. This study aims to compare temperate and tropical saltwater species' acute sensitivity to 11 chemicals through a comprehensive meta-analysis, by comparing species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) between the two groups. A 10 percentile hazardous concentration (HC10) is derived from each SSD, and then a temperate-to-tropic HC10 ratio is computed for each chemical. Our results demonstrate that temperate and tropical saltwater species display significantly different sensitivity towards all test chemicals except cadmium, although such differences are small with the HC10 ratios ranging from 0.094 (un-ionised ammonia) to 2.190 (pentachlorophenol) only. Temperate species are more sensitive to un-ionised ammonia, chromium, lead, nickel and tributyltin, whereas tropical species are more sensitive to copper, mercury, zinc, phenol and pentachlorophenol. Through comparison of a limited number of taxon-specific SSDs, we observe that there is a general decline in chemical sensitivity from algae to crustaceans, molluscs and then fishes.

Although a large set of transcriptomic data was recently assembled for several species of crustaceans, identification and annotation of the large ABC transporter gene family have been very challenging. Results: In the intertidal copepod Tigriopus japonicus, 46 putative ABC transporters were identified using in silico analysis, and their full-length cDNA sequences were characterized. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 46 T. japonicus ABC transporters are classified into eight subfamilies (A-H) that include all the members of all ABC subfamilies, consisting of five ABCA, five ABCB, 17 ABCC, three ABCD, one ABCE, three ABCF, seven ABCG, and five ABCH subfamilies. Of them, unique isotypic expansion of two clades of ABCC1 proteins was observed. Real-time RT-PCR-based heatmap analysis revealed that most T. japonicus ABC genes showed temporal transcriptional expression during copepod development. The overall transcriptional profile demonstrated that half of all T. japonicus ABC genes were strongly associated with at least one developmental stage. Of them, transcripts TJ-ABCH_88708 and TJ-ABCE1 were highly expressed during all developmental stages. Conclusions: The whole set of T. japonicus ABC genes and their phylogenetic relationships will provide a better understanding of the comparative evolution of essential gene family resources in arthropods, including the crustacean copepods. © 2014 Jeong et al.","ATP-binding cassette transporter; Copepod; Development; Genome; Tigriopus japonicus","ABC transporter; animal; classification; copepod; gene expression profiling; genetics; genomics; growth, development and aging; molecular genetics; phylogeny; Animals; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters; Copepoda; Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Phylogeny"

Mortality estimates from these research efforts can be incorporated into management models to ensure the sustainability of fisheries and the conservation of threatened species. Post-release mortality estimates are typically made by holding the catch in a tank, pen or cage for short-term monitoring (e.g. 48 h). These estimates may be inaccurate in some cases because they fail to integrate the challenges of the wild environment. Most obvious among these challenges is predator evasion. Stress and injury from a capture experience can temporarily impair physiological capacity and alter behaviour in released animals, a period during which predation risk is likely elevated. In large-scale commercial fisheries, predators have adapted their behaviour to capitalize on impaired fishes being discarded, while in recreational catch-and-release fisheries, exercise and air exposure can similarly impede the capacity for released fish to evade opportunistic predators. Owing to the indirect and often cryptic nature of this source of mortality, very few studies have attempted to document it. A survey of the literature demonstrated that <2% of the papers in the combined realms of bycatch and catch-and-release have directly addressed or considered post-release predation. Future research should combine field telemetry and laboratory studies using both natural and simulated predation encounters and incorporate physiological and behavioural endpoints. Quite simply, predation is an understudied and underappreciated contributor to the mortality of animals released from fishing gears. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Bycatch; Discards; Fish behaviour; Fish impairment; Unobserved mortality","bycatch; fishery management; fishing gear; mortality; species conservation; sustainable development; Animalia; Pisces"

Microparasites selected for enhanced virulence in culture settings should be less successful maintaining infectivity in wild populations, as once the host dies, there are limited opportunities to infect new individuals. Instead, moderately virulent microparasites persisting for long periods across multiple environments are of greatest concern. Evolved resistance to endemic microparasites may reduce susceptibilities, but as barriers to microparasite distributions are weakened, and environments become more stressful, unexposed populations may be impacted and pathogenicity enhanced. We provide an overview of the evolutionary and ecological impacts of infectious diseases in wild salmon and suggest ways in which modern technologies can elucidate the microparasites of greatest potential import. We present four case studies that resolve microparasite impacts on adult salmon migration success, impact of river warming on microparasite replication, and infection status on susceptibility to predation. Future health of wild salmon must be considered in a holistic context that includes the cumulative or synergistic impacts of multiple stressors. These approaches will identify populations at greatest risk, critically needed to manage and potentially ameliorate the shifts in current or future trajectories of wild populations. © 2014 The Authors.

However, the role of radioadaptive responses in wild populations remains poorly known. At Chernobyl, studies of birds and other taxa including humans show that chronic exposure to radiation depletes antioxidants and increases oxidative damage. Here, we present analyses of levels of the most important intracellular antioxidant (i.e. glutathione, GSH), its redox status, DNA damage and body condition in 16 species of birds exposed to radiation at Chernobyl. We use an approach that allows considering the individual bird as the sampling unit while controlling for phylogenetic effects, thus increasing the statistical power by avoiding the use of species means as done for most previous comparative studies. As a consequence, we found a pattern radically different from previous studies in wild populations, showing that GSH levels and body condition increased, and oxidative stress and DNA damage decreased, with increasing background radiation. Thus, when several species are considered, the overall pattern indicates that birds are not negatively affected by chronic exposure to radiation and may even obtain beneficial hormetic effects following an adaptive response. Analysis of the phylogenetic signal supports the existence of adaptation in the studied traits, particularly in GSH levels and DNA damage. We also show that, under equal levels of radiation, the birds that produce larger amounts of the pigment pheomelanin and lower amounts of eumelanin pay a cost in terms of decreased GSH levels, increased oxidative stress and DNA damage, and poorer body condition. Radiation, however, diminished another potential cost of pheomelanin, namely its tendency to produce free radicals when exposed to radiation, because it induced a change towards the production of less pro-oxidant forms of pheomelanin with higher benzothiazole-to-benzothiazine ratios, which may have facilitated the acclimation of birds to radiation exposure. Our findings represent the first evidence of adaptation to ionizing radiation in wild animals, and confirm that pheomelanin synthesis represents an evolutionary constraint under stressful environmental conditions because it requires GSH consumption. © 2014 British Ecological Society.","Adaptation; Chernobyl; Ionizing radiation; Oxidative stress; Pheomelanin",

Failure to consider the importance of scale in conservation physiology-both the challenges and the opportunities that it creates-will impede the ability of this discipline to generate the scientific understanding needed to contribute to meaningful conservation outcomes. Here, we have focused on five aspects of scale: biological, spatial, temporal, allometric and phylogenetic. We also considered the scale of policy and policy application relevant to those five types of scale as well as the merits of upscaling and downscaling to explore and address conservation problems. Although relevant to all systems (e.g. freshwater, terrestrial) we have used examples from the marine realm, with a particular emphasis on fishes, given the fact that there is existing discourse regarding scale and its relevance for marine conservation and management. Our synthesis revealed that all five aspects of scale are relevant to conservation physiology, with many aspects inherently linked. It is apparent that there are both opportunities and challenges afforded by working across scales but, to understand mechanisms underlying conservation problems, it is essential to consider scale of all sorts and to work across scales to the greatest extent possible. Moreover, given that the scales in biological processes will often not match policy and management scales, conservation physiology needs to show how it is relevant to aspects at different policy/ management scales, change the scales at which policy/management intervention is applied or be prepared to be ignored. © The Author 2014.","Body size; Downscaling; Marine; Scale; Upscaling",

Fluorescein, a presumptive test for blood, has been shown to have the capability to detect and quantify fish epithelial injury. However, there are several other presumptive tests for blood (Bluestar®, phenolphthalein, and Hemastix®) that may have benefits over the use of fluorescein, particularly for field research on wild fish. This study investigated the capabilities of these four tests to detect and quantify a variety of injuries commonly encountered by fish (abrasion, cuts, fin frays, and punctures) using the freshwater bluegill Lepomis macrochirus as a model. Fluorescein was consistently found to be the most reliable (i.e., detected the highest proportion of true positive results and rarely detected false positive reactions) of the four presumptive tests for blood compared. Further testing was conducted to examine the reliability of fluorescein. By 24 h after an injury was inflicted, the injury was no longer detectable by fluorescein, and when fluorescein was applied to an injured fish, the fluorescein was no longer detectable 3 h after application. In a comparison of two common anaesthetics used in fisheries research, there was no significant difference in the proportion of injury detected when 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester methanesulfate (tricaine) was used compared with a clove oil and ethanol (1:9) solution. In summary, fluorescein was the most reliable presumptive test for blood examined in this study for the detection and quantification of recent (hours) fish epithelial injury.","Fish injury detection; Fluorescein; Presumptive tests for blood",

Because melanogenesis and immunity have partly common genetic control, maternal effects via egg immune factors and parental melanization may covary. Here, we tested whether barn swallows Hirundo rustica allocated antibodies against a novel antigen to their eggs according to embryo sex depending on maternal melanin-based coloration while controlling for paternal tail ornamentation. Egg antibody concentration increased with maternal plumage darkness in broods with relatively more females, whereas it decreased in broods with relatively more males. Thus, darker females allocated more antibodies to their eggs when offspring sex ratio was female biased, whereas paler females allocated more antibodies to the eggs when offspring sex ratio was male biased. These effects were independent of laying order. Our results are compatible with the hypotheses that maternal allocation to sons depends on their reproductive value as predicted by heritable melanin-based coloration and with the hypothesis of differential susceptibility of pheomelanic daughters to parasitism. These effects may depend on pleiotropy of the genes that control melanogenesis and immunity, which may differentially act on investment in self-maintenance and maternal effects. This study is the first study in vertebrates of the association between maternal effects on either sex via egg quality and parental melanization. The links between the genetic control of melanogenesis and of major fitness traits like immunity and the role of maternal effects in reproductive strategies prompt for more studies of the covariation between parental coloration and maternal sex-dependent allocation via egg quality. © 2014 © The Author 2014.

Spilling excess water through the radial gate of the dam decreased the attraction efficiency of a vertical-slot fishway by 90% and increased delay below the dam by 2h, which had adverse effects on passage.

Methodology/Principal Finding: Here we analyzed paired information on 89 parasite populations for 24 species of bird hosts some years ago and again in 2010 with an average interval of 10 years. The parasite taxa included protozoa, feather parasites, diptera, ticks, mites and fleas. We investigated whether change in abundance and prevalence of parasites was related to change in body condition, reproduction and population size of hosts. We conducted analyses based on the entire dataset, but also on a restricted dataset with intervals between study years being 5-15 years. Parasite abundance increased over time when restricting the analyses to datasets with an interval of 5-15 years, with no significant effect of changes in temperature at the time of breeding among study sites. Changes in host body condition and clutch size were related to change in temperature between first and second study year. In addition, changes in clutch size, brood size and body condition of hosts were correlated with change in abundance of parasites. Finally, changes in population size of hosts were not significantly related to changes in abundance of parasites or their prevalence. Conclusions/Significance: Climate change is associated with a general increase in parasite abundance. Variation in laying date depended on locality and was associated with latitude while body condition of hosts was associated with a change in temperature. Because clutch size, brood size and body condition were associated with change in parasitism, these results suggest that parasites, perhaps mediated through the indirect effects of temperature, may affect fecundity and condition of their hosts. The conclusions were particularly in accordance with predictions when the restricted dataset with intervals of 5-15 years was used, suggesting that short intervals may bias findings. © 2013 Møller et al.",,"article; climate change; comparative study; controlled study; egg laying; environmental temperature; fertility; geographic distribution; host parasite interaction; life history; nonhuman; parasite transmission; parasite virulence; population abundance; population density; population distribution; population size; Animals; Birds; Climate Change; Europe; Female; Global Warming; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Male; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Time Factors"

These compounds can also mediate immune-modulatory effects that may contribute to their anticancer effects. However, HDACi can also induce anti-inflammatory, and potentially immunosuppressive, outcomes. We therefore sought to clarify the role of the immune system in mediating the efficacy of HDACi in a physiologic setting, using preclinical, syngeneic murine models of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.Weshowed an intact immune system was required for the robust anticancer effects of the HDACi vorinostat and panobinostat against a colon adenocarcinoma and two aggressive models of leukemia/lymphoma. Importantly, although HDACi-treated immunocompromised mice bearing established lymphoma succumbed to disease significantly earlier than tumor bearing, HDACitreated wild-type (WT) mice, treatment with the conventional chemotherapeutic etoposide equivalently enhanced the survival of both strains. IFN-g and tumor cell signaling through IFN-gR were particularly important for the anticancer effects of HDACi, and vorinostat and IFN-g acted in concert to enhance the immunogenicity of tumor cells. Furthermore, we show that a combination of vorinostat with a-galactosylceramide (a-GalCer), an IFN-g-inducing agent, was significantly more potent against established lymphoma than vorinostat treatment alone. Intriguingly, B cells, but not natural killer cells or CD8 T cells, were implicated as effectors of the vorinostat antitumor immune response.

Primary tumor cells orchestrate pre-metastatic niche formation through secretion of a variety of cytokines and growth factors that promote mobilization and recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to future metastatic sites. Hypoxia within the primary tumor, and secretion of specific microvesicles termed exosomes, are emerging as important processes and vehicles for tumor-derived factors to modulate pre-metastatic sites. It has also come to light that reduced immune surveillance is a novel mechanism through which primary tumors create favorable niches in secondary organs. This review provides an overview of our current understanding of underlying mechanisms of pre-metastatic niche formation and highlights the common links as well as discrepancies between independent studies. Furthermore, the possible clinical implications, links to metastatic persistence and dormancy, and novel approaches for treatment of metastatic disease through reversal of pre-metastatic niche formation are identified and explored. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Exosomes; Hypoxia; Immunosuppression; Myeloid-derived suppressor cells; Pre-metastatic niche; Tumor dormancy","cytokine; growth factor; bone marrow cell; cytokine release; exosome; human; immunosurveillance; metastasis; nonhuman; priority journal; review; tumor immunity; Animals; Anoxia; Disease Progression; Exosomes; Humans; Myeloid Cells; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasms; Tumor Microenvironment"

Melanization is associated with major life-history traits, including immune and stress response, possibly because of pleiotropic effects of genes that control melanogenesis. The net effects on pheo- versus eumelanization and other life-history traits may depend on the antagonistic effects of the genes that trigger the biosynthesis of either melanin form. Covariation between melanin-based pigmentation and fitness traits enforced by pleiotropic genes has major evolutionary implications particularly for socio-sexual communication. However, evidence from non-model organisms in the wild is limited to very few species. Here, we tested the hypothesis that melanin-based coloration of barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) throat and belly feathers covaries with acquired immunity and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, as gauged by corticosterone plasma levels. Individuals of both sexes with darker brownish belly feathers had weaker humoral immune response, while darker males had higher circulating corticosterone levels only when parental workload was experimentally reduced. Because color of belly feathers depends on both eu- and pheomelanin, and its darkness decreases with an increase in the concentration of eu- relative to pheomelanin, these results are consistent with our expectation that relatively more eu- than pheomelanized individuals have better immune response and smaller activation of the HPA-axis. Covariation of immune and stress response arose for belly but not throat feather color, suggesting that any function of color as a signal of individual quality or of alternative life-history strategies depends on plumage region. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Color; Corticosterone; Hirundo rustica; Immunity; Melanin; Sex","Animalia; Aves; Hirundo; Hirundo rustica"

Climate change can influence migration distance and phenology, potentially affecting patterns of mortality, as well as distribution and reproductive success in ducks. Studies addressing effects of climate change are, however, restricted to very few duck species, including mallard Anas platyrhynchos and common eider Somateria mollissima.

In this study, we cloned and sequenced four GST genes from the monogonont rotifer Brachionus koreanus. The domain regions of four Bk-GSTs showed a high similarity to those of other species. In addition, to evaluate the potential of GST genes as an earlywarning signal for oxidative stress, we exposed sublethal concentrations of copper (Cu) to B. koreanus and measured glutathione (GSH) contents and several antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx; EC 1.11.1.9), and glutathione reductase (GR; EC 1.8.1.7). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) at 12 h and 24 h after copper exposure increased significantly. GSH contents however did not increase significantly and even it decreased at 0.24 mg/L at 12 h. The activities of several antioxidant enzymes, particularly GPx and GR, showed a dramatic increase in 0.24 mg/L of CuCl2.Messenger RNAs of each Bk-GST showed different patterns ofmodulations according to GST types, and particularly, Bk-GST-omega, Bk-GST-sigma, and Bk-GST zeta genes were highly sensitive to Cu. These results indicate that Bk-GSTs, functioning as one of the enzymatic defense mechanisms particularly in the early stage of oxidative stress response, were induced by Cu exposure. This also suggests that these genes and related enzymes have a potential as biomarkers for a more sensitive initial stress response. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, southern populations are also often marginal populations relative to the entire breeding range, and marginality may also have negative effects on populations. To disentangle the effects of latitude (possibly due to global warming) and marginality on temporal variation in population size, we investigated European breeding bird species across a latitudinal gradient. Population size estimates were regressed on years, and from these regressions we obtained the slope (a proxy for population trend) and the standard error of the estimate (SEE) (a proxy for population fluctuations). The possible relationships between marginality or latitude on one hand and slopes or SEE on the other were tested among populations within species. Potentially confounding factors such as census method, sampling effort, density-dependence, habitat fragmentation and number of sampling years were controlled statistically. Population latitude was positively related to regression slopes independent of marginality, with more positive slopes (i.e., trends) in northern than in southern populations. The degree of marginality was positively related to SEE independent of latitude, with marginal populations showing larger SEE (i.e., fluctuations) than central ones. Regression slopes were also significantly related to our estimate of density-dependence and SEE was significantly affected by the census method. These results are consistent with a scenario in which southern and northern populations of European bird species are negatively affected by marginality, with southern populations benefitting less from global warming than northern populations, thus potentially making southern populations more vulnerable to extinction. © 2013 Cuervo, Møller.",,"analytical parameters; article; bird; breeding; controlled study; environmental impact; European bird; geographic distribution; geographical variation (species); greenhouse effect; habitat fragmentation; latitude; nonhuman; population density dependence; population distribution; population research; population size; sampling; species comparison; species distribution; standard error of the estimate; trend study; Animals; Birds; Europe"

As such, there is a need for promoting adoption of responsible fishing practices. We interviewed recreational sockeye salmon anglers in the lower Fraser River, British Columbia, to assess their awareness of responsible fishing practices and identify gaps where improved education could promote conservation-oriented behaviors. Based on our interview data, we developed three latent class models of salmon angler typologies based on: 1) anglers' fishing behaviors and preferences, 2) anglers' perceived risks to salmon survival due to post-capture live release, and 3) anglers' level of support for education programs. In the first model, we identified salmon-only anglers (33% of sample), lake-species specialists (46%), and all-around anglers (21%). These classes were differentiated primarily by non-salmon fishing activities (e.g., other target species). In the second model, we found four classes of anglers who differed with regards to key factors they thought affected post-release survival: air exposure (39% of sample); water temperature (24%); hook location (22%); and revival effort (15%). In the third model, we found anglers were either supporters (73%) or non-supporters (27%) of angler education programs. Heterogeneity existed among anglers but we found no correlations in angler classes across models, nor any significant demographic or experiential predictors of class membership. Respondents generally had high awareness and application of catch-and-release best practices, with lake-species specialists rating a higher awareness and usage of recommended catch-and-release technique, and were significantly more likely to cut the line on deeply hooked fish than other groups. Our findings provide resource managers with important insight into the attitudes and behaviors of sockeye salmon anglers in the important lower Fraser River recreational fishery. Our findings also highlight, however, the need for further research on the determinants of angler beliefs and behavior in order to customize programs to build anglers' awareness and adoption of responsible fishing practices. © 2013.","Angler awareness; Angler education; Angler heterogeneity; Catch-and-release; Human dimensions; Latent class cluster analysis; Post-release survival; Social science","catchability; correlation; fishery production; heterogeneity; recreational activity; species conservation; survival; survivorship; adult; aged; article; attitude; awareness; behavior; Canada; controlled study; education program; female; fishery management; fishing; human; introspection; major clinical study; male; nontarget organism; recreation; salmon; water temperature; Angler awareness; Angler education; Angler heterogeneity; Catch-and-release; Human dimensions; Latent class cluster analysis; Post-release survival; Social science; Adult; Aged; Animals; Attitude; British Columbia; Cluster Analysis; Conservation of Natural Resources; Culture; Data Collection; Female; Fisheries; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Mortality; Recreation; Salmon; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult; British Columbia; Canada; Pacific Ocean"

There are, however, exceedingly few public engagement success stories related to inland fishes and fisheries policy and resource allocation decisions. Inland aquatic resources and their associated fisheries provide employment, recreation, culture and, in developing regions, a considerable proportion of human nutrition and food security. Freshwater fishes are incredibly diverse but are among the most endangered organisms globally. Many threats to inland fisheries are driven largely by externalities to inland fisheries. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the role and plight of inland fishes and fisheries, and the need to generate the public and political will necessary to promote meaningful conservation. With this paper, the extent to which the scientific and environmental management communities have failed to engage the public in issues related to inland fishes and fisheries is characterized. Next, the barriers or factors that serve as the basis for the problem with public engagement are identified. The paper concludes by identifying strategies, including those focused on environmental education initiatives, for building the public and political will necessary to promote meaningful conservation of inland fishes and fisheries in developed and developing countries. Scientists, environmental managers, non-governmental organizations, politicians, regulatory authorities and the media all have important roles to play in overcoming challenges to inland fisheries. Failure to engage the public in freshwater conservation and management issues will impede efforts to stem the loss of freshwater habitats, fisheries and aquatic biodiversity. Thankfully, there are opportunities to learn from success stories related to other environmental issues and initiatives that have been successful in marine fish conservation. © 2013 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","Biodiversity; Conservation; Environmental education; Policy; Sustainable fisheries","Pisces; fresh water; animal; article; biodiversity; conservation; consumer; environmental education; environmental planning; environmental protection; fish; fishery; interpersonal communication; legal aspect; policy; sustainable fisheries; biodiversity; conservation; environmental education; policy; sustainable fisheries; Animals; Communication; Conservation of Natural Resources; Consumer Participation; Environmental Policy; Fisheries; Fishes; Fresh Water"

The full-length TJ-CHH cDNA was 716 bp in length, encoding 136 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequences of TJ-CHH showed a high similarity of the CHH mature domain to other crustaceans. Six conserved cysteine residues and five conserved structural motifs in the CHH mature peptide domain were also observed. The genomic structure of the TJ-CHH gene contained three exons and two introns in its open reading frame (ORF), and several transcriptional elements were detected in the promoter region of the TJ-CHH gene. To investigate transcriptional change of TJ-CHH under environmental stress, T. japonicus were exposed to heat treatment, UV-B radiation, heavy metals, and water-accommodated fractions (WAFs) of Iranian crude oil. Upon heat stress, TJ-CHH transcripts were elevated at 30 C and 35 C for 96 h in a time-course experiment. UV-B radiation led to a decreased pattern of the TJ-CHH transcript 48 h and more after radiation (12 kJ/m2). After exposure of a fixed dose (12 kJ/m2) in a time-course experiment, TJ-CHH transcript was down-regulated in time-dependent manner with a lowest value at 12 h. However, the TJ-CHH transcript level was increased in response to five heavy metal exposures for 96 h. Also, the level of the TJ-CHH transcript was significantly up-regulated at 20% of WAFs after exposure to WAFs for 48 h and then remarkably reduced in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that the enhanced TJ-CHH transcript level is associated with a cellular stress response of the TJ-CHH gene as shown in decapod crustaceans.

In addition, pollution has affected even the most remote ecosystems, as has the omnipresence of humans, with consequences in particular for animals that keep a safe distance from potential predators, including human beings. Importantly, all of these changes are occurring simultaneously, with increasing intensity, and further deterioration in both the short and the long-term is predicted. While the consequences of these components of global change are relatively well studied on their own, the effects of their interactions, such as the combined effects of climate change and agriculture, or the combined effects of agriculture through nutrient leakage to freshwater and marine ecosystems and fisheries, and the effects of climate change and urbanization, are poorly understood. Here, I provide a brief overview of the effects of climate change on phenology, diversity, abundance, interspecific interactions and population dynamics of birds. I address whether these effects of changing temperatures are direct, or indirect through effects of climate change on the phenology, distribution or abundance of food, parasites and predators.

As a result, the level of gamma radiation-induced DNA damage was initiated after 4. Gy of radiation, and biochemical and molecular damage became substantial from 8. Gy. In particular, several DNA repair mechanism-related genes were significantly modulated in the 6. Gy gamma radiation-exposed fish larvae, suggesting that upregulation of such DNA repair genes was closely associated with cell survival after gamma irradiation. The mRNA expression of p53 and most hsps was also significantly upregulated at high doses of gamma radiation related to cellular damage. This finding indicates that gamma radiation can induce oxidative stress with associated antioxidant enzyme activities, and linked to modulation of the expression of DNA repair-related genes as one of the defense mechanisms against radiation damage.

CD73 also enhances tumor metastasis, although the nature of the immune subsets and adenosine receptor subtypes involved in this process are largely unknown. In this study, we revealed that A2A/A2B receptor antagonists were effective in reducing the metastasis of tumors expressing CD73 endogenously (4T1.2 breast tumors) and when CD73 was ectopically expressed (B16F10 melanoma). A 2A -/- mice were strongly protected against tumor metastasis, indicating that host A2A receptors enhanced tumor metastasis. A2A blockade enhanced natural killer (NK) cell maturation and cytotoxic function in vitro, reduced metastasis in a perforin-dependent manner, and enhanced NK cell expression of granzyme B in vivo, strongly suggesting that the antimetastatic effect of A2A blockade was due to enhanced NK cell function. Interestingly, A2B blockade had no effect on NK cell cytotoxicity, indicating that an NK cell-independent mechanism also contributed to the increased metastasis of CD73+ tumors. Our results thus revealed that CD73 promotes tumor metastasis through multiple mechanisms, including suppression of NK cell function. Furthermore, our data strongly suggest that A2A or A2B antagonists may be useful for the treatment of metastatic disease. Overall, our study has potential therapeutic implications given that A2A/A2B receptor antagonists have already entered clinical trials in other therapeutic settings.","Cancer metastasis; Immunotherapy; Innate immunity; Tumor immunosuppression","5' nucleotidase; adenosine A2a receptor; adenosine A2a receptor antagonist; adenosine A2b receptor antagonist; adenosine receptor blocking agent; granzyme B; perforin; unclassified drug; 1-propyl-8-(4-sulfophenyl)xanthine; 5' nucleotidase; 5-amino-7-(2-phenylethyl)-2-(2-furyl)pyrazolo(4,3-e)-1,2,4-triazolo(1,5-c)pyrimidine; adenosine A2 receptor antagonist; adenosine A2a receptor; adenosine A2b receptor; granzyme; pyrimidine derivative; triazole derivative; xanthine derivative; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; breast adenocarcinoma; cell function; cell maturation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; melanoma; metastasis; metastasis inhibition; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; animal; Bagg albino mouse; C57BL mouse; drug effects; experimental neoplasm; flow cytometry; genetics; human; immunology; knockout mouse; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; tumor cell line; 5'-Nucleotidase; Adenosine A2 Receptor Antagonists; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Flow Cytometry; Granzymes; Humans; Killer Cells, Natural; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasms, Experimental; Pyrimidines; Receptor, Adenosine A2A; Receptor, Adenosine A2B; Triazoles; Xanthines"

These syntheses emphasize the importance of generating estimates of attraction and passage efficiency, using electronic tagging techniques, as the ""gold standard"" for determining if a fishway is indeed successful at passing target species upstream to meet ecological, management, and conservation goals. Such an emphasis on efficiency is potentially problematic if estimates of attraction and passage efficiency are biased or otherwise fail to reliably represent the true biological effectiveness of a fishway. Indeed, erroneous estimates could lead to management decisions (in terms of both design criteria and operational decisions) that are costly in terms of economic expenditures and failed conservation outcomes for populations, species and ecosystems. Here we review the factors that are necessary to consider when determining the reliability of efficiency estimates for fishways and provide suggestions for improving such estimates. Clearly there is need for greater attention to the effects of various capture (including gear and the timing and location of capture), handling, and tagging protocols on fish necessary to monitor individual passage success given the potential for procedures to influence organismal condition and behavior. In addition, there is need for more long-term tagging studies (monitoring individuals across multiple seasons), mechanistic studies to understand the biological basis for differences in efficiency estimates, greater use of control studies to account for natural levels of migration failure/behavioral heterogeneity, technical validation of electronic tagging equipment (to account for tag failure and detection efficiency), and the use of approaches that combine individual monitoring with population-level studies (including modeling exercises). Also relevant is the need to better understand the proportion of fish that need to pass a fishway to address ecological, management and conservation targets, as well as identify the proportion of a population that is actually motivated to attempt passage in a given season. Failure to think critically about the factors for a given study/site that have the potential to influence estimates of passage and attraction efficiency will impede the ability of science and monitoring activities to inform fishway design and operation and ultimately improve aquatic ecosystems. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..","Barriers; Efficiency; Fishways; Passage; Telemetry","Barriers; Biological effectiveness; Design and operations; Individual monitoring; Management and conservations; Monitoring activities; Operational decisions; Passage; Conservation; Ecology; Efficiency; Estimation; Fish; Fishways; Gears; Telemetering; Fisheries; aquatic ecosystem; conservation planning; economic analysis; electronic equipment; estimation method; fishery management; heterogeneity; migration route; reliability analysis; tagging"

We carried out flight initiation distance experiments in 207 bird species in 7 pairs of urban-rural areas from northern to southern Europe before and after the extremely cold winter of 2009-2010. Flight initiation distance in different species of birds on average became shorter after the cold winter, but only in resident urban populations (frequently exposed to humans) and not in migratory or rural populations of the same species. There were independent partial effects of human population density with an increase in flight initiation distance from before to after the cold winter of 2009-2010 at low population densities and a decrease at high population densities, and there was an independent effect of latitude with the flight initiation distance increasing from 2009 to 2010 at low latitudes and decreasing from 2009 to 2010 at high latitudes. The difference in flight initiation distance before and after the cold winter increased with severity of the winter across different study areas. Therefore, the difference in flight initiation distance between urban and rural habitats increased after the cold winter, especially in areas with the coldest winter weather. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a behavioral component of urbanization is due to reduced flight initiation distance in urban environments and suggest that weather conditions (i.e., cold winters) have played an important role in the process of urbanization. © 2013 © The Author 2013.

As de-regulated Stat1 function can affect tumour progression we sought to elucidate the effects of tumour cell-intrinsic Stat1 expression on immunosurveillance. Knockout of Stat1 enhanced the development of sarcomas induced by the chemical carcinogen 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA). Growth of transplanted MCA-induced Stat1-/- sarcomas was suppressed in wild-type mice compared to growth in Stat1 -/- and immunocompromised recipients. Co-depletion of NK and CD8+T cells from wild-type mice facilitated Stat1-deficient tumour growth whereas depletion of CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells did not. In vitro and in vivo analysis of the tumours implicated a role for NK cell-mediated, perforin-dependent killing of Stat1-deficient tumours. Interestingly, restoration of Stat1 expression in Stat1-/-tumours resulted in diminished involvement of NK cells and increased contribution of CD8+T cells in anti-tumour responses. Therefore, Stat1 expression within tumour cells modulated anti-tumour immune responses by altering the dominant immune effector cell involvement from NK cells to CD8+T cells in the absence or presence of Stat1 respectively. © 2013 Australasian Society for Immunology Inc.

First, if the relationship is positive then females could gain a direct benefit by choosing more attractive males for fertility assurance reasons ('the phenotype-linked fertility' hypothesis). Second, there is much interest in the direction of the correlation between traits favoured by pre-copulatory sexual selection (i.e. affecting mating success) and those favoured by post-copulatory sexual selection (i.e. increasing sperm competitiveness). If the relationship is negative this could lead to the two forms of selection counteracting each other. Theory predicts that the direction of the relationship could be either positive or negative depending on the underlying genetic variance and covariance in each trait, the extent of variation among males in condition (resources available to allocate to reproductive traits), and variation among males in the cost or rate of mating. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the average relationship between the expression of behavioural and morphological male secondary sexual characters and four assays of ejaculate quality (sperm number, viability, swimming speed and size). Regardless of how the data were partitioned the mean relationship was consistently positive, but always statistically non-significant. The only exception was that secondary sexual character expression was weakly but significantly positively correlated with sperm viability (r=0.07, P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the strength or direction of the relationship between behavioural and morphological SSCs, nor among relationships using the four ejaculate quality assays.

However, sub-lethal indicators of organismal condition have the potential to reveal mechanisms associated with mortality (both at time of capture and post-release) and opportunities for improving fish welfare. In this study, we simulated commercial fishing efforts in inland lakes with fyke nets during a typical fishing season (early April to late June) in southeastern Ontario, Canada, where bycatch of non-target fish species had previously been documented. Using non-target gamefish (i.e., largemouth bass [. Micropterus salmoides, Lacépède], northern pike [. Esox Lucius, L.]), as well as a target species (i.e., bluegill [. Lepomis macrochirus, Rafinesque]), we examined the sub-lethal consequences of capture (e.g., blood physiology, reflex impairment, and injury) and compared the effects of being retained in the net for two different durations (i.e., two or six days) over a range of water temperatures (i.e., 3-28. °C). Sub-lethal physiological disturbances (i.e., blood glucose and lactate) in largemouth bass and bluegill tended to be greater at higher water temperatures. However, fish retained for six days generally did not exhibit greater stress than those retained for two days, with the exception of plasma glucose in largemouth bass. Reflex impairment was similar among temperature and retention periods. Fish retained in nets experienced a range of injuries (including fin frays, scale loss, and mouth damage) that had the potential to facilitate the development of opportunistic pathogenic infections. Greater incidences of injury on fish bycatch tended to be associated with higher temperatures and longer retention. To reduce physiological disturbances and injury that could lead to delayed mortality, we suggest that regulations for inland commercial fishers require them to check their nets more frequently as water temperatures increase. We suggest that future studies of bycatch incorporate sub-lethal endpoints given that they serve as an objective measure of fish welfare and can provide quantitative mechanistic information to support management actions. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","Bycatch; Injury; Inland commercial fisheries; Physiology","bycatch; commercial species; finfish; inland fishery; mortality; nontarget organism; perciform; physiology; small scale industry; water temperature; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Esocidae; Esox lucius; Lepomis macrochirus; Micropterus; Micropterus salmoides"

Therefore, we would expect cataracts to be associated with reduced fitness in free-living animals.Methodology/Principal Findings:We investigated the incidence of lens opacities typical of cataracts in more than 1100 free-living birds in the Chernobyl region in relation to background radiation. The incidence of cataracts increased with level of background radiation both in analyses based on a dichotomous score and in analyses of continuous scores of intensity of cataracts. The odds ratio per unit change in the regressor was 0.722 (95% CI 0.648, 0.804), which was less than odds ratios from investigations of radiation cataracts in humans. The relatively small odds ratio may be due to increased mortality in birds with cataracts. We found a stronger negative relationship between bird abundance and background radiation when the frequency of cataracts was higher, but also a direct effect of radiation on abundance, suggesting that radiation indirectly affects abundance negatively through an increase in the frequency of cataracts in bird populations, but also through direct effects of radiation on other diseases, food abundance and interactions with other species. There was no increase in incidence of cataracts with increasing age, suggesting that yearlings and older individuals were similarly affected as is typical of radiation cataract.Conclusions/Significance:These findings suggest that cataracts are an under-estimated cause of morbidity in free-living birds and, by inference, other vertebrates in areas contaminated with radioactive materials. © 2013 Møller, Mousseau.",,"aging; animal food; article; bird disease; Chernobyl accident; frequency analysis; incidence; mortality; nonhuman; organismal interaction; population abundance; radiation cataract; radiation exposure; radioactive contamination; risk assessment; yearling; Animals; Bird Diseases; Cataract; Chernobyl Nuclear Accident; Incidence; Radiation, Ionizing"

Increased levels of TRF2, a key factor in telomere protection, are observed in various human malignancies and contribute to oncogenesis. We demonstrate here that a high level of TRF2 in tumour cells decreased their ability to recruit and activate natural killer (NK) cells. Conversely, a reduced dose of TRF2 enabled tumour cells to be more easily eliminated by NK cells. Consistent with these results, a progressive upregulation of TRF2 correlated with decreased NK cell density during the early development of human colon cancer. By screening for TRF2-bound genes, we found that HS3ST4 - A gene encoding for the heparan sulphate (glucosamine) 3-O-sulphotransferase 4 - was regulated by TRF2 and inhibited the recruitment of NK cells in an epistatic relationship with TRF2.

Despite being difficult to discern during the nonreproductive period, sex-related differences in body condition and shape can yield important insights into a species' behaviour and ecology. The purpose of this study was to test hypotheses about body condition and shape variation related to sex and season (nonreproductive and reproductive periods) in a population of adult adfluvial bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus (Suckley, 1859)), which is a poorly understood and imperiled species across much of its range. Geometric morphometric samples were collected by angling in the spring and late summer in a reservoir in British Columbia. Principal components analysis identified two principal components (PC) that were related to body condition and that varied according to season and sex. Spring-caught females were in better body condition than spring-caught males. There was a significant sex × season interaction on body condition such that late-summer males were not different from late-summer females. Spawning bull trout exhibited a decline in body condition during the summer season. An additional PC that described head size was found to vary significantly between sexes; however, an assignment test showed that it failed to reliably distinguish between the sexes. We hypothesized that the ecology of these animals, including sex-specific behaviour, is responsible for sexual and seasonal differences in bull trout body condition and morphology. This study offers new insight into the ecology of bull trout and shows that shape data for fishes can be obtained nonlethally, which is particularly important for species that are imperiled.","Adfluvial; Body condition; Body shape; Bull trout; Geometric morphometrics; Kinbasket reservoir; Morphology; Salvelinus confluentus; Sexual dimorphism; Threatened species","adult; body condition; data acquisition; fish; morphometry; principal component analysis; reproductive biology; seasonal variation; sexual dimorphism; spawning; British Columbia; Canada"

It is believed that high wing aspect ratio (ratio of wing span squared to wing area) and low wing loading (ratio of body weight to wing area) both reduce the energetic costs of flight, thus allowing for enduring flight and fast migration. We addressed this topic in a four-year study on the Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica population near Warsaw, Central Poland. We hypothesized that individuals possessing wings with higher aspect ratio and lower loading should arrive at the breeding area earlier than other individuals, and that these individuals should be characterized by higher annual survival than the average individual. Male Barn Swallows arrived at the breeding ground on average earlier than females, and older birds arrived earlier than second year birds. Males with high aspect ratio wings arrived from Africa earlier than the average male, independent of age. There was no significant association between aspect ratio and arrival date in females. The relationship between male wing aspect ratio and arrival date remained significant when controlling for the effects of potential confounding variables (including the estimates of male phenotypic quality, body condition and body size). High aspect ratio wings may help male Barn Swallows migrate faster than the average male, and thus arrive at the breeding area earlier in spring and achieve the benefits of early arrival. However, the relationship was weak, explaining only 5% of the variation in male arrival date (age, and hence experience, explained 38% of the variance). Wing loading was significantly correlated with timing of arrival in both male and female Barn Swallows, with early arrivals being characterized by higher wing loading than later ones. This finding can be explained by the benefits of arrival at the breeding quarters with body reserves that should help copy with costs of early arrival. We found no significant relationship between wing area and timing of arrival. Furthermore, we found no evidence for wing aspect ratio and wing loading determining annual survival rate in the Barn Swallow.","arrival date; Barn Swallow; flight morphology; Hirundo rustica; migration; migration syndrome","arrival date; flight; morphology; passerine; seasonal variation; survival; wing; Mazowieckie; Poland; Warsaw [Mazowieckie]"

Because predator diversity and abundance decreases with increasing latitude, and differs between rural and urban areas, we should expect escape distance when a predator approached the individual to decrease with latitude and depend on urbanization. We measured the distance at which individual birds fled (flight initiation distance, FID, which represents a reliable and previously validated surrogate measure of response to predation risk) following a standardized protocol in nine pairs of rural and urban sites along a ca. 3000 km gradient from Southern Spain to Northern Finland during the breeding seasons 2009-2010. Raptor abundance was estimated by means of standard point counts at the same sites where FID information was recorded. Data on body mass and phylogenetic relationships among bird species sampled were extracted from the literature. An analysis of 12,495 flight distances of 714 populations of 159 species showed that mean FID decreased with increasing latitude after accounting for body size and phylogenetic effects. This decrease was paralleled by a similar cline in an index of the abundance of raptors. Urban populations had consistently shorter FIDs, supporting previous findings. The difference between rural and urban habitats decreased with increasing latitude, also paralleling raptor abundance trends. Overall, the latitudinal gradient in bird fear was explained by raptor abundance gradients, with additional small effects of latitude and intermediate effects of habitat. This study provides the first empirical documentation of a latitudinal trend in anti-predator behavior, which correlated positively with a similar trend in the abundance of predators. © 2013 Díaz et al.",,"adaptation; animal behavior; article; body mass; body size; breeding; effect size; Europe; fear; Finland; flight initiation distance; geographic and geological parameters; latitude; nonhuman; phylogeny; population abundance; population density; predator avoidance; raptor; rural area; rural population; Spain; species distribution; species habitat; trend study; urban area; urban population; Animals; Birds; Ecosystem; Escape Reaction; Europe; Fear; Flight, Animal; Geography; Phylogeny; Predatory Behavior; Raptors; Species Specificity; Animalia; Aves; Raptores"

We also analyzed further CYP-involved detoxification and endogenous steroidogenic metabolism after exposure to different concentrations of WAFs over different time courses in the marine medaka. Also, detoxification- and antioxidant-related enzymes' activities were analyzed with different concentrations of WAFs. As a result, the WAF exposure induced CYP-involved detoxification mechanism but reduced CYP-involved steroidogenic metabolism in the marine medaka. These data suggest that whole CYP profiling can be a way of understanding and uncovering the mode of action particularly with respect to emerging chemicals such as WAF exposure with the new finding that WAFs have dual functions on CYP-involved metabolisms. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Cytochrome p450; Cytochrome P450 genes; Detoxification mechanism; Mode of action; Molecular mechanism; Molecular response; Oryzias melastigma; Stress response; Crude oil; Detoxification; Fish; Metabolism; Physiology; Gene expression; 3(or 17)beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; aromatase; cytochrome P450; cytochrome P450 19A2; glucuronosyltransferase; glutathione transferase; testosterone 17beta dehydrogenase; unclassified drug; water; crude oil; cytochrome; data acquisition; enzyme activity; fish; gene; gene expression; marine ecosystem; metabolism; oil pollution; pollution control; water pollution; animal experiment; article; controlled study; detoxification; embryo; enzyme activity; gene expression profiling; molecular biology; nonhuman; Oryzias; Oryzias melastigma; parameters; protein expression; steroidogenesis; water accommodated fraction; Animals; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Environmental Exposure; Gene Expression Profiling; Marine Biology; Oryzias; RNA, Messenger; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Xenobiotics"

We reviewed studies incorporating electronic-tagging techniques (including radio, acoustic, satellite, biologging, and passive integrated transponder tags) into restoration-monitoring programs and discuss novel uses of these technologies and experimental design considerations. We found 25 studies, mostly published after 2005. Most were focused on salmonids or monitored the residency of species at artificial reefs. Few studies used site-level replication or data collected prior to restoration or at control sites, which limits the usefulness of their results for evaluating restoration effectiveness. The use of electronic tags and related sensors (e.g., temperature, depth) can reveal how habitats are used and their associated bioenergetic costs or benefits. These technologies are focused on individual-and population-level responses and complement traditional methods of assessing abundance, richness, and community composition but must be deployed in conjunction with well-designed experiments to truly better inform evaluations of restoration effectiveness. © 2013 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.

This behavioural measure of risk-taking reflects the risk of being captured by real predators, and it correlates with a range of life history traits, as expected if flight distance optimizes risk of predation. Given that FID provides information on risk of predation, we should expect that physiological and morphological mechanisms that facilitate flight and escape predict interspecific variation in flight distance. Haematocrit is a measure of packed red blood cell volume and as such indicates the oxygen transport ability and hence the flight muscle contracting reaction of an individual. Therefore, we predicted that species with short flight distances, that allow close proximity between a potential prey individual and a predator, would have high haematocrit. Furthermore, we predicted that species with large wing areas and hence relatively low costs of flight and species with large aspect ratios and hence high manoeuvrability would have evolved long flight speed. Consistent with these predictions, we found in a sample of 63 species of birds that species with long flight distances for their body size had low levels of haematocrit and large wing areas and aspect ratios. These findings provide evidence consistent with the evolution of risk-taking behaviour being underpinned by physiological and morphological mechanisms that facilitate escape from predators and add to our understanding of predator-prey coevolution. © 2013 The Authors. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.","Anti-predator behaviour; Aspect ratio; Flight initiation distance; Haematocrit; Wing area","antipredator defense; aspect; avifauna; bird; blood; coevolution; escape behavior; evolutionary biology; flight; interspecific variation; life history trait; morphology; physiology; predator; predator-prey interaction; wing morphology; animal; article; bird; escape behavior; evolution; female; flying; forelimb; hematocrit; human; male; physiology; Animals; Biological Evolution; Birds; Escape Reaction; Female; Flight, Animal; Hematocrit; Humans; Male; Wing; Animalia; Aves"

We review the constraints associated with freshwater telemetry and biologging and the technical developments relevant to their use. Technical constraints for tracking animals are often influenced by the characteristics of the animals being studied and the environment they inhabit. Collectively, they influence which and how technologies can be used and their relative effectiveness. Although radio telemetry has historically been the most commonly used technology in freshwater, passive integrated transponder (PIT) technology, acoustic telemetry and biologgers are becoming more popular. Most telemetry studies have focused on fish, although an increasing number have focused on other taxa, such as turtles, crustaceans and molluscs. Key technical developments for freshwater systems include: miniaturization of tags for tracking small-size life stages and species, fixed stations and coded tags for tracking large samples of animals over long distances and large temporal scales, inexpensive PIT systems that enable mass tagging to yield population- and community-level relevant sample sizes, incorporation of sensors into electronic tags, validation of tag attachment procedures with a focus on maintaining animal welfare, incorporation of different techniques (for example, genetics, stable isotopes) and peripheral technologies (for example, geographic information systems, hydroacoustics), development of novel analytical techniques, and extensive international collaboration. Innovations are still needed in tag miniaturization, data analysis and visualization, and in tracking animals over larger spatial scales (for example, pelagic areas of lakes) and in challenging environments (for example, large dynamic floodplain systems, under ice). There seems to be a particular need for adapting various global positioning system and satellite tagging approaches to freshwater. Electronic tagging provides a mechanism to collect detailed information from imperilled animals and species that have no direct economic value. Current and future advances will continue to improve our knowledge of the natural history of aquatic animals and ecological processes in freshwater ecosystems while facilitating evidence-based resource management and conservation. © 2013 Cooke et al.","Acoustic telemetry; Biotelemetry; Coded tags; Passive integrated transponder; Radio telemetry",

The absence of DNAM-1 on the donor graft attenuated GVHD in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched and MHC-matched BMT following conditioning with lethal and sublethal irradiation. In contrast, DNAM-1 was not critical for GVL effects against ligand (CD155) expressing and nonexpressing leukemia. The effects on GVHD following myeloablative conditioning were independent of CD81 T cells and dependent on CD41 T cells, and specifically donor FoxP31 regulatory T cells (Treg).

Behaviour between cortisol-treated, sham-treated (injected with coconut butter) and control S. atromaculatus was compared in a mesocosm system, using a passive integrated transponder array, and in a natural stream system (excluding shams), using surgically implanted radio transmitters. While laboratory time-course studies revealed that the cortisol injection provided a physiologically relevant challenge, causing prolonged (c. 3days) elevations of plasma cortisol similar to that achieved with a standardized chasing protocol, no differences in fine-scale movements were observed between cortisol-treated, sham-treated and control S. atromaculatus nor in the large-scale movements of cortisol-treated and control S. atromaculatus. Moreover, no differences were observed in diel activity patterns among treatments. Differential mortality, however, occurred starting 10days after treatment where cortisol-treated S. atromaculatus exhibited nearly twice as many mortalities as shams and controls. These results suggest that, although the experimental manipulation of cortisol titres was sufficient to cause mortality in some individuals, there were compensatory mechanisms that maintained behaviours (i.e. including activity and movement) prior to death.

Due to the rapid attenuation of acoustic signals in shallow (<0.3 m) estuarine environments, we examined the applicability for a novel use of radio telemetry to examine the spatial ecology of checkered puffers, Sphoeroides testudineus Linnaeus, 1758, in shallow, tropical tidal creeks. External attachment of radio tags on the dorsal surface of the caudal peduncle resulted in reliable retention (100% after 5 d) for short-term applications, and no differences were observed in swimming ability or standard metabolic rate between tagged individuals and untagged controls. However, external tagging resulted in significant postural differences during routine activity in comparison to untagged controls, although we demonstrate that this can be eliminated by reducing tag burden in future studies. A small sample of puffers (n = 5) was subsequently radio tagged and released into a shallow tidal creek whereby attempts were made to relocate individuals both visually and using radio telemetry over a short period (1 hr). Checkered puffers exhibited an ability to move the entire length of a small tidal creek (maximum mobility 389 m), although using radio telemetry to monitor the movements of puffers had limited application with the techniques applied in the present study when individuals occupied water depths <0.2 m and were actively swimming. With minor modifications to tags and by reducing tag burden, radio telemetry could serve as a feasible means of monitoring the movements of site-associated species in shallow tidal creeks. © 2013 Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.",,"conservation management; estuarine environment; marine ecosystem; movement; radiotelemetry; spatial analysis; sustainable development; swimming; teleost; water depth; Pisces; Sphoeroides testudineus; Tetraodontidae"

Beyond simply documenting problems, physiological data are also being used to test and refine different strategies for handling fish such that stress is minimised and survival probability maximised, and in some cases, even for assessing and facilitating recovery post-release. The inherent sensitivity of physiological processes means that nearly every study conducted has found some level of - unavoidable - physiological disturbance arising from recreational capture and subsequent release. An underlying tenet of catch-and-release studies that incorporate physiological tools is that a link exists between physiological status and fitness. In reality, finding such relationships has been elusive, with further extensions of individual-level impacts to fish populations even more dubious. A focus of this article is to describe some of the challenges related to experimental design and interpretation that arise when using physiological tools for the study of the biological consequences of catch-and-release angling. Means of overcoming these challenges and the extrapolation of physiological data from individuals to the population level are discussed. The argument is presented that even if it is difficult to demonstrate strong links to mortality or other fitness measures, let alone population-level impacts of catch-and-release, there remains merit in using physiological tools as objective indicators of fish welfare, which is an increasing concern in recreational fisheries. The overarching objective of this paper is to provide a balanced critique of the use of physiological approaches in catch-and-release science and of their role in providing meaningful information for anglers and managers. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bycatch; Conservation physiology; Discards; Recreational fisheries; Stress","angling; bycatch; conservation status; ecological impact; experimental design; fishery management; fitness; mortality; physiological response; stakeholder; Pisces"

The overall conclusion was that future research and management efforts should increasingly focus on the feedbacks between the interacting human and ecological components of recreational fisheries. Doing so promises to improve understanding of how recreational fisheries respond to social-ecological change. In this context, the behaviour of both fishes and humans provides an important, yet often overlooked, integrator of the ecological and social components of recreational fisheries.

First, we identified and characterized the CYP1A gene from the marine medaka, Oryzias melastigma. O. melastigma CYP1A (Om-CYP1A) showed a high similarity of motifs/domains compared to those of vertebrates in their amino acid sequences. To check whether the Om-CYP1A would be inducible, we tested two strong CYP1A inducers, β-naphthoflavone (β-NF) and benzo[α]pyrene (B[α]P), and observed concentration-dependent transient expression on transcripts of Om-CYP1A for 96 h over a wide range of concentrations. Om-CYP1A mRNA level was significantly increased in exposure to different concentrations of β-NF and B[α]P, and its expression was highly transcribed within 12 h upon the exposure to low concentrations of both chemicals. Inducible transcript profiles revealed that Om-CYP1A would be associated with the toxicant metabolism via AhREs/DREs/XREs in its promoter region. To uncover the effects of the water-accommodated fraction (WAF) of crude oil on transcripts of Om-CYP1A, we measured mRNA expression of Om-CYP1A towards different concentrations of WAF for 24 h. As a result, WAF exposure significantly increased Om-CYP1A transcripts at all concentrations as well as during time-course experiments for 96 h. In this paper, we demonstrated that WAF would trigger up-regulation of the CYP1A gene that would be associated with the initiation of the cellular defense systems.

Adult female Pink Salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha and Chum Salmon O. keta were exposed to six experimental capture treatments that represented different levels of exhaustive exercise, air exposure, and injury. After we evaluated its reflex impairment and obtained a blood sample, each fish was released into its natal spawning channel with an external tag and later retrieved postmortem to evaluate spawning success via examining egg retention. Reflex impairment, plasma lactate, chloride, potassium, and osmolality varied among treatments, with differences generally driven by the length of exposure to capture stress, which included exhaustive exercise and air exposure. However, overall prespawn mortality was negligible (about 5%) and consistent across treatments for both species. We hypothesize that Pink and Chum Salmon are resilient to capture-related exhaustion upon reaching spawning areas because of a combination of low water temperature (about 12°C in this study) and a physiological shift towards increased use of anaerobic pathways during their final weeks of life. The capture and release of fish arriving at the spawning ground does not appear to influence survival, in contradiction to the results of other studies, which focused on earlier components of Pacific salmon spawning migrations. Fisheries adjacent to spawning sites represent the end of the continuum of salmon fisheries that begin with the high seas fishery and extend through the coastal and riverine environments. The mortality rates in this study should be interpreted cautiously by management until research efforts are broadened to provide a better understanding of how postrelease outcomes at different life stages compare in natural systems and under conditions more representative of real fisheries.Received May 20, 2012; accepted October 25, 2012. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"adult; arrival time; blood; body condition; breeding site; ecosystem resilience; environmental stress; fishery management; fishery modeling; injury; longevity; migration; mortality; reproductive success; salmonid; survival; water temperature; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Oncorhynchus keta"

However, which of the many cell types capable of producing IFN-γ controls Salmonella infections remains unclear. Using a mouse model of systemic Salmonella infection, we observed that only a lack of all lymphocytes or CD90 (Thy1) + cells, but not the absence of T cells, Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-γt-dependent lymphocytes, (NK)1.1+ cells, natural killer T (NKT), and/or B cells alone, replicated the highly susceptible phenotype of IFN-γ-deficient mice to Salmonella infection. A combination of antibody depletions and adoptive transfer experiments revealed that early protective IFN-γ was provided by Thy1-expressing natural killer (NK) cells and that these cells improved antibacterial immunity through the provision of IFN-γ. Further analysis of NK cells producing IFN-γ inresponse to Salmonella indicated that less mature NK cells were more efficient at mediating antibacterial effector function than terminally differentiated NK cells. Inspired by recent reports of Thy1+ NK cells contributing to immune memory, we analyzed their role in secondary protection against otherwise lethal WT Salmonella infections. Notably, we observed that a newly generated Salmonella vaccine strain not only conferred superior protection compared with conventional regimens but that this enhanced efficiency of recall immunity was afforded by incorporating CD4-CD8-Thy1+ cells into the secondary response. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Thy1-expressing NK cells play an important role in antibacterial immunity.","Cytokines; Infection immunity; Intracellular bacteria; Vaccination","gamma interferon; retinoid related orphan receptor gamma; salmonellosis vaccine; Thy 1 antigen; adoptive transfer; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; B lymphocyte; bacterial count; bacterial immunity; bacterial load; bacterial strain; cell function; controlled study; cytokine production; immunological memory; in vivo study; lymphocyte differentiation; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; Salmonella typhimurium; salmonellosis; Adoptive Transfer; Animals; Antigens, Thy-1; Cell Differentiation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Homeodomain Proteins; Interferon-gamma; Killer Cells, Natural; Lymphocyte Subsets; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Salmonella Infections, Animal; Salmonella typhimurium"

First, we consider the effects of natural levels of radiation on mutations, DNA repair and genetics. A total of 46 studies with 373 effect size estimates revealed a small, but highly significant mean effect that was independent of adjustment for publication bias. Second, we found different mean effect sizes when studies were based on broad categories like physiology, immunology and disease frequency; mean weighted effect sizes were larger for studies of plants than animals, and larger in studies conducted in areas with higher levels of radiation. Third, these negative effects of radiation on mutations, immunology and life history are inconsistent with a general role of hormetic positive effects of radiation on living organisms. Fourth, we reviewed studies of radiation resistance among taxa. These studies suggest that current levels of natural radioactivity may affect mutational input and thereby the genetic constitution and composition of natural populations. Susceptibility to radiation varied among taxa, and several studies provided evidence of differences in susceptibility among populations or strains. Crucially, however, these studies are few and scattered, suggesting that a concerted effort to address this lack of research should be made. © 2012 The Authors.

We have used the poorly immunogenic B16F10 melanoma model to characterize a very heterogeneous antitumor effect of the immune response induced by Treg depletion. Depletion and neutralization studies demonstrated the importance of host T cells and interferon γ (IFNγ) in mediating the antitumor response developing in Treg-depleted mice. Such a response correlated with increased proliferation of granzyme B- and IFNγ-producing T cells in the tumor. Furthermore, enhanced antitumor immunity modulated the expression of MHC Class I molecules by B16F10 melanoma cells in Tregdepleted mice. Since Foxp3+ Treg depletion induced a significantly heterogeneous antitumor response, for the first time we were able to assess antitumor immunity and autoimmunity across different groups of responding mice. Strikingly, the duration of the tumor-immune system interaction provoked in individual Treg-depleted mice positively correlated with their propensity to develop vitiligo. A rapid complete tumor rejection was not associated with the development of autoimmunity, however, a proportion of mice that suppressed, but did not effectively clear, B16F10 melanoma did develop vitiligo. The significant implication is that approaches that combine with Treg depletion to rapidly reject tumors may also diminish autoimmune toxicities. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.","Autoimmunity; Effector; Immune modulation; Suppression; Treg; Tumor immunity","diphtheria toxin; diphtheria toxin A; gamma interferon; granzyme B; Ki 67 antigen; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; T lymphocyte receptor beta chain; transcription factor FOXP3; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; antigen expression; article; autoimmunity; cancer inhibition; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; ex vivo study; host cell; immune response; immune system; immunomodulation; in vivo study; lymphocyte depletion; lymphocytic infiltration; melanoma; molecular dynamics; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; priority journal; prolonged immune response; regulatory T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor immune system interaction; tumor immunity; vitiligo"

While the adaptive functions of eumelanin are diverse, those of pheomelanin, which is phototoxic and whose production consumes a key intracellular antioxidant (glutathione), are not clear apart from being involved in color patterns that confer concealment. The factors that have favored the evolution of pheomelanin thus remain a mystery, causing this pigment even to have been considered an ""accident of nature."" A recent hypothesis posits that pheomelanin has evolved because it represents an alternative mechanism to remove excess dietary cysteine, which can be toxic because of its oxidation. We tested for links between pheomelanin-based color and survival in both an intraspecific study of barn swallows Hirundo rustica and an interspecific study of 58 species of birds from North and Central America. As predicted on the basis that birds degrade excess dietary amino acids by transferring their amino group to uric acid synthesis, we found that under equal levels of uric acid in plasma, individuals or species with a higher intensity or greater proportion of plumage colored by pheomelanin (brown and chestnut coloration) had higher relative annual survival rates while controlling for the potentially confounding effects of age, sex, body size, and phylogenetic descent. Likewise, barn swallows with more intense pheomelanin-based coloration had higher prospects to survive the winter after controlling statistically for age, sex, body size, and level of uric acid. This supports the idea that pheomelanic traits evolve because of the removal of excess cysteine in nonstressful conditions, thus avoiding its toxic effects. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

The objective of this study was to assess the therapeutic potential of an -GalCer-loaded tumor-cell vaccine against solid tumors in mice and to enhance the effectiveness of this approach by removing immune suppression associated with the activity of Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs). In the B16F10 melanoma model, we show that single vaccination with irradiated, -GalCer-loaded tumor cells resulted in suppression of established subcutaneous (s.c.) B16F10 tumor growth, which was mediated by NKT cell-dependent IFN-γ production and enhanced in the absence of IL-17 A. Selective depletion of Foxp3 + Tregs in transgenic DEpletion of REGulatory T cells (DEREG) mice led to significant inhibition of B16F10 tumor growth and enhanced survival of mice receiving vaccination. Short-term elimination of Foxp3 + Tregs (&lt;7 days) was sufficient to boost vaccine-induced immunity. Enhanced antitumor activity with combination therapy was associated with an increase in systemic NK cell and effector CD8+ T-cell activation and IFN-γ production, as well as infiltration of effector CD8+ T cells into the tumor. Overall, these findings demonstrate that transient depletion of Foxp3 + Tregs constitutes a highly effective strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer vaccination with NKT cell adjuvants. © 2013 Australasian Society for Immunology Inc.

Conservation practitioners and environmental managers struggle to identify and mitigate threats, reverse species declines, restore degraded ecosystems, and manage natural resources sustainably. Scientific research and evidence are increasingly regarded as the foundation for new regulations, conservation actions, and management interventions. Conservation biologists and managers have traditionally focused on the characteristics (e.g. abundance, structure, trends) of populations, species, communities, and ecosystems, and simple indicators of the responses to environmental perturbations and other human activities. However, an understanding of the specific mechanisms underlying conservation problems is becoming increasingly important for decision-making, in part because physiological tools and knowledge are especially useful for developing causeand- effect relationships, and for identifying the optimal range of habitats and stressor thresholds for different organisms. When physiological knowledge is incorporated into ecological models, it can improve predictions of organism responses to environmental change and provide tools to support management decisions. Without such knowledge, we may be left with simple associations. 'Conservation physiology' has been defined previously with a focus on vertebrates, but here we redefine the concept universally, for application to the diversity of taxa from microbes to plants, to animals, and to natural resources. We also consider 'physiology' in the broadest possible terms; i.e. how an organism functions, and any associated mechanisms, from development to bioenergetics, to environmental interactions, through to fitness. Moreover, we consider conservation physiology to include a wide range of applications beyond assisting imperiled populations, and include, for example, the eradication of invasive species, refinement of resource management strategies to minimize impacts, and evaluation of restoration plans. This concept of conservation physiology emphasizes the basis, importance, and ecological relevance of physiological diversity at a variety of scales. Real advances in conservation and resource management require integration and inter-disciplinarity. Conservation physiology and its suite of tools and concepts is a key part of the evidence base needed to address pressing environmental challenges. © The Author 2013.","Conservation physiology; Conservation science; Environment; Mechanisms; Resource management",

Fish were wild-caught from lakes in Illinois, and held in experimental ponds for the duration of the study. Between 9 and 13 days after cortisol treatment, and immediately prior to the start of the reproductive period, treated and control animals were sampled. Females exhibited lower muscle lipid content, lower liver glycogen content, and higher hepatosomatic indices than males, regardless of treatment. Also, cortisol-treated females had higher hepatosomatic indices and lower final mass than control females, whereas males showed no differences between treatment groups. Finally, cortisol-treated females had higher gonadal cortisol concentrations than control females. In general, we found evidence of reduced energetic stores in female fish relative to male fish, likely due to timing differences in the allocation of resources during reproduction between males and females. Perhaps driven by the difference in energetic reserves, our data further suggest that females are more sensitive than males to elevated cortisol during the period immediately prior to reproduction. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"hydrocortisone; animal; article; bass; blood; chemistry; drug effect; female; gonad; liver; male; physiological stress; physiology; pilot study; reproduction; sex difference; skeletal muscle; United States; Animals; Bass; Female; Gonads; Hydrocortisone; Illinois; Liver; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Pilot Projects; Reproduction; Sex Factors; Stress, Physiological; Animalia; Micropterus; Micropterus salmoides; Teleostei"

In the same period (20. dah), the PAN-RS strain showed significantly faster growth rate than the DAN strain in all the parameters measured in this study. In the case of the 13. dah of PAN-RS strain, they showed similar morphometries and growth rate with the DAN strain (20. dah).

All sperm traits (head length, midpiece length, tail length, and total length) varied significantly among populations. The variation among the European rustica populations was much lower than the differences among subspecies, indicating that sperm traits reflect phylogenetic distance. We also performed a test of the relationship between the coefficient of between-male variation in total sperm length and extrapair paternity levels across different populations within a species. Recent studies have found a strong negative relationship between sperm size variation and extrapair paternity among species.

Tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) is easier to apply but requires a 21-d withdrawal period. The lack of an immediate-release sedative approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) is a consequence of numerous factors, including the complexities of the approval process, the substantial human and monetary resources involved, and the specialized nature of the work. Efforts are currently underway to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of benzocaine- and eugenol-based products as immediate-release sedatives.

Although many quantitative models assume that larger, more fecund fish are preferentially removed by fishing, there is no empirical evidence describing the relationship between vulnerability to capture and individual reproductive fitness in the wild. Using males from two lines of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) selectively bred over three generations for either high (HV) or low (LV) vulnerability to angling as a model system, we show that the trait ""vulnerability to angling"" positively correlates with aggression, intensity of parental care, and reproductive fitness. The difference in reproductive fitness between HV and LV fish was particularly evident among larger males, which are also the preferred mating partners of females. Our study constitutes experimental evidence that recreational angling selectively captures individuals with the highest potential for reproductive fitness. Our study further suggests that selective removal of the fittest individuals likely occurs in many fisheries that target species engaged in parental care. As a result, depending on the ecological context, angling-induced selection may have negative consequences for recruitment within wild populations of largemouth bass and possibly other exploited species in which behavioral patterns that determine fitness, such as aggression or parental care, also affect their vulnerability to fishing gear.","Angler; Catchability; Evolutionary change; Recreational fisheries; Reproduction","aggression; article; fish; fish stock; fishery; fishing; largemouth bass; male; mating; nonhuman; parental behavior; priority journal; reproductive fitness; spawning; vulnerable population; Animals; Bass; Biological Evolution; Ecology; Female; Fisheries; Fishes; Male; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Phenotype; Reproduction; Selection, Genetic; Micropterus; Micropterus salmoides"

Various studies have examined the potential effects of future climate change on sockeye salmon, but there is currently no synthesis of the documented effects of climate on this species. In this paper, we present a synthesis of 80 peer-reviewed publications in the English language evaluating the effects of climate on sockeye salmon growth, phenology, and survival. The great majority of studies examined have been conducted with stocks from North America (90 % of studies). Survival (55 %) has been the most frequently studied aspect of the sockeye salmon life history in relation to climate, followed by growth (45 %) and phenology (30 %), with temperature (83.4 %) being the climate-related variable most frequently examined in such studies. Across life stages, the effects of climate-related variables have been most frequently studied on fry (36.3 %) and least studied on spawners (7.5 %). Our synthesis revealed that associations between temperature and growth, phenology, or survival have been uncovered for all the life stages of sockeye salmon, whereas relationships with other climate-related variables have been sparse. There is substantial evidence that sockeye salmon are influenced by thermal conditions experienced at regional, rather than ocean- or continental-wide scales, and that responses to temperature vary among and within stocks. The mechanisms by which climate affect sockeye salmon during the early stages in freshwater and while at sea are still poorly understood and warrant future research. More research on the effects of non-temperature, climate-related variables (e. g. stream flow, ocean pH), inter-generational and carry-over effects of climate, interaction between climate and non-climate stressors, and adaptation to climate change are also needed. Such information will be critical to advance our understanding of how sockeye salmon stocks will fare with future climate change. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Anadromous salmon; Climate warming; Cumulative impacts; Global warming; Salmonids; Thermal effects","climate change; climate effect; global warming; growth response; life history; phenology; salmonid; survival; temperature effect; North America; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus nerka; Salmonidae"

To make broad-level inferences about fish movement in lotic environments, we conducted random-effects meta-analyses on the effects of river flow magnitude on (i) non-migratory movements, (ii) upstream migratory movements, (iii) downstream migratory movements, and (iv) fine-scale activity. We found a significant positive effect of river discharge on non-migratory movements (r̄ = 0.41 (mean)± 0.07 (SE), Z = 6.06, p< 0.01, k (sample size) = 27); fishes made larger and (or) more frequent movements during periods of elevated discharge. Furthermore, non-salmonids were more affected by river flow than salmonids. River discharge also had a significant positive effect on the rate, frequency, and probability of upstream migratory movements (r̄ = 0.23± 0.10, Z = 2.24, p< 0.05, k = 8). However, the effect of discharge on the rate of downstream migratory movements (r̄ =-0.05± 0.15, Z =-0.35, p> 0.05, k = 5) and fine-scale activity (r̄ = 0.01± 0.11, Z = 0.08, p> 0.05, k = 5) were not significant. Heterogeneity of effect sizes was evident in all meta-analyses as well as inclusion and (or) publication bias.

However, the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in natural killer (NK) cell-mediated control of tumor immunity is poorly understood. Here, we show in a model of chemical-induced carcinogenesis and a series of experimental and spontaneous metastases models that mice lacking NLRP3 display significantly reduced tumor burden than control wild-type (WT) mice. The suppression of spontaneous and experimental tumor metastases and methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced sarcomas in mice deficient for NLRP3 was NK cell and IFN-γ-dependent. Focusing on the amenable B16F10 experimental lung metastases model, we determined that expression of NLRP3 in bone marrow-derived cells was necessary for optimal tumor metastasis. Tumor-driven expansion of CD11b+Gr-1intermediate (Gr-1int) myeloid cells within the lung tumor microenvironment of NLRP3-/- mice was coincident with increased lung infiltrating activated NK cells and an enhanced antimetastatic response. The CD11b+Gr-1int myeloid cells displayed a unique cell surface phenotype and were characterized by their elevated production of CCL5 and CXCL9 chemokines. Adoptive transfer of this population into WT mice enhanced NK cell numbers in, and suppression of, B16F10 lung metastases. Together, these data suggested that NLRP3 is an important suppressor of NK cell-mediated control of carcinogenesis and metastases and identify CD11b+Gr-1int myeloid cells that promote NK cell antimetastatic function. ©2012 AACR.",,"carcinogen; CD11b antigen; cryopyrin; CXCL9 chemokine; gamma interferon; RANTES; adoptive transfer; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; cell count; cell surface; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine release; immunoreactivity; lung infiltrate; lung metastasis; lymphocyte activation; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein depletion; protein expression; protein function; sarcoma; signal transduction; tumor immunity; tumor microenvironment; tumor volume; wild type; Adenocarcinoma; Animals; Antigens, CD11b; Carrier Proteins; Chemokine CCL5; Chemokine CXCL9; Fibrosarcoma; Inflammasomes; Killer Cells, Natural; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental; Melanoma, Experimental; Methylcholanthrene; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Myeloid Cells; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasms, Experimental; Prostatic Neoplasms"

We used electromyogram telemetry to monitor routine locomotory activity of artificially selected largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides in experimental ponds to test two potential explanatory hypotheses: (1) that the difference in angling vulnerability between high-vulnerability (HV) bass and low-vulnerability (LV) bass is related to a difference in routine activity level between the two groups, and (2) that the difference in vulnerability between HV and LV bass is related to a difference in the diel activity pattern displayed by each group (e.g., LV fish are more active at night, a time where there is typically little bass fishing effort). Neither hypothesis was supported by our results. Differences in vulnerability to angling in artificially selected lines of largemouth bass were not related to inherent differences in routine locomotory activity in our ponds. Mean daily activity levels were close to 5% of maximum swim speed in both groups, which we estimated to reflect a mean swimming distance of approximately 5,875 m (range = 1,280-9,670 m) per day. There was also no difference in the diel pattern of activity displayed by the two groups. Both HV and LV bass displayed a significant diurnal activity pattern: 16% and 19% higher activity levels during the day than at night, respectively.

We found differences in ageing patterns between populations. Generally, young (i.e. yearling) and old females (i.e. ≥ 5 years of age) laid their first eggs later and produced smaller clutches than middle-aged females (i.e. 2-4 years of age) in both populations. The southernmost population (i.e. Spanish) showing the shorter migratory distance experienced a greater within-individual increase in timing of breeding and clutch size in early life and a greater within-individual decrease in laying date but not in clutch size during senescence compared with the northernmost population (i.e. Danish). We also found that the number of fledglings produced annually was related to the age of the two members of the breeding pairs with pairs composed of young and old females performing less well than breeding pairs composed of middle-aged females. We did not find reproductive senescence for the age of the male while controlling for the age of the female on the number of fledglings produced annually by the breeding pair. Differential survival between individuals did not explain age effects on laying date or annual clutch size in neither population. However, the increase in the number of fledglings produced annually with age was partly explained by the disappearance of poor-quality members of the pairs, mainly poor-quality males. Age-related breeding success (i.e. number of fledglings) was similar for barn swallows from Spain and Denmark. Therefore, the study of ageing patterns and life-history strategies in free-ranging animals from more than a single population can throw new light on life-history theory, population dynamics and evolutionary studies of senescence. © 2012 The Authors.

Surprisingly, there are no standardized censuses of common animals in relation to radiation, leaving the question about the ecological effects of radiation unresolved. We conducted standardized point counts of breeding birds at forest sites around Chernobyl differing in level of background radiation by over three orders of magnitude. Species richness, abundance and population density of breeding birds decreased with increasing level of radiation, even after controlling statistically for the effects of potentially confounding factors such as soil type, habitat and height of the vegetation. This effect was differential for birds eating soil invertebrates living in the most contaminated top soil layer.

We aimed to boost antitumor immunity in B-cell lymphoma by developing a tumor cell vaccine incorporating (α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) that targets the immune adjuvant properties of NKT cells. In the Eμ-myc transgenic mouse model, single therapeutic vaccination of irradiated, (α-GalCer-loaded autologous tumor cells was sufficient to significantly inhibit growth of established tumors and prolong survival. Vaccine-induced antilymphoma immunity required NKT cells, NK cells, and CD8 T cells, and early IL-12-dependent production of IFN-γ. CD4 T cells, gamma/delta T cells, and IL-18 were not critical. Vaccine treatment induced a large systemic spike of IFN-(γ and transient peripheral expansion of both NKT cells and NK cells, the major sources of IFN-γ. Furthermore, this vaccine approach was assessed in several other hematopoietic tumor models and was also therapeutically effective against AMLETO9a acute myeloid leukemia. Replacing (α-GalCer with β-mannosylceramide resulted in prolonged protection against Eμ-myc lymphoma.

In order to investigate the modulation effect of heavy metals and to establish suitable biomarkers for the monitoring of heavy metal pollution, Pelteobagrus fulvidraco metallothionein gene was characterized as the first report in the family Bagridae. Pf-MT transcript was detected at high levels in liver, gonad, kidney, and brain compared to other tissues. A time-course study in response to waterborne Cd (5 ppm) revealed that a significant increase in the Pf-MT transcript abundance was observed at 6 h in gill, kidney, and liver. These elevated levels were kept for 96 h, implying that Cd distributed fast into different organs and was involved in the tissue-specific induction pattern. We observed a significant Pf-MT transcript increase in liver tissues at 48 h, followed by gill at 12 h and intestine at 48 h after Cd exposure. This indicates hepatic MT expression as a potential biomarker of acute Cd exposure in this species. Cd-binding ability of recombinant Pf-MT protein provided evidence for sensitivity to Cd and other heavy metal exposure. In the case of Zn exposure (1 ppm), a significant increase in Pf-MT transcript abundance was observed at 12 h, and a peak induction level reaching sixfold at 24 h was kept until 48 h, showing similar transcript induction patterns with Cd. A high level of Pf-MT mRNA after exposure to Cu (1 ppm) was observed at 12 h that gradually increased until 96 h with a 12-fold induction, revealing a long-lasting induction and somewhat dissimilar pattern compared to other metals in liver. Our results demonstrate that Pf-MT can be induced by heavy metals in a tissue-specific and metal-specific manner and plays probably a conserved role in metal detoxification.

Among these are the secretions by the exocrine uropygial gland in birds. The antimicrobial properties of uropygial secretions may prevent colonization and growth of microorganisms on feathers, skin and eggshells. However, uropygial gland secretions also favour the proliferation of feather mites that feed on secretions and microorganisms living on feathers that would otherwise reach eggshells during incubation if not consumed by feather mites. Therefore, at the interspecific level, uropygial gland size (as an index of volume of uropygial secretion) should be positively related to eggshell bacterial load (i.e. the risk of egg infection), whereas eggshell bacterial loads may be negatively related to abundance of feather mites eating bacteria. Here, we explore these previously untested predictions in a comparative framework using information on eggshell bacterial loads, uropygial gland size, diversity and abundance of feather mites and hatching success of 22 species of birds. The size of the uropygial gland was positively related to eggshell bacterial loads (mesophilic bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae), and bird species with higher diversity and abundance of feather mites harboured lower bacterial density on their eggshells (Enterococcus and Staphylococcus), in accordance with the hypothesis. Importantly, eggshell bacterial loads of mesophilic bacteria, Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae were negatively associated with hatching success, allowing us to interpret these interspecific relationships in a functional scenario, where both uropygial glands and mutualistic feather mites independently reduce the negative effects of pathogenic bacteria on avian fitness. © 2012 The Authors.

The ubiquitous presence of humans in urban areas selects for differential invasion by animals with short flight distances, and adaptation to urban environments results in further reductions in flight distance. Because prey are better able to cope with the proximity of humans than predators due to differences in flight distance, urban areas may act as refuges. Predators on average have a flight distance that is 8 times larger than that of their prey. In urban areas, humans were present within a distance of 54 m (the mean flight distance of raptor species) 16% of the time and 4% of the time within a distance of 7 m (the mean flight distance of prey species). In contrast, humans were present 1.2% of the time within a distance of 54 m but only 0.1% of the time within a distance of 7 m in rural habitats. Therefore, prey gained a 10-fold increase in predator refuge in urban compared with rural habitats. The reduction in flight distance between the ancestral rural and the current urban habitats decreased with the difference in flight distance between raptors and that of prey.

In this study, we used immune competent bone marrow chimeric mice and syngeneic orthotopic mammary cancer models to show that hypoxia in the primary tumor promotes premetastatic niche formation in secondary organs. Injection of mice with cell-free conditioned medium derived from hypoxic mammary tumor cells resulted in increased bone marrow-derived cell infiltration into the lung in the absence of a primary tumor and led to increased metastatic burden in mammary and melanoma experimental metastasis models. By characterizing the composition of infiltrating bone marrow-derived cells, we identified CD11b+/Ly6Cmed/ Ly6G+ myeloid and CD3-/NK1.1+ immune cell lineages as key constituents of the premetastatic niche. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells was significantly decreased, resulting in a reduced antitumor response that allowed metastasis formation in secondary organs to a similar extent as ablation of NK cells. In contrast, metastatic burden was decreased when active NK cells were present in premetastatic lungs. Together, our findings suggest that primary tumor hypoxia provides cytokines and growth factors capable of creating a premetastatic niche through recruitment of CD11b+/Ly6Cmed/Ly6G+ myeloid cells and a reduction in the cytotoxic effector functions of NK cell populations. ©2012 AACR.",,"CD11b antigen; gelatinase B; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; Ly6C antigen; lymphocyte antigen; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; bone marrow; bone marrow cell; breast cancer; cancer cell; cancer infiltration; cell lineage; controlled study; cytokine release; female; hypoxia; immune suppressor cell; immunocompetent cell; immunopathogenesis; lung carcinogenesis; lung metastasis; melanoma metastasis; mouse; natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity; nonhuman; priority journal; tumor hypoxia; tumor immunity; Animals; Antigens, CD11b; Antigens, Ly; Cell Hypoxia; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Female; Killer Cells, Natural; Lung Neoplasms; Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental; Melanoma, Experimental; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Precancerous Conditions"

Here, we analyzed the compact genome structure of the monogonont rotifer, Brachionus koreanus in the light of transphyletic genome comparison and economic genome usage. To confirm the genome compactness of B. koreanus, we compared the genomic structure of several selected genes with those of human and pufferfish. For example, one of the large genes, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) with dimeric protein Ku70 and Ku80, showed high similarity, even though genomic DNA lengths were quite different. The replication protein As (RPAs) as a heterotrimeric protein also showed a compact genomic structure including all the essential domains and motifs in B. koreanus. Regarding transmembrane protein-containing genes, the B. koreanus P-glycoprotein (P-gp) showed exactly the same topology of the TM domain compared to those of human and pufferfish, even though it had a compact genome structure. In addition, the gene structure of an inducible repair enzyme O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (O6-MGMT) of B. koreanus showed the highest compactness among the genes tested. The objective of this report is to evaluate the potential for whole genome sequencing and functional genomic research using the monogonont rotifer B. koreanus as a non-model organism that plays important roles in aquatic food-webs. Subsequently, we discussed possible reasons for compact genome structures as well as small and fewer introns from several perspectives. We conclude that the small size genome of B. koreanus would make this species potentially useful for comparative genome structure analysis of non-model species through whole genome sequencing and genetic mapping. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Brachionus koreanus; Gene structure; Genome; Monogonont rotifer","DNA dependent protein kinase; genomic DNA; glycoprotein P; Ku antigen; Ku80 protein; membrane protein; nucleic acid binding protein; replication factor A; unclassified drug; article; Brachionus koreanus; controlled study; food web; gene sequence; gene structure; genome analysis; nonhuman; priority journal; puffer fish; Rotifera; Amino Acid Motifs; Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Genes, Helminth; Helminth Proteins; Humans; Rotifera; Tetraodontiformes; Brachionus; Eukaryota; Tetraodontidae"

By comparing the transcriptomes of primary and metastatic tumor cells in a mouse model of spontaneous bone metastasis, we found that a substantial number of genes suppressed in bone metastases are targets of the interferon regulatory factor Irf7. Restoration of Irf7 in tumor cells or administration of interferon led to reduced bone metastases and prolonged survival time. In mice deficient in the interferon (IFN) receptor or in natural killer (NK) and CD8 + T cell responses, metastasis was accelerated, indicating that Irf7-driven suppression of metastasis was reliant on IFN signaling to host immune cells. We confirmed the clinical relevance of these findings in over 800 patients in which high expression of Irf7-regulated genes in primary tumors was associated with prolonged bone metastasisg-free survival. This gene signature may identify patients that could benefit from IFN-based therapies.

It is therefore important to identify alternative strategies, such as immunotherapies that can be used to control this refractory population. A CD44?CD24-/low subpopulation of cells within the B6 PyMT-MMTV transgenic mouse-derived AT-3 mammary carcinoma cell line was identified, which had CSC-like characteristics, including pluripotency and a resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy. Therefore, unlike xenograph models that require immunocompromised settings, this novel system may provide a means to study immune-mediated responses against CSC-like cells. The immunobiology of the AT-3 CSC-like cell population was studied by their surface molecule expression profile and their sensitivity to specified cell death pathways. Comparable levels of Rae-1, CD155, CD54 and higher levels of Fas and DR5 were expressed on the AT-3 CSC-like cells compared to non-CSC-like tumor cells. Expression correlated with an in vitro sensitivity to cell death by NK cells or through the ligation of the death receptors (Fas or DR5), by their ligands or anti-Fas and anti-DR5 mAbs. Indeed, compared to the rest of the AT-3 tumor cells, the CD44?CD24-/low subpopulation of cells were more sensitive to both Fas- and TRAIL-mediated cell death pathways. Therefore, despite the refractory nature of CSC to other conventional therapies, these CSC-like cells were not inherently resistant to specified forms of immune-mediated cell death. These results encourage the continued investigation into immunotherapeutic strategies as a means of controlling breast CSC, particularly through their cell death pathways. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Breast cancer; Cancer stem cells; Fas; Immunotherapy; TNF-related cell death; TRAIL","CD155 antigen; CD24 antigen; cell protein; death receptor 5; Fas antigen; Fas ligand; Hermes antigen; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; lymphocyte antigen; protein Rae 1; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; article; cancer stem cell; cell proliferation; cell subpopulation; cell survival; controlled study; female; in vitro study; mouse; natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; Animals; Antigens, CD24; Antigens, CD44; Antigens, CD95; Cell Death; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Flow Cytometry; Immunophenotyping; Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Radiation Tolerance; TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"

The authors measured reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and antioxidant enzyme activities with the endpoint hatching rate after gamma irradiation of different embryonic stages. Then, the transcriptional changes of antioxidant enzyme-coding genes were evaluated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in response to gamma radiation on embryonic stages. Gamma radiation inhibited hatching rate and caused developmental impairment in a dose-dependent manner. Embryos showed tolerances in a developmental stage-dependent manner, indicating that early embryonic stages were more sensitive to the negative effects of gamma radiation than were later stages. After 5 Gy rate of radiation, the ROS level increased significantly at embryonic stages 2, 3, and 4 with a significant induction of all antioxidant enzyme activities. The expressions of glutathione S-transferase isoforms, catalase, superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD), glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase mRNA were upregulated in a dose-and-developmental stage-dependent manner. This finding indicates that gamma radiation can induce oxidative stress and subsequently modulates the expression of antioxidant enzyme-coding genes as one of the defense mechanisms. Interestingly, embryonic stage 1 exposed to gamma radiation showed a decreased expression in most antioxidant enzyme-coding genes, suggesting that this is also related to a lower hatching rate and developmental impairment. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the molecular mode of action of gamma radiation in aquatic organisms. © 2012 SETAC.","Embryo; Gamma irradiation; Kryptolebias marmoratus; Oxidative stress","Antioxidant enzyme activity; Aquatic organisms; Cu/Zn-SOD; Defense mechanism; Developmental stage; Dose-dependent manner; Embryo; Embryonic stages; Fish embryos; Gamma irradiation; Glutathione peroxidase mRNA; Glutathione reductase; Glutathione-S-transferase; Isoforms; Kryptolebias marmoratus; Molecular mode; Reactive oxygen species; Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Super oxide dismutase; Transcriptional changes; Enzyme activity; Genes; Manganese; Oxidative stress; Oxygen; Peptides; Transcription; Gamma rays; catalase; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione reductase; glutathione transferase; manganese superoxide dismutase; messenger RNA; reactive oxygen metabolite; antioxidant; biological development; cyprinid; embryo; enzyme activity; gamma ray radiation; gene expression; hermaphrodite; irradiation; molecular analysis; oxidation; article; controlled study; developmental disorder; embryo; embryo development; enzyme activity; fish; gamma irradiation; gene expression regulation; Kryptolebias marmoratus; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression; radiation dose; radiation response; real time polymerase chain reaction; transcription regulation; upregulation; Animals; Antioxidants; Catalase; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Embryonic Development; Gamma Rays; Glutathione Peroxidase; Glutathione Reductase; Glutathione Transferase; Killifishes; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species; RNA, Messenger; Superoxide Dismutase; Kryptolebias marmoratus"

Inland commercial fisheries that use passive gears such as fyke nets cause the drowning of some freshwater turtles. To reduce fisheries impacts on turtles, bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) successfully implemented in marine systems may be adapted to freshwater systems. We tested the efficacy of two BRDs designed to exclude turtles from fyke nets by comparing catch rates and composition to unmodified nets. We also tested the efficacy of a BRD designed to let turtles escape the net by comparing turtle and fish escape capacities to a large hole in the net. The exclusion device with bars across the net opening significantly reduced turtle catch rates, and both exclusion devices did not affect fish catch rates. With the escape device, all turtles escaped (using painted turtles, Chrysemys picta, as an experimental model) and most (88%) fish were retained while a large hole allowed 60% and 77% of turtles and fish to escape, respectively. The escape device was the most effective for avoiding turtle bycatch mortality while retaining fish. Implementing the escape device or a combination of both exclusion and escape devices would reduce turtle bycatch mortality within fyke net fisheries. However, evaluations are needed to test the effectiveness of escape designs on additional turtle species and in different environments. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Bycatch reduction device; Commercial fisheries; Gear modification; Passive fishing gear; Turtle mortality","Chrysemys; Chrysemys picta; Testudines"

Our literature review revealed that ~65.5% of relevant peer-reviewed articles were found to focus on stranding associated with hydropower operations and irrigation projects. In fact, anthropogenic sources of fish stranding represented 81.8% of available literature compared to only 19.9% attributed to natural fish stranding events. While fish mortality as a result of stranding is well documented, our analysis revealed that little is known about the sublethal and long-term consequences of stranding on growth and population dynamics. Furthermore, the contribution of stranding to annual mortality rates is poorly understood as are the potential ecosystem-scale impacts. Mitigation strategies available to deal with stranding include fish salvage, ramping rate limitations, and physical habitat works (e.g., to contour substrate to minimize stranding). However, a greater knowledge of the factors that cause fish stranding would promote the development and refinement of mitigation strategies that are economically and ecologically sustainable. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Dewatering; Fish condition; Fish stranding; Hydropower; Regulated rivers","fresh water; anthropogenic effect; anthropogenic source; dewatering; drawdown; ecological impact; fish; flow regulation; freshwater ecosystem; hydroelectric power; ice flow; irrigation; literature review; long-term change; mitigation; mortality; stranding; substrate; wake; water level; aquatic environment; article; cold shock response; ecosystem; fish; flow rate; food web; habitat; hydropower; hypoxia; irrigation (agriculture); larval stage; mortality; nonhuman; population dynamics; turbidity; water availability; water quality; water temperature; Animals; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Fresh Water"

Delayed maturity and low natural adult mortality make turtles particularly susceptible to population declines when faced with additional anthropogenic adult mortality such as bycatch. When turtles are captured in fyke nets, the prolonged submergence can lead to stress and subsequent drowning. Fish die within infrequently checked passive fishing nets and dead fish are a potential food source for many freshwater turtles. Dead fish could thus act as attractants and increase turtle captures in fishing nets. We investigated the attraction of turtles to decomposing fish within fyke nets in eastern Ontario. We set fyke nets with either 1 kg of one-day or five-day decomposed fish, or no decomposed fish in the cod-end of the net. Decomposing fish did not alter the capture rate of turtles or fish, nor did it alter the species composition of the catch. Thus, reducing fish mortality in nets using shorter soak times is unlikely to alter turtle bycatch rates since turtles were not attracted by the dead fish. Interestingly, turtle bycatch rates increased as water temperatures did. Water temperature also influences turtle mortality by affecting the duration turtles can remain submerged. We thus suggest that submerged nets to either not be set or have reduced soak times in warm water conditions (e.g., >20 °C) as turtles tend to be captured more frequently and cannot withstand prolonged submergence. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","At-risk species; Bycatch mortality; Decomposition; Fyke nets; Inland commercial fisheries; Olfaction","At-risk species; By-catch; Commercial fisheries; Fyke nets; Olfaction; Decomposition; Ecology; Fish; Population statistics; Temperature; Water; Fisheries; bait; bycatch; commercial species; fish; freshwater ecosystem; inland fishery; mortality; population decline; submergence; trawl net; turtle; water temperature; animal trapping; article; autolysis; commercial phenomena; controlled study; environmental impact; feeding ecology; fish; fishery management; foraging behavior; freshwater species; mortality; nonhuman; species composition; trap fishery; turtle; water temperature; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Feeding Behavior; Fisheries; Fishes; Ontario; Population Dynamics; Turtles; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Testudines"

A compilation of adult migration papers from Fraser River sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka revealed a limited number of multivariable methods being applied and the sub-optimal reliance on univariable methods for multivariable problems. The literature review of fisheries science, general biology and medicine identified a large number of alternative methods for dealing with cumulative effects, with a limited number of techniques being used in fish migration studies.

Depletion of parental energy stores and declines in nutritional condition can cause physiological disturbances, such as an imbalance between free radical production and available antioxidants, known as oxidative stress. Using the teleost smallmouth bass (. Micropterus dolomieu) as a model, we tested if the energetic challenge associated with sole paternal care was associated with oxidative stress. Blood samples from parental males were collected throughout parental care, during egg, embryo, and larval stages of offspring development, and assayed for both antioxidant capacity and oxidative damage. A reduction in oxygen radical absorbance capacity was observed during the parental care period, indicating a decrease in resistance to oxidative stress. Although no change was observed in the reduced:total thiol ratio, a significant increase in the concentration of both oxidized and total thiols occurred during the parental care period. No increase in the oxidative stress markers 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, protein carbonyls and lipid peroxides was observed. We concluded that oxidative stress did not occur as a result of parental care in the male smallmouth bass.

Species differ in mean and variance in FID, suggesting that species with a large variance in FID have individuals that take either small or great risks, whereas species with a small variance are composed of individuals that are homogeneous in their risk-taking behavior. Here, we investigate the correlations between interspecific variance in risk-taking behavior and habitat selection, breeding range and population size, dispersal, and life history. Greater between individual variation in risk-taking behavior for a given average level of risk taking would imply that more different habitats could be exploited, resulting in larger local and global population sizes and larger ranges. There should be a link between dispersal distances and FID because individuals of risk-averse species should encounter greater difficulties of finding suitable breeding habitats. High local and global population sizes should select for fast life histories with early age at first reproduction, high annual fecundity, low juvenile survival, and fast rates of senescence in species with variable FIDs. Finally, a greater diversity of habitat use should select for a longer reproductive season in species with more variable FIDs. Analyses of FIDs for 133 species of birds revealed results largely consistent with these predictions. Because risk taking correlates with other kinds of behavior that constitute a syndrome behavioral syndromes can play an important role in producing ecological syndromes (i.e., correlations between ecological traits). © 2012 The Author.","between individual variation in behavior; flight initiation distance (FID); population consequences of behavior; risk-taking behavior","bird; breeding season; breeding site; dispersal; fecundity; flight behavior; habitat selection; habitat use; individual variation; interspecific variation; life history; population size; predator; risk factor; Animalia; Aves"

Collectively, these threats have made riverine fishes some of the most threatened taxa on the planet. Although much effort has been devoted to identifying the threats faced by river fish, there has been less effort devoted to identifying the factors that may hinder our ability to conserve and restore river fish populations and their watersheds. Therefore, we focus our efforts on identifying and discussing 10 general factors (can also be viewed as research and implementation needs) that constrain or hinder effective conservation action for endangered river fish: (1) limited basic natural history information; (2) limited appreciation for the scale/extent of migrations and the level of connectivity needed to sustain populations; (3) limited understanding of fish/river-flow relationships; (4) limited understanding of the seasonal aspects of river fish biology, particularly during winter and/or wet seasons; (5) challenges in predicting the response of river fish and river ecosystems to both environmental change and various restoration or management actions; (6) limited understanding of the ecosystem services provided by river fish; (7) the inherent difficulty in studying river fish; (8) limited understanding of the human dimension of river fish conservation and management; (9) limitations of single species approaches that often fail to address the broader-scale problems; and (10) limited effectiveness of governance structures that address endangered river fish populations and rivers that cross multiple jurisdictions. We suggest that these issues may need to be addressed to help protect, restore, or conserve river fish globally, particularly those that are endangered. © Inter-Research 2012.","Connectivity; Conservation; Endangered fish; Large rivers; Threats","anthropogenic effect; conservation management; endangered species; environmental change; environmental protection; environmental research; environmental restoration; fish; governance approach; habitat fragmentation; species conservation; watershed"

However, there are no studies investigating the consequences of animal scarcity on seed set, seed consumption and seed dispersal at large geographical scales. We exploited the unprecedented scarcity of pollinating bumblebees and butterflies in the vicinity of Chernobyl, Ukraine, linked to the effects of radiation on pollinator abundance, to test for effects of pollinator abundance on the ecosystem. There were considerably fewer pollinating insects in areas with high levels of radiation. Fruit trees and bushes (apple Malus domestica, pear Pyrus communis, rowan Sorbus aucuparia, wild rose Rosa rugosa, twistingwood Viburnum lantana, and European cranberry bush Viburnum opulus) that are all pollinated by insects produced fewer fruit in highly radioactively contaminated areas, partly linked to the local reduction in abundance of pollinators. This was the case even when controlling for the fact that fruit trees were generally smaller in more contaminated areas. Fruit-eating birds like thrushes and warblers that are known seed dispersers were less numerous in areas with lower fruit abundance, even after controlling for the effects of radiation, providing a direct link between radiation, pollinator abundance, fruit abundance and abundance of frugivores. Given that the Chernobyl disaster happened 25 years ago, one would predict reduced local recruitment of fruit trees if fruit set has been persistently depressed during that period; indeed, local recruitment was negatively related to the level of radiation and positively to the local level of fruit set. The patterns at the level of trees were replicated at the level of villages across the study site.

Here, we firstly identified and characterized the P-gp (Bk-P-gp) gene in the rotifer, Brachionus koreanus. Bk-P-gp was highly conserved in genomic organization compared to the human P-gp gene. Messenger RNA expression of Bk-P-gp revealed that it would be regulated by temperature change via 14 heat shock response elements in its promoter region. Bk-P-gp showed a high similarity of motifs/domains compared to those of vertebrates in its amino acid sequences. To check whether Bk-P-gp would be inducible, we exposed B. koreanus to six pharmaceuticals including antibiotics for use in aquaculture and observed dose- and time-dependency on transcripts of Bk-P-gp for 24h over a wide range of concentration. Efflux assay and membrane topology supported its conserved function for transportation of a number of chemicals upon cellular damage. To reveal the effect of pharmaceuticals on the rotifer, we measured survival rate and population growth rate after exposure to six pharmaceuticals. In an acute toxicity test, both NOEC and LC 50 values for all the pharmaceuticals were high for 24h. ATP, CBZ, SMX, and TMP markedly inhibited the population growth of B. koreanus after exposure up to 100mg/L for 10 days. In this paper, we demonstrated that various pharmaceuticals can retard growth rate with up-regulation of the P-gp gene as a cellular defense system.

We studied the effect of parental exposure to radioactive contamination on offspring development in lesser marsh grasshopper Chorthippus albomarginatus. We used a geometric morphometric approach to measure fluctuating asymmetry (FA), wing shape and wing size. We measured time to sexual maturity to check whether parental exposure to radiation influenced offspring developmental trajectory and tested effects of radiation on hatching success and parental fecundity. Wings were larger in early maturing individuals born to parents from high radiation sites compared to early maturing individuals from low radiation sites. As time to sexual maturity increased, wing size decreased but more sharply in individuals from high radiation sites. Radiation exposure did not significantly affect FA or shape in wings nor did it significantly affect hatching success and fecundity. Overall, parental radiation exposure can adversely affect offspring development and fitness depending on developmental trajectories although the cause of this effect remains unclear.

To quantify the sub-lethal effects of longline capture in the commonly exploited Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi), 37 individuals were captured using standard, mid-water longlines. Hook timers provided hooking duration to the nearest minute. Once sharks were landed, blood samples were taken and used to measure a suite of physiological parameters. Control data were obtained by sampling an additional three unrestrained Caribbean reef sharks underwater at an established shark feeding site. The greatest level of physiological disruption occurred after 120-180min of hooking, whereas sharks exposed to minimal and maximal hook durations exhibited the least disturbed blood chemistry. Significant relationships were established between hooking duration and blood pH, pCO 2, lactate, glucose, plasma calcium and plasma potassium. Longline capture appears more benign than other methods assessed to date, causing a shift in the stress response from acute at the onset of capture to a sub-acute regime as the capture event progresses, apparently facilitating a degree of physiological recovery. Continued investigation into the physiological response of elasmobranchs to longline capture is vital for the effective management of such fisheries. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Blood chemistry; Capture stress; Carcharhinus perezi; Caribbean reef shark; Longline; Non-linear stress response; Parabolic stress response; Survivorship","calcium; glucose; lactic acid; animal experiment; article; blood carbon dioxide tension; blood chemistry; blood pH; blood sampling; calcium blood level; Carcharhinus perezi; controlled study; environmental exploitation; feeding; glucose blood level; lactate blood level; lethality; longline capture; longline fishery; nonhuman; physiology; potassium blood level; shark; stress; Animals; Caribbean Region; Restraint, Physical; Sharks; Species Specificity; Stress, Physiological; Carcharhinus perezi; Carcharhinus perezii; Chondrichthyes; Elasmobranchii"

In this article, we develop a population genetics model in order to identify the key parameters that control the maintenance of egg polymorphism. The model analyses show that egg polymorphism can be maintained either statically as an equilibrium or dynamically with frequency oscillations depending on the sensitivity of the host against unlike eggs and how the parasite targets host nests with specific egg phenotypes. On the basis of the model, we discuss egg polymorphism observed in parrotbills and other host species parasitized by the cuckoo.

We assessed nest environment and monitored individuals to quantify seasonal reproductive success. Finally, we measured circulating cortisol concentrations following a standardized stressor and circulating testosterone concentrations. Using general linear models, we found that poststress circulating cortisol concentrations were positively related to water temperature and were higher in fish nesting in the river than in the lake. Circulating testosterone concentrations were negatively related to water temperature and were higher in reproductively experienced fish. When considering the factors that influence reproductive success, we found that only parental size was positively related to current nest success. In summary, the results demonstrate that nesting environment is correlated with parental stress responses during parental care, while reproductive history and nesting environment are correlated with circulating androgen concentrations.

Here we suggest that these relationships and the signal function of eggshell coloration would affect the outcome of coevolution between avian brood parasites and their hosts in at least three different non-exclusive evolutionary pathways. First, by laying blue-green coloured eggs, cuckoo females may exploit possible sensory biases of their hosts, constraining the evolution of parasitic egg recognition, and thus avoid rejection. Second, because of the relatively high costs of laying blue eggs, cuckoo females may be limited in their ability to mimic costly blue-green eggs of their hosts because cuckoo females lay many more eggs than their hosts. Furthermore, costs associated with foreign egg recognition errors would be relatively higher for hosts laying blue eggs. Third, cuckoos may use coloration of host eggs for selecting individuals or specific hosts of appropriate phenotypic quality (i.e. parental abilities). We here explored some predictions emerging from the above scenarios and found partial support for two of them by studying egg coloration of European cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) and that of their 25 main hosts, as well as parasitism and rejection rate of hosts. Cuckoo hosts parasitized with more blue, green, and ultraviolet cuckoo eggs, or those laying more blue-green eggs, were more prone to accept experimental parasitism with artificial cuckoo eggs. In addition, coloration of cuckoo eggs is more variable when parasitizing hosts laying bluer-greener eggs, even after controlling for the effect of host egg coloration (i.e. degree of egg matching). Globally, our results are consistent with the proposed hypothesis that host egg traits that are related to phenotypic quality of hosts, such as egg coloration, may have important implications for the coevolutionary interaction between hosts and brood parasites. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.","Blue-green egg colour; Cuckoo parasitism; Host egg discrimination; Pigment limitation; Sensory biases; Sexual signals","brood parasitism; coevolution; color; egg; mimicry; nestling; parental care; passerine; phenotypic plasticity; pigment; recognition; signal; Aves; Cuculidae; Cuculus canorus"

In these different models, the effects of α-GalCer mainly relied on the establishment of a type I NKT cell-dependent immune cascade involving dendritic cell, NK cell, B cell, or conventional CD4 + and CD8 + T cell activation/regulation as well as immunomodulatory cytokine production. In this study, we showed that γδ T cells, another population of innate-like T lymphocytes, displayed a phenotype of activated cells (cytokine production and cytotoxic properties) and were required to achieve an optimal α-GalCer-induced immune response. Using gene-targeted mice and recombinant cytokines, a critical need for IL-12 and IL-18 has been shown in the α-GalCer-induced IFN-γ production by γδ T cells. Moreover, this cytokine production occurred downstream of type I NKT cell response, suggesting their bystander effect on γδ T cells. In line with this, γδ T cells failed to directly recognize the CD1d/α-GalCer complex. We also provided evidence that γδ T cells increase their cytotoxic properties after α-GalCer injection, resulting in an increase in killing of tumor cell targets. Moreover, using cancer models, we demonstrated that γδ T cells were required for an optimal α-GalCer-mediated anti-tumor activity. Finally, we reported that immunization of wild-type mice with α-GalCer enhanced the adaptive immune response elicited by OVA, and this effect was strongly mediated by γδ T cells. We conclude that γδ T cells amplify the innate and acquired response to α-GalCer, with possibly important outcomes for the therapeutic effects of this compound. © 2012 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.",,"alpha galactosylceramide; CD1d antigen; gamma interferon; interleukin 12; interleukin 12p35; interleukin 13; interleukin 18; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; ovalbumin; adaptive immunity; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; article; B cell lymphoma; B lymphocyte; bystander effect; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell mediated cytotoxicity; cellular immunity; controlled study; cytokine production; dendritic cell; gamma delta T lymphocyte; gene targeting; immune response; immunization; immunomodulation; innate immunity; lung metastasis; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; T lymphocyte activation; treatment outcome; tumor cell; tumor immunity; wild type; Adaptive Immunity; Animals; Antigens, CD1d; Carcinoma, Lewis Lung; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Galactosylceramides; Immunity, Innate; Interleukin-12; Interleukin-18; Killer Cells, Natural; Liver; Lung Neoplasms; Lymphocyte Activation; Lymphoma, B-Cell; Melanoma, Experimental; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Protein Binding; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta; Spleen; T-Lymphocytes"

Given that antitumor effects have correlated with increased host immune responses, we hypothesized that improved therapeutic outcomes may be achieved by using oncolytic virus (OV) in combination with a potent immune agonist reagent. In this study, we carried out a preclinical evaluation of a genetically engineered strain of oncolytic vaccinia virus (Vvdd) for its capacity to induce antitumor responses when combined with an agonist antibody (Ab) specific for the costimulatory molecule 4-1BB (CD137). In immune-competent syngeneic mouse models of cancer, this combination therapy significantly reduced the growth of established subcutaneous tumors relative to either treatment alone. Importantly, the development of pulmonary metastatic lesions was also reduced. Tumor growth inhibition was associated with increased numbers of CD11b + and CD11c + myeloid cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes, greater infiltration of CD8 + effector T and natural killer (NK) cells, and a more sustained presence of neutrophils at the tumor site. Depletion of T or NK cells or neutrophils reduced efficacy, confirming their contribution to an effective therapeutic response. We further extended this conclusion through results from IFNγ-deficient mice. In summary, our findings offered a proof-of-concept for a combinatorial approach to enhance the antitumor efficacy of an OV, suggesting a strategy to improve their use as an immunotherapeutic treatment for cancer. ©2012 AACR.",,"CD11b antigen; CD137 antigen; gamma interferon; glycoprotein p 15095; oncolytic virus; virotherapy agent; adaptive immunity; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; article; bone marrow cell; breast cancer; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer inhibition; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell death; cell viability; colon cancer; controlled study; distant metastasis; drug cytotoxicity; drug dose increase; drug efficacy; drug response; effector cell; host range; immune response; immunogenicity; innate immunity; lung metastasis; lymphocytic infiltration; metastasis potential; mouse; natural killer T cell; neutrophil; nonhuman; oncolytic virotherapy; priority journal; subcutaneous tissue tumor; tumor immunity; Vaccinia virus; Adaptive Immunity; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antigens, CD137; Cell Line, Tumor; Combined Modality Therapy; Immunity, Innate; Interferon-gamma; Lymph Nodes; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Neoplasms, Experimental; Oncolytic Virotherapy; Vaccinia virus"

Controlling this response requires co-operation between a multitude of immune cells that are in turn controlled by specific receptor-ligand interactions and cytokine networks. In the context of cancer, a major mechanism by which the immune system restrains disease is through the action of cytotoxic lymphocytes that include natural killer (NK) cells and CD8 T cells. Both of these cell types express a panoply of receptors that are able to control their responses in order to heighten the specificity of their effector function. An emerging class of such receptors on cytotoxic lymphocytes are a group of immunoglobulin superfamily members that interact with ligands of the nectin and nectin-like (necl) family. These receptors include CD226, TIGIT, CRTAM and CD96. This review will outline the immunobiology of these receptors, the contexts where their function is important, their role in tumour immunosurveillance, and how they may be utilised for therapeutic applications in cancer. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"cd226 antigen; CD96 antigen; glycoprotein; immunoglobulin receptor; monoclonal antibody; nectin; nectin like protein; protein CRTAM; protein TIGIT; protein TIGIT monoclonal antibody; unclassified drug; autoimmunity; cancer immunotherapy; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; human; immune response; immunosurveillance; in vitro study; in vivo study; malignant neoplastic disease; natural killer cell; nonhuman; protein binding; protein domain; protein function; protein interaction; review; Animals; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Humans; Immunotherapy; Monitoring, Immunologic; Neoplasms"

In fish, pituitary growth hormone (GH) regulates physiological functions including adaptation to different salinity as well as somatic growth. GH is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and exerts its function via binding to growth hormone receptor (GHR). As Kryptolebias marmoratus is a euryhaline fish, this species would be a useful model species for studying the adaptation to osmotic stress conditions. Here, we cloned GH, -GHR, somatolactin (SL), and somatolactin receptor (SLR) genes, and analyzed their expression patterns in different tissues and during early developmental stages by using real-time RT-PCR. We also further examined expression of them after acclimation to different salinity. Tissue distribution studies revealed that Km-GH and -SL mRNAs were remarkably expressed in brain and pituitary, whereas Km-GHR and -SLR mRNAs were predominantly expressed in liver, followed by gonad, muscle, pituitary, and brain. During embryonic developmental stages, the expression of their mRNA was increased at stage 3 (9. dpf). The Km-GH and -SL mRNA transcripts were constantly elevated until stage 5 (5. h post hatch), whereas Km-GHR and -SLR mRNA levels decreased at this stage. After we transferred K. marmoratus from control (12. psu) to hyper-osmotic condition (hyperseawater, HSW; 33. psu), Km-GH, -SL, and GHR mRNA levels were enhanced. In hypo-osmotic conditions like freshwater (FW), Km-GH and -SL expressions were modulated 24. h after exposure, and Km-SLR transcripts were significantly upregulated. This finding suggests that Km-GH and -SL may be involved in the osmoregulatory mechanism under hyper-osmotic as well as hypo-osmotic stress. This is the first report on transcriptional modulation and relationship of GH, GHR, SL, and SLR during early development and after salinity stress. This study will be helpful to a better understanding on molecular mechanisms of adaptation response to salt stress in euryhaline fish. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..","Fish; Growth hormone; Growth hormone receptor; Kryptolebias marmoratus; Salinity; Somatolactin; Somatolactin receptor","growth hormone; growth hormone receptor; growth hormone releasing factor; messenger RNA; somatolactin; somatolactin receptor; unclassified drug; acclimatization; article; brain; cloning; controlled study; embryo development; fish; genetic transcription; gonad; hermaphroditic species; hypoosmotic stress; hypophysis; Kryptolebias marmoratus; liver; modulation; muscle; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; osmoregulation; protein expression; salt stress; salt tolerance; tissue distribution; upregulation; Acclimatization; Animals; Cloning, Molecular; Cyprinodontiformes; Fish Proteins; Fresh Water; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Glycoproteins; Growth Hormone; Hermaphroditic Organisms; Pituitary Hormones; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Receptors, Somatotropin; RNA, Messenger; Salinity; Seawater; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Analysis, Protein; Stress, Physiological; Tissue Distribution; Water-Electrolyte Balance; Kryptolebias marmoratus"

Scientific literature was reviewed to quantify the number and type of studies that have investigated behaviour and survival of anadromous forms of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brown trout (Salmo trutta), steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii). We examined three categories of tags including electronic (e.g. acoustic, radio, archival), passive (e.g. external marks, Carlin, coded wire, passive integrated transponder [PIT]), and biological (e.g. otolith, genetic, scale, parasites). Based on 207 papers, survival rates and behaviour in marine environments were found to be extremely variable spatially and temporally, with some of the most influential factors being temperature, population, physiological state, and fish size. Salmonids at all life stages were consistently found to swim at an average speed of approximately one body length per second, which likely corresponds with the speed at which transport costs are minimal. We found that there is relatively little research conducted on open-ocean migrating salmonids, and some species (e.g. masu [O. masou] and amago [O. rhodurus]) are underrepresented in the literature. The most common forms of tagging used across life stages were various forms of external tags, coded wire tags, and acoustic tags, however, the majority of studies did not measure tagging/handling effects on the fish, tag loss/failure, or tag detection probabilities when estimating survival. Through the interdisciplinary application of existing and novel technologies, future research examining the behaviour and survival of anadromous salmonids could incorporate important drivers such as oceanography, tagging/handling effects, predation, and physiology. © 2012 Drenner et al.",,"acoustic tag; amago; anhydromous salmonid; animal behavior; Atlantic salmon; brown trout; coded wire tag; controlled study; cuttthroat trout; external tag; life cycle stage; marine environment; nonhuman; Pacific salmon; population; review; salmonid; steelhead; survival rate; tagging; temperature; animal; ecosystem; ethology; growth, development and aging; meta analysis; methodology; physiology; salmonid; species difference; survival; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus clarkii; Oncorhynchus masou; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Oncorhynchus rhodurus; Salmo salar; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae; sea water; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Ecosystem; Ethology; Salmonidae; Seawater; Species Specificity; Survival Analysis"

To identify and characterize OGG1 gene (TJ-OGG1) in the copepod Tigriopus japonicus, the full-length cDNA sequence, genomic structure, and promoter region was analyzed. In addition, to investigate transcriptional change of TJ-OGG1 mRNA under oxidative stress conditions, T. japonicus were exposed to environmental oxidative inducers, H 2O 2, UV-B, and heavy metals (Cd, Cu, and Zn), respectively. The full-length cDNA of TJ-OGG1 gene was 1708 bp in length, encoding 343 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequences of TJ-OGG1 showed a 56% similarity with human. Two conserved motifs (HhH and PVD loop) and two conserved residues (lysine and aspartic acid) in active sites were also observed. TJ-OGG1 genome structure contained six exons and five introns and putative transcription factor binding sites such as Nrf-2, p53, ERE-half sites, and XRE were detected on the promoter region. TJ-OGG1 mRNA level was increased at approximately three-fold (P &lt; 0.05) at 1 mM and approximately 4-fold (P &lt; 0.01) at 10 mM of H 2O 2, respectively. UV-B enhanced the expression of TJ-OGG1 mRNA at 15 kJ/m 2 (P &lt; 0.05) and more (P &lt; 0.001). In a time-course experiment, TJ-OGG1 gene was highly transcribed within 12 h after exposure of 10 kJ/m 2 (P &lt; 0.01) and 20 kJ/m 2 (P &lt; 0.001). The expression of TJ-OGG1 mRNA after exposure to Cu and Cd for 96 h was significantly up-regulated at 0.1 μg/L and then remarkably reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Their transcript levels did not change at low dose (0.1 and 1 μg/L) but were dose-dependently down-regulated at high dose (10 and 100 μg/L). These findings suggest that H 2O 2, UV-B, and heavy metals induce oxidative stress and generate oxidatively damaged DNA. Consequently, the enhanced TJ-OGG1 gene expression would be associated with active involvement of TJ-OGG1 gene in DNA repair process as a cellular protection mechanism. This is the first report on the cloning and characterization of OGG1 gene in aquatic animals.

Higher numbers of low-quality territories with low reproductive success as density increases lead to a decrease in reproduction under the HHH, while more competition at high density decreases reproduction across all territories under the IAH. We analyse the influence of density and habitat heterogeneity on reproductive success in eight populations of long-lived territorial birds of prey belonging to four species. Sufficient reliability in distinguishing between population-wide, site-specific and individual quality effects on reproduction was granted through the minimal duration of 20years of all data sets and the ability to control for individual quality in five of them. Density increased in five populations but reproduction did not decrease in these. Territory occupancy as a surrogate of territory quality correlated positively with reproductive success but only significantly so in large data sets with more than 100 territories. Reproductive success was always best explained by measures of territory quality in multivariate models. Direct or delayed (t-1) population density entered very few of the best models. Mixed models controlling for individual quality showed an increasing reproductive performance in older individuals and in those laying earlier, but measures of territory quality were also always retained in the best models. We find strong support for the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis but weak support for the individual adjustment hypothesis. Both individual and site characteristics are crucial for reproductive performance in long-lived birds. Proportional occupancy of territories enables recognition of high-quality territories as preferential conservation targets. © 2011 The Authors.

Recently, extensive gene information has been identified from the intertidal copepod, Tigriopus japonicus. Here, we developed a 55 K (54,254 genes) oligomicroarray and tested its usefulness to identify the effect of single dose of UV-B irradiation (12 kJ/m 2) on transcriptomes of the copepod T. japonicus. A total of 35,361 spots were identified to be significantly modulated on the 55 K oligomicroarray by hierarchical clustering after exposure to UV-B irradiation over 48 h (6, 12, 24, and 48 h). Of them, 1300 and 588 genes were observed to be up-regulated and down-regulated at all time points, respectively. Particularly, it was observed that several genes involved in DNA repair mechanism were significantly modulated in the UV-B-exposed T. japonicus by microarray and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis. In detail, UV-B irradiation specifically up-regulated some genes in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), base excision repair (BER), and mismatch repair (MMR) pathways. On the other hand, a majority of down-regulated genes were representatives for the nucleotide excision repair (NER) mechanism. These results demonstrated that DNA damage would be induced by UV-B irradiation in this species, resulting in reliable induction or repression of various DNA repair mechanism on UV-B-induced DNA damage. In this report, we suggest that a high density microarray-based approach for risk assessment of UV-B irradiation would be useful to elucidate the mechanistic analysis in a non-model organism.

Even basic information on bycatch composition and mortality in freshwater is unavailable, given that few inland jurisdictions require reporting of bycatch. A small-scale inland hoop net fishery that targets pan fish (e.g. sunfish, Lepomis spp.) and operates primarily in the spring and fall was simulated in two lakes in south-eastern Ontario to characterize both bycatch composition and mortality. We fished one lake in both spring and fall to compare catch rates, while in the other lake we set nets for 2 or 6 days during the spring to assess fish mortality associated with different net tending frequencies. In both lakes, bycatch consisted of gamefish, turtles (including several species at risk), and mammals. For fish, there was no difference in spring and fall catches. Turtles, however, were captured more often in spring. Fish mortality of both target and non-target species increased from 0.3-0.9% to 3.0-3.7% (4-10 times) when set net duration increased from 2 to 6 days. Despite the provision of an air breathing space in our nets, we documented severe turtle mortality (33% in one lake) and all mammals died, suggesting that provision of air spaces is not always effective. Although all bycatch mortality is a concern, turtles are prone to population declines even with low levels of non-natural mortality. As such, regulators may consider limiting commercial fishing to the fall in this region to reduce turtle captures. Seasonal restrictions on fishing or use of frequent net tending (e.g. <2 days) will not prevent all turtle bycatch and therefore gear modifications should be investigated to further reduce turtle captures and mortality associated with hoop nets. © 2011 The Authors.

The origin of this phylum and the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of its modern classes remain mostly unknown, although scattered fossil evidence provides some insights on this topic. Here, we investigate the molecular divergence times of the major taxonomic groups of Cnidaria (27 Hexacorallia, 16 Octocorallia, and 5 Medusozoa) on the basis of mitochondrial DNA sequences of 13 protein-coding genes. For this analysis, the complete mitochondrial genomes of seven octocoral and two scyphozoan species were newly sequenced and combined with all available mitogenomic data from GenBank. Five reliable fossil dates were used to calibrate the Bayesian estimates of divergence times. The molecular evidence suggests that cnidarians originated 741 million years ago (Ma) (95% credible region of 686-819), and the major taxa diversified prior to the Cambrian (543. Ma). The Octocorallia and Scleractinia may have originated from radiations of survivors of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, which matches their fossil record well. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Cnidaria; Divergence times; Hexacorallia; Medusozoa; Mitochondrial genome; Octocorallia","transfer RNA; animal; Anthozoa; article; Bayes theorem; biological model; calibration; classification; fossil; genetic variability; genetics; jellyfish; mitochondrial gene; mitochondrial genome; molecular evolution; phylogeny; species differentiation; species extinction; statistical model; Animals; Anthozoa; Bayes Theorem; Calibration; Evolution, Molecular; Extinction, Biological; Fossils; Genes, Mitochondrial; Genetic Speciation; Genetic Variation; Genome, Mitochondrial; Likelihood Functions; Models, Genetic; Phylogeny; RNA, Transfer; Scyphozoa; Alcyonaria; Anthozoa; Cnidaria; Metazoa; Scleractinia; Scyphozoa; Zoantharia"

Recently, high-throughput sequencing technology has been proven to be a useful method for analyzing expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in non-model species. Thus, we have obtained extensive cDNA information by the pyrosequencing method, to utilize the polychaete species as a test organism for sediment quality monitoring studies. From the total RNA of P. nuntia, cDNA was reversely synthesized and randomly sequenced using a GS-FLX sequencer. In the assembly stage 1, 40,379 transcripts (13,666 contigs and 26,713 singletons) were acquired and showed 47% hitting rate compared with the GenBank non-redundant (NR) amino acid sequence database using BLASTX. After the stage-2 assembly, 21,657 transcripts were identified and showed 28% hitting rate. Finally, we obtained 6 064 unigenes that corresponded to the GenBank NR amino acid sequence database using BLASTX. Of the transcripts obtained in this species, we found a number of stress- and cell defense-related genes (e.g. heat shock protein family, antioxidant-related genes, cytochrome P450 genes) that are potentially useful for sediment monitoring at the molecular level, indicating that the pyrosequencing method is an effective approach to uncover gene families of potential biomarker genes simultaneously, and thus make transcriptomic studies possible. To confirm the usefulness of those potential biomarker genes, we analyzed the comparative profiling of P. nuntia mRNA transcripts between the samples collected from the polychaete aquaculture farm and the southern coast field of South Korea. In this paper, we summarize the expressed cDNA information of P. nuntia and discussed its potential use in environmental genomics and ecotoxicological studies for uncovering the potential molecular mechanisms of environmental stresses and chemical toxicity to the indicator species, P. nuntia in marine sediments. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Antioxidant; Biomarker; Ecotoxicology; EST; GS-FLX; Perinereis nuntia","biological marker; complementary DNA; contig; cytochrome P450; heat shock protein; messenger RNA; RNA; aquaculture; benthos; biomarker; coastal zone; cytochrome; database; ecotoxicology; environmental stress; gene; genomics; mitochondrial DNA; molecular analysis; polychaete; toxicity; amino acid sequence; article; controlled study; DNA synthesis; ecotoxicology; expressed sequence tag; gene; genomics; high throughput sequencing; nonhuman; Perinereis nuntia; priority journal; pyrosequencing; sediment; South Korea; stress; worm; Animals; Databases, Genetic; DNA, Complementary; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Monitoring; Expressed Sequence Tags; Gene Library; Genetic Markers; Geologic Sediments; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Polychaeta; RNA; Water Pollutants, Chemical; South Korea; Perinereis nuntia; Polychaeta"

Dorados Salminus brasiliensis (Characiformes) are large riverine piscivores that are targeted by recreational and commercial fishers and are considered regionally 'vulnerable' in Brazil due to overfishing, pollution, and habitat fragmentation. Here, we used radio telemetry to study the seasonal movements of dorados in the upper Uruguay River, Brazil, to provide the first information on large-scale migratory biology and to inform management and conservation actions. From November 2001 to July 2003, 73 dorados were radio-tracked using aerial surveys and 7 fixed radio telemetry stations installed in a section of the upper Uruguay River covering ~400 km. Despite use of an extensive radio telemetry array and aerial tracking, nearly 40% of fish tagged at the downstream site were never detected, suggesting unreported harvest, post-release mortality, or migration to tributaries or downstream reaches that extended beyond the tracking area, emphasizing the challenges of working in such a large study system in jurisdictions where research capacity and funding are limited. Nonetheless, this study yielded the first data on the migratory biology of dorados and revealed that a segment of the population is quite mobile and thus could be negatively impacted by river fragmentation, suggesting the need for management strategies that maintain connectivity (e.g. fish passage facilities). © Inter-Research 2011.","Dam Turvo; Forest Park; It; Migration upper; Radio telemetry; Salminus brasiliensis; Uruguay River","fish; habitat fragmentation; harvesting; mortality; overfishing; radiotelemetry; species complex; Brazil; Uruguay River"

The ""Five Freedoms"" approach to animal welfare was originally devised for farmed terrestrial animals, and has been applied in some countries to aquatic animals reared in aquaculture due to several commonalities inherent within food production systems. There are now moves towards assessing and addressing aquatic animal welfare issues that may arise in wild capture fisheries. However, all ""five freedoms"" are regularly contradicted in the natural environment, meaning this concept is inappropriate when considering the welfare of aquatic animals in their natural environments. The feelings-based approach to welfare relies on a suffering centered view that, when applied to the natural aquatic environment, requires use of value judgements, cannot encompass scientific uncertainty regarding awareness in fish, elasmobranchs and invertebrates (despite their unquestioned welfare needs), and cannot resolve the welfare conundrums posed by predator-prey interactions or anthropocentrically mediated environmental degradation. For these reasons, the feelings-based approach to welfare is inadequate, inappropriate and must be rejected if applied to aquatic animals in wild capture fisheries, because it demonstrably ignores empirical evidence and several realities apparent within the natural aquatic environment. Furthermore, application of the feelings-based approach is counterproductive as it can alienate key fisheries stakeholders, many of whom are working to address environmental issues of critical importance to the welfare, management and conservation of aquatic animal populations in their natural environment. In contrast, the function-based and nature-based approaches for defining animal welfare appear appropriate for application to the broad range of welfare issues (including emerging environmental issues such as endocrine disruption) that affect aquatic animals in their natural environment, without the need to selectively ignore groups such as elasmobranchs and invertebrates. We consider that the welfare needs of aquatic animals are inextricably entwined with the need for conservation of their populations, communities and their environment, an approach that is entirely consistent with the concept of ecosystem-based management. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Crustacean; Elasmobranch; Fish; Fisheries; Mollusc; Suffering; Welfare","animal welfare; anthropogenic effect; aquaculture; commercial activity; conservation management; ecological approach; ecological impact; ecosystem approach; environmental degradation; environmental issue; fishery modeling; Animalia; Crustacea; Elasmobranchii; Invertebrata; Mollusca"

We studied long-term trends in breeding phenology and reproductive success of a barn swallow Hirundo rustica population during 1971-2009 in relation to spring accumulated temperature (degree-days). Degree-days at the time of a phenological event constitute a more accurate and meaningful measure of the biological environment than mean temperatures over fixed time intervals, because accumulated temperature determines seasonal development, emergence and reproduction of many organisms, including the invertebrates on which species at higher trophic levels feed. Although laying dates showed an inverted U-shaped trend over time, degree-days at laying of first and second clutches increased linearly, suggesting that barn swallows are becoming increasingly ecologically mismatched relative to spring events. In addition, higher degree-days at laying were associated with smaller second clutches. These findings suggest that barn swallows are currently delaying reproduction relative to spring phenology, with negative consequences for their reproductive output. This delay may thus contribute to the population decline observed over the last decades. Degree-days at the time of reproduction may therefore provide a mechanistic link between phenology, breeding success and demographic trends of migratory bird populations. © Inter-Research 2011.","Degree-days; Ecological mismatch; Fecundity; Hirundo rustica; Phenology; Thermal delay","Degree-days; Ecological mismatch; Fecundity; Hirundo rustica; Phenology; Thermal delay; Biology; Climate change; Clutches; Forestry; Phenols; Population statistics; Ecology; accuracy assessment; bioaccumulation; breeding season; climate change; clutch size; fecundity; fitness; high temperature; migratory behavior; passerine; phenology; population decline; population structure; reproduction; reproductive success; temperature effect; trophic level"

Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were captured and subjected to a standard stress protocol and then stocked into a small research lake. Upon recapture by angling up to 1 year later (n = 26), fish were re-sampled following identical methods.

The purpose of this research was to investigate the physiological effects of TI on the juvenile lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris). Eight juvenile lemon sharks were subjected to four, three-hour treatments during which blood was sampled at 0, 30, 90 and 180. min, over a 6. week period. Treatments were differentiated by the method of maintaining the shark, either in TI, or allowed to swim freely between blood samples and the presence or absence of a pre-treatment exercise period designed to simulate the capture induced exhaustion that usually precedes the use TI in the field. The results suggest that TI is an inherently stressful experience, which magnifies the degree of perturbation observed in a number of blood chemistry parameters. It is thought that TI induced a short term reduction in ventilatory efficiency, which appeared to be countered by a series of compensatory mechanisms that include increased ventilation rates, and maintenance of the primary stress response.

The biological impacts including the conservation consequences of this event are still poorly known even 25years after the disaster. Here we assess the effects of this environmental disaster for conservation by focusing on two connected questions addressing the short-term ecological and the long-term evolutionary consequences: First, we pose the question of whether rare species are more impacted by radiation than common species? Second, what are the conservation consequences of elevated mutation rates due to the mutagenic effects of radionuclides from Chernobyl? Furthermore, we assess the extent to which ecological and evolutionary aspects interact. We censused breeding birds across 731 census points in Ukraine and Belarus during 3years to assess the relationship between abundance of different species and radiation. Most bird species avoided contaminated sites and individuals were concentrated in relatively uncontaminated sites. While common species were recorded at a wide range of radiation levels, rare species were restricted to the least contaminated sites and to sites with a high biodiversity. Thus, rare species were disproportionately impacted by the accident. Mutation rates of plants and animals have increased by up to a factor 20 due to release of radionuclides from Chernobyl. Given that each slightly deleterious mutation is expected to result in a selective genetic death, and that an average fruitfly under normal conditions may carry as many as 80 mutations, the number of mutations in animals and plants around Chernobyl and hence the number of selective deaths is bound to be much higher. There is empirical evidence for highly elevated mortality rates and dramatically increased rates of reproductive failure in contaminated areas, consistent with the expected high frequency of selective deaths due to mutations. The average slightly deleterious mutation is present for 33-167 generations in Drosophila, so if these estimates are qualitatively similar in other organisms, we can expect that mutants will disperse outside contaminated areas resulting in the spread of mutations well beyond the reach of contamination with radionuclides. Therefore, it should be possible to document the gradual spread of mutations from Chernobyl. We consider that the Chernobyl disaster and other nuclear releases may have significant consequences for population size and population viability of many species due to the large number of selective deaths. These effects remain to be investigated. Finally, comparative analyses of birds revealed that species with high mitochondrial DNA substitution rates had short dispersal distances, suggesting that mutations will spread relatively short distances when they are common, but will spread longer distances in species when they are rare. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Mutation; Mutational load; Radiation; Radioactivity; Selective mortality","biodiversity; bird; breeding site; Chernobyl accident; dispersal; fly; habitat conservation; mitochondrial DNA; mutation; nuclear explosion; nuclear power plant; phytotoxicity; population size; population viability analysis; radioactive pollution; rarity; spatiotemporal analysis; Central Europe; Eastern Europe; Animalia; Aves"

Many animals integrate climate change across a spatially and temporally dispersed annual life cycle, and effects are modulated by ecological interactions, evolutionary change and endogenous control mechanisms. Here we assess and discuss key statements emerging from the rapidly developing study of changing spring phenology in migratory birds. These well-studied organisms have been instrumental for understanding climate-change effects, but research is developing rapidly and there is a need to attack the big issues rather than risking affirmative science. Although we agree poorly on the support for most claims, agreement regarding the knowledge basis enables consensus regarding broad patterns and likely causes. Empirical data needed for disentangling mechanisms are still scarce, and consequences at a population level and on community composition remain unclear. With increasing knowledge, the overall support ('consensus view') for a claim increased and between-researcher variability in support ('expert opinions') decreased, indicating the importance of assessing and communicating the knowledge basis.

Pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) were intercepted upon arrival at the spawning grounds across three time periods. Pre-stress and stress-induced plasma cortisol concentrations were assessed in relation to behavior, longevity and reproductive success. Results revealed differences between sexes and with arrival time. The study period marked a year of high reproductive success and only nine females (12% of sample) failed to spawn. Female pre-spawn mortalities were characterized by significantly elevated stress-induced cortisol concentrations and decreased longevity as well as pre-stress cortisol above the normal range in pink salmon from the study area. Interestingly, reproductive behaviors were only associated with pre-stress cortisol levels. For females, aggression and mate interaction time were reduced in individuals with elevated pre-stress cortisol concentrations. In males, a similar negative relationship between pre-stress cortisol concentration and mate interaction time was detected. The observed behavioral correlations are likely a factor of social status where dominant individuals, known to have higher reproductive success, are characterized by lower cortisol levels relative to subordinate conspecifics.

Birds would be expected to respond to milder climatic conditions at their breeding grounds by reducing the length of their migration. Here, we exploit the largest ringing recovery database available for a longdistance migrant passerine bird, the barn swallow Hirundo rustica, spanning 1912-2008 and including recoveries from sub-Saharan Africa, to show that this species has shifted its wintering grounds northwards at a rate of 3 to 9 km yr -1. This shift occurred consistently in the 2 geographical clusters of barn swallows that could be identified on the basis of their migratory connectivity and could bedetected after accounting for possible differential changes in recovery probability among geographical areas. Analyses of trends in climatic conditions at the wintering grounds, based on time series of rainfall and temperature anomalies, showed that this northward shift should have caused a progressively larger proportion of barn swallows to winter in drier or warmer areas, i.e. where primary productivity is lower and therefore ecological conditions for wintering are less favourable. This shift, which may have contributed to the general decline in breeding barn swallow populations, may be due to the combined effects of selection for earlier arrival at the breeding grounds because of milder climatic conditions in the breeding areas, and constraints in other stages of the annual life cycle (e.g. timing of the annual moult) that prevent earlier departure from the wintering grounds. © Inter-Research 2011.","Barn swallow; Bird migration; Connectivity; EURING swallow project; Phenology; Wintering range","Barn swallow; Bird migration; Connectivity; EURING swallow project; Phenology; Wintering range; Biology; Population statistics; Recovery; Time series; Time series analysis; Climate change; arrival date; breeding site; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; connectivity; database; life cycle; long-term change; migratory behavior; migratory species; passerine; phenology; population decline; probability; range size; temperature anomaly; time series; Sub-Saharan Africa; Aves; Hirundo; Hirundo rustica; Passeriformes"

Fish selected for low vulnerability to angling captured more prey and attempted more captures than high vulnerability fish. The higher capture attempts, however, ultimately resulted in a lower capture success for low vulnerability fish.

Most tagged barracuda were transient and would often disappear from the array for months at a time, particularly in the summer where they were usually last detected on receivers located in deeper shelf habitats, and then return at other times in the year. Habitat use across the footprint of the array differed, with most detections occurring in coastal areas and comparatively fewer in deeper mosaic or shelf habitats. Linear home range estimates revealed that some barracuda moved >12 km within a single day and are capable of migrating >100 km to other islands in the Bahamian Archipelago.

This possibility predicts a negative relationship between probabilities of vertical transmission of symbionts and level of immune response that we here explore inter-specifically. We estimated eggshell bacterial loads by culturing heterotrophic bacteria, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and Enterobacteriaceae on the eggshells of 29 species of birds as a proxy of vertical transmission of bacteria from mother to offspring. For this pool of species, we also estimated innate immune response (natural antibody and complement (lysis)) of adults, which constitute the main defence against bacterial infection. Multivariate general linear models revealed the predicted negative association between natural antibodies and density of bacteria on the eggshell of 19 species of birds for which we sampled the eggs in more than one nest. Univariate analyses revealed significant associations for heterotrophic bacteria and for Enterobacteriaceae, a group of bacteria that includes important pathogens of avian embryos. Therefore, these results suggest a possible trans-generational benefit of developing a strong immune system by reducing vertical transmission of pathogens. © Springer-Verlag 2011.","Anti-bacterial defence; Bacteria; Complement; Natural antibodies; Trade-offs; Vertical transmission of microorganisms","bacterium antibody; complement; bacterial disease; cohort analysis; comparative study; disease transmission; eggshell; heterotrophy; immune response; infectious disease; innate behavior; multivariate analysis; pathogenicity; probability; symbiont; animal; article; bacterium; bird; blood; egg shell; Europe; female; humoral immunity; immunology; innate immunity; microbiology; Animals; Antibodies, Bacterial; Bacteria; Birds; Complement System Proteins; Egg Shell; Europe; Female; Immunity, Humoral; Immunity, Innate; Aves; Bacteria (microorganisms); Enterobacteriaceae; Enterococcus; Staphylococcus"

To assess the migratory responses to climate change, we need information on genetic constraints on evolutionary potential of arrival dates in migratory birds. Using two long-term data sets on barn swallows Hirundo rustica (from Spain and Denmark), we show for the first time in wild populations that spring arrival dates are phenotypically and genetically correlated with morphological and life history traits. In the Danish population, length of outermost tail feathers and wing length were negatively genetically correlated with arrival date. In the Spanish population, we found a negative genetic correlation between arrival date and time elapsed between arrival date and laying date, constraining response to selection that favours both early arrival and shorter delays.

Here, we cloned and sequenced the full-length cDNA and genomic DNA of two SODs from the copepod, Tigriopus japonicus: copper/zinc SOD (TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD) and manganese SOD (TJ-Mn-SOD). To define whether TJ-Mn-SOD is a cytosolic or a mitochondrial protein, a phylogenetic analysis was performed. The genomic structure of both TJ-SOD genes was determined with the promoter region sequences. In order to investigate their potential role in response to environmental pollutants, T. japonicus were treated with heavy metal (copper, zinc, and silver; 0, 10, 25, 50, and 100μgL -1) and industrial chemicals (benzo[α]pyrene, 4-nonylphenol, and tributyltin; 0, 1, 5, 10, and 20μgL -1) for 96h. Subsequently, the TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD and TJ-Mn-SOD mRNA level was measured with quantitative real-time RT-PCR along with total SOD activity. The deduced amino acid residues of TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD and TJ-Mn-SOD possessed evolutionary conserved domains that are required for metal binding and Cu/ZnSOD-conserved signature sequences. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that TJ-Mn-SOD was closely clustered to mitochondrial Mn-SOD of another copepod, Lepeophtheirus salmonis. TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD gene had four exons and three introns, while the TJ-Mn-SOD gene consisted of two exons interrupted by one intron. In the 5′-flanking region of TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD and TJ-Mn-SOD, we observed several transcription regulatory elements such as p53, XRE, MRE, and ERE-half sites. In the response to heavy metals, Cu, Zn, and Ag, both TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD and TJ-Mn-SOD transcript levels along with enzyme levels were significantly increased at high concentrations (50μgL -1 and 100μgL -1). Particularly, in the Cu- and Ag-exposed group, the expression of TJ-Mn-SOD mRNA was regulated more sensitively than the TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD mRNA level, indicating that the chemical susceptibility would be not correlated with the form of chemicals. B[a]P treatment showed a significant increase in the expression of both TJ-SODs mRNA level and enzyme level from 5μgL -1 concentration, while TBT decreased its expression at high concentrations (10μgL -1 and 20μgL -1). 4-NP increased both TJ-SODs mRNA level at 1μgL -1 concentration, and then inhibited its expression from 5μgL -1 concentration to a lower level than the control. This finding suggests that TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD and TJ-Mn-SOD would be an inducible gene upon exposure to heavy metals and B[α]P, and could be used as a potential biomarker for the risk assessment of these environmental pollutants. This is the first report to elucidate response of SOD to environmental pollutants in copepods. Therefore, this study would give a clue to better understand the mode of action of antioxidant genes and enzymes under oxidative stress in marine invertebrates. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","4-Nonylphenol; Benzo[α]pyrene; Copepod; Heavy metals; Superoxide dismutase; Tigriopus japonicus","4-Nonylphenol; Aerobic organisms; Amino acid residues; Antioxidant enzyme; Copepod; Cytosolic; Dismutase; Environmental pollutants; Flanking regions; Full-length cdna; Genomic DNA; Genomic structure; High concentration; Marine invertebrates; Metal binding; Mitochondrial protein; Mode of action; Molecular cloning; MRNA level; Phylogenetic analysis; Promoter region; Real time RT-PCR; Regulatory elements; Signature sequences; Super oxide dismutase; Superoxide dismutases; Superoxides; Tigriopus japonicus; Transcript level; Tributyltin; Amino acids; Cloning; Copper; Enzymes; Genes; Heavy metals; Hydrogen peroxide; Indicators (chemical); Industrial chemicals; Metals; Mitochondria; Molecular oxygen; Phenols; Plants (botany); Pollution; Polymerase chain reaction; Risk assessment; Silver; Transcription; Zinc; Manganese; complementary DNA; copper; genomic DNA; industrial chemical; manganese; mitochondrial protein; protein p53; silver; superoxide dismutase; zinc; antioxidant; biomarker; clone; crustacean; enzyme activity; gene expression; heavy metal; marine ecosystem; mitochondrial DNA; molecular analysis; phylogenetics; pollution effect; risk assessment; article; cloning; copepod; gene structure; intron; Lepeophtheirus salmonis; metal binding; phylogeny; pollutant; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Tigriopus japonicus; Animals; Base Sequence; Benzo(a)pyrene; Biological Markers; Cloning, Molecular; Copepoda; Gene Expression; Metals, Heavy; Molecular Sequence Data; Phenols; RNA, Messenger; Superoxide Dismutase; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Copepoda; Invertebrata; Lepeophtheirus salmonis; Tigriopus japonicus"

However, more extensive gene information is still needed to improve our understanding of the biology of this fish with respect to toxicological responses. We performed a transcriptomic study in this species using pyrosequencing. Liver and ovary mRNA was reverse synthesized into cDNA and randomly sequenced by a Roche 454, GS-20 sequencer. After quality assessment, the assembled expressed sequence tag (EST) translations were compared with the GenBank non-redundant (nr) amino acid sequence database using BLASTX. In the assembly stage 1, both 59,732 transcripts in liver and 103,526 transcripts in ovary were obtained. To identify the differently expressed genes in the ovary and liver tissues, all transcripts were sorted out with an expected value threshold of 1.00E-05. Consequently, 7168 contigs of ovary ESTs and 3855 contigs of liver ESTs were not overlapped for expression in both tissues, whereas 3763 contigs were commonly found in both tissues. Subsequently, we described the most highly represented genes in the liver and ovary of K. marmoratus. Isoforms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and receptor-related genes showed tissue-preferential expressed patterns. To identify the potential biomarkers in this species, ovary and liver ESTs were assembled and annotated with the nr amino acid sequence database using BLASTX. Then, 35,471 transcripts were obtained, and 9130 transcripts were hit (26%) at the assembly stage 2. Finally, we identified a number of stress-, antioxidant defense-, and DNA repair-related genes as potential molecular biomarkers for toxicological response using this species. We discuss the potential use for these markers in K. marmoratus for environmental genomics and eco-toxicological studies to uncover mechanisms of environmental stresses and chemical toxicities to K. marmoratus. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Following APC stimulation and cytokine release, NK cells produce interferon (IFN)-γ. High levels of LPS induce endotoxicosis, a systemic inflammatory disease in which IFN-γ causes significant morbidity and mortality. Several studies have highlighted the role of interleukin (IL)-18, IL-1Β, IL-17A and IFN-γ in the development of endotoxicosis, but whether these cytokines interact with each other is yet to be determined. Our data demonstrate that IL-18 and IL-17A have important roles in NK cell IFN-γ production during endotoxicosis. Importantly, we provide the first evidence that IL-18 also has a role in IL-17A production by T-cell receptor (TCR)-cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IL-18-deficient mice have a defect in γ T-cell homeostasis and IL-1Β production, both of which can contribute to the development of disease through induction of IL-17A.

A total of 26% of 103 passerine bird species in Europe had migratory divides that were located disproportionately often along a longitudinal gradient in Central Europe, consistent with the assumption of a Quaternary glacial origin of such divides in the Iberian and Balkan peninsulas followed by recolonization. Given that studies have shown significant genetic differentiation and reduced gene flow across migratory divides, we hypothesized that an absence of migratory divides would result in elevated rates of gene flow and hence a reduced level of local adaptation. In a comparative study, species with migratory divides had larger population sizes and population densities and longer dispersal distances than species without migratory divides. Species with migratory divides tended to be habitat generalists. Bird species with migratory divides had higher richness of blood parasites and higher growth rates of Staphylococcus on their eggs during the incubation period. There was weaker cell-mediated immunity in adults and stronger cell lysis in species with migratory divides. These findings may suggest that migratory divides constitute barriers to dispersal with consequences for ecology and evolution of distributions, population sizes, habitats and parasite-host interactions. They also suggest that migratory divides may play a role in local adaptation in host-parasite interactions. © 2011 The Authors.

In the teleost, steroid hormones are synthesized via the steroidogenesis pathway, and play a key physiological role in the regulation of gonadal sex differentiation. The protogynous hermaphroditic fish, Kryptolebias marmoratus is the only vertebrate capable of reproducing through internal self-fertilization. To uncover the effect of bisphenol A (BPA) on sex differentiation genes on transcription, we investigated the expression patterns of several sex differentiation-related genes such as dax1, dmrt1, mis, sf1, figlα, StAR and wt1 after BPA exposure with controls (E2 and TMX). In response to 17β-estradiol (E2) exposure, a testis-specific gene, dmrt1 mRNA was down-regulated in the gonad of the secondary male but the expression of the female-specific gene, dax1 mRNA was significantly elevated in the brain and gonad. A high level of StAR mRNA was detected in the brain and gonad of both hermaphrodite and secondary males, suggesting that the elevated expression of dax1 and StAR genes would be involved in E2 exposure. As expected, upon BPA exposure, the dmrt1 and MIS mRNA level decreased in both hermaphrodite and secondary males, while the female-specific gene, figlα mRNA level increased in the gonad of both genders. BPA showed an opposite mode of action on the expression of dax1 (induction, P> 0.05) and sf1 mRNA (inhibition, P> 0.05) in the brain and gonad against both genders. The sensitivity of dax1 to BPA on expression was relatively high in the secondary male. The wt1 mRNA was up-regulated in most tissues except in the liver of BPA-exposed secondary males. Regarding the time course study, the figlα mRNA level increased at 6. h after BPA exposure. In addition, BPA elevated the expression of StAR, dax1, and wt1 mRNA but repressed sf1 mRNA. In this paper, we demonstrated that BPA may modulate the expression of sex differentiation and steroidogenesis pathway genes, and this finding would provide a better understanding on the modulation of transcription upon BPA exposure in steroidogenesis and sex differentiation in the hermaphroditic fish, K. marmoratus. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Bisphenol A; Kryptolebias marmoratus; Sex differentiation-related genes; Steroidogenesis","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; DMRT1 protein; estradiol; factor in the germline alpha; Muellerian inhibiting factor; nuclear receptor DAX 1; steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; steroidogenic factor 1; tamoxifen; transcription factor; unclassified drug; WT1 protein; aquatic organism; endocrine disruptor; physiological response; pollution exposure; reproductive disorder; adult animal; animal experiment; article; brain; controlled study; dax1 gene; dmrt1 gene; down regulation; female; figl alpha gene; fish; gene expression profiling; gonad; hermaphroditism; juvenile animal; Kryptolebias marmoratus; male; mis gene; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; self fertilization; sex differentiation; sf1 gene; star gene; steroidogenesis; transcription regulation; wt1 gene; Animals; Cyprinodontiformes; Endocrine Disruptors; Female; Gene Expression; Male; Phenols; RNA, Messenger; Self-Fertilization; Sex Differentiation; Tamoxifen; Transcription Factors; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Kryptolebias marmoratus; Teleostei; Vertebrata"

The deduced amino acid sequence of Pn-GSTs showed a high similarity to those of other species that clustered into the same clades in a phylogenetic analysis. In addition, to evaluate Pn-GSTs as useful biomarkers on effects after cadmium (Cd) exposure, we exposed sublethal concentrations of Cd (5, 50, and 500 μg/L) to P. nuntia, and they showed relatively different but significantly increases, depending on exposure time and Cd concentrations.

Though studies of these effects on plants and animals are abundant, the study of how Chernobyl radiation levels affect prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities is practically non-existent, except for a few reports on human pathogens or soil microorganisms. Environments enduring extreme desiccation and UV radiation, such as sunlight exposed biofilms could in principle select for organisms highly resistant to ionizing radiation as well. Methodology/Principal Findings: To test this hypothesis, we explored the diversity of microorganisms belonging to the three domains of life by cultivation-independent approaches in biofilms developing on concrete walls or pillars in the Chernobyl area exposed to different levels of radiation, and we compared them with a similar biofilm from a non-irradiated site in Northern Ireland. Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria and Deinococcales were the most consistently detected bacterial groups, whereas green algae (Chlorophyta) and ascomycete fungi (Ascomycota) dominated within the eukaryotes. Close relatives to the most radio-resistant organisms known, including Rubrobacter species, Deinococcales and melanized ascomycete fungi were always detected. The diversity of bacteria and eukaryotes found in the most highly irradiated samples was comparable to that of less irradiated Chernobyl sites and Northern Ireland. However, the study of mutation frequencies in non-coding ITS regions versus SSU rRNA genes in members of a same actinobacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) present in Chernobyl samples and Northern Ireland showed a positive correlation between increased radiation and mutation rates. Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that biofilm microbial communities in the most irradiated samples are comparable to non-irradiated samples in terms of general diversity patterns, despite increased mutation levels at the single-OTU level. Therefore, biofilm communities growing in sunlight exposed substrates are capable of coping with increased mutation rates and appear pre-adapted to levels of ionizing radiation in Chernobyl due to their natural adaptation to periodical desiccation and ambient UV radiation. © 2011 Ragon et al.",,"ribosome DNA; ribosome RNA; ribosome RNA; spacer DNA; Actinobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; Amoebozoa; article; Ascomycetes; bacterium detection; Bacteroides; Bacteroidetes; Betaproteobacteria; biofilm; Chernobyl accident; ciliate; controlled study; cyanobacterium; Deinococcales; Deltaproteobacteria; DNA sequence; Gammaproteobacteria; green alga; ionizing radiation; Ireland; microbial community; microbial diversity; mutation rate; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; osmotic stress; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; Rubrobacter; single nucleotide polymorphism; sunlight; taxonomy; ultraviolet radiation; unindexed sequence; bacterium; classification; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; fungus; gene library; genetics; green alga; human; ionizing radiation; molecular genetics; mutation; radiation dose; radiation exposure; small ribosomal subunit; United Kingdom; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; Animalia; Ascomycota; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Chlorophyta; Deinococcales; Eukaryota; Prokaryota; Rubrobacter; Bacteria; Biofilms; Chernobyl Nuclear Accident; Chlorophyta; Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis; DNA, Intergenic; Fungi; Gene Library; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Northern Ireland; Phylogeny; Radiation Tolerance; Radiation, Ionizing; Ribosome Subunits, Small, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal; Sunlight"

Doxorubicin treatment enhances tumor antigen-specific proliferation of CD8 T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes and promotes tumor infiltration of activated, IFN-γ-producing CD8 T cells. Optimal doxorubicin treatment outcome also requires both interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-17 cytokines, as blockade of IL-1β/IL-1R or IL-17A/IL-17Rα signaling abrogated the therapeutic effect.

In tumor samples taken from breast cancer patients prior to treatment with anthracycline chemotherapy, a correlation between CD8α, CD8β, and IFN-γ gene expression levels and clinical response was observed, supporting their role in the therapeutic efficacy of anthracyclines in humans.

Pathogens may play an important role in the invasive process, facilitating colonization of their hosts in new continents and islands. According to the Novel Weapon Hypothesis, colonizers may out-compete local native species by bringing with them novel pathogens to which native species are not adapted. In contrast, the Enemy Release Hypothesis suggests that flourishing colonizers are successful because they have left their pathogens behind. To assess the role of avian malaria and related haemosporidian parasites in the global spread of a common invasive bird, we examined the prevalence and genetic diversity of haemosporidian parasites (order Haemosporida, genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) infecting house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We sampled house sparrows (N = 1820) from 58 locations on 6 continents. All the samples were tested using PCR-based methods; blood films from the PCR-positive birds were examined microscopically to identify parasite species. The results show that haemosporidian parasites in the house sparrows' native range are replaced by species from local host-generalist parasite fauna in the alien environments of North and South America. Furthermore, sparrows in colonized regions displayed a lower diversity and prevalence of parasite infections. Because the house sparrow lost its native parasites when colonizing the American continents, the release from these natural enemies may have facilitated its invasion in the last two centuries. Our findings therefore reject the Novel Weapon Hypothesis and are concordant with the Enemy Release Hypothesis. © 2011 Marzal et al.",,"article; avian malaria; biodiversity; controlled study; enemy release hypothesis; genetic variability; geographic distribution; Haemoproteus passeris; Haemosporida; host parasite interaction; host range; hypothesis; invasive species; mixed infection; native species; natural enemy; nonhuman; novel weapon hypothesis; nucleotide sequence; parasite identification; parasite migration; parasite prevalence; parasite vector; phylogeny; Plasmodium; plasmodium capistrani; polymerase chain reaction; sparrow; species invasion; animal; avian malaria; classification; genetics; parasitology; pathogenicity; sparrow; Aves; Haemoproteus; Haemosporida; Passer domesticus; Passeridae; Plasmodium (Apicomplexa); Animals; Haemosporida; Malaria, Avian; Plasmodium; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sparrows"

Although both resistance and tolerance of parasitism should evolve as a consequence of selection pressures owing to parasitism, the study of evolutionary patterns of tolerance has traditionally been neglected by animal biologists. Here, we explore geographical covariation between tolerance of magpies (Pica pica) and brood parasitism by the great spotted cuckoo (Clamator glandarius) in nine different sympatric populations. We estimated tolerance as the slope of the regression of number of magpie fledglings (i.e. host fitness) on number of cuckoo eggs laid in non-depredated nests (which broadly equals parasite burden). We also estimated prevalence of parasitism and level of host resistance (i.e. rejection rates of mimetic model eggs) in these nine populations. In accordance with the hypothetical role of tolerance in the coevolutionary process between magpies and cuckoos we found geographical variation in tolerance estimates that positively covaried with prevalence of parasitism. Levels of resistance and tolerance were not associated, possibly suggesting the lack of a trade-off between the two kinds of defences against great spotted cuckoo parasitism for magpies. We discuss the results in the framework of a mosaic of coevolutionary interactions along the geographical distribution of magpies and great spotted cuckoos for which we found evidence that tolerance plays a major role. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Egg rejection; Host-parasite interactions; Parasite resistance; Spatial coevolutionary interactions","brood parasitism; coevolution; egg; fledging; geographical variation; host-parasite interaction; parasite resistance; songbird; sympatry; tolerance; trade-off; animal; article; bird; evolution; female; genetics; host parasite interaction; nesting; parasitology; physiology; reproductive fitness; songbird; Spain; Animals; Biological Evolution; Birds; Female; Genetic Fitness; Host-Parasite Interactions; Nesting Behavior; Songbirds; Spain; Animalia; Clamator glandarius; Corvidae; Cuculidae; Pica pica"

Aquatic protected areas (APAs) are used to help maintain and even restore aquatic systems and their associated biota, including fish species that are popular with recreational anglers. Paradoxically, the use of APAs has been a source of much contention and conflict between members of the recreational angling community and those interested in or mandated to protect aquatic resources on the basis of the interests of multiple stakeholder groups. The angling community is concerned about the loss of fishing opportunities and effectiveness of APAs. Although it is still unclear whether establishment of APAs alone can effectively protect aquatic resources, actively including the recreational angling community in the design, implementation, and management of APAs will help ensure the values of this rather substantial user group are incorporated into aquatic conservation strategies.

Most movement studies addressed questions related to reproductive biology, effects of environmental factors on movement, stocking, and habitat use. Movement-related knowledge gaps were identified through the literature synthesis and a survey distributed to Great Lakes fisheries managers. Future studies on emigration/immigration of fishes through lake corridors, the dispersal of stocked fishes and of stock mixing were identified as being particularly important given their potential for developing lake- or region-wide harvest regulations and stocking strategies.

In this study, an hsp90 gene was isolated from disc abalone (Haliotis discus). The complete nucleotide sequence of the hsp90 gene contains an open reading frame of 2,184 base pairs, encoding an 84 kDa protein. Disk abalone hsp90 shares high sequence similarity with other hsp90 family proteins. Although the phylogenetic analysis did not classify it into the hsp90α group, the inductivity of this gene was confirmed by heat shock and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge test. Disk abalone hsp90 gene displayed a rapid and reversible induction response to both an exposure of typical heat shock and the LPS challenge. Once given the sublethal heat shock treatment, the transcription of disk abalone hsp90 gene was significantly up-regulated. With a recovery of 12 h, the transcription of disk abalone hsp90 gene gradually attenuated to the control level. These observations reflected the feedback regulation of abalone heat shock responses faithfully. In response to LPS challenge, the transcription of disk abalone hsp90 gene was significantly increased within 2 h and it approached maximum induction at 4 h later and recovered finally the reference level in 24 h. Take all together, the cloning and expression analysis of disk abalone hsp90 gene provided useful molecular information of abalone responses in stress conditions and potential ways to monitor the chronic stressors in abalone culture environments and diagnose the animal health status.","Disk abalone; Heat shock; hsp90; LPS challenge; Stress response","complementary DNA; heat shock protein 90; lipopolysaccharide; 5' untranslated region; abalone; amino acid sequence; article; base pairing; cellular stress response; controlled study; DNA sequence; feedback system; genetic transcription; Haliotis discus; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; phylogeny; protein expression; protein isolation; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; upregulation; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; Gastropoda; Gene Expression Regulation; HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Animalia; Haliotidae; Haliotis discus"

To uncover the role of the heat shock protein upon temperature stress and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exposure, we cloned heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) and determined its modulatory response under different temperatures and H2O2 concentrations. Under different temperature stresses (10 °C and 37 °C), the rotifer Brachionus sp. Hsp20 (Br-Hsp20) gene was highly expressed over time, and reached the maximum level 90 min after exposure, indicating that Br-Hsp20 gene would be involved in the chaperoning process to protect proteins at both low and high temperatures. To test the ability of thermotolerance of the recombinant Br-Hsp20-containing transformed Escherichia coli, we expressed the recombinant Br-Hsp20 protein with 1 mM IPTG for 18 h at 30 °C, exposed them at 54 °C with time course (10 to 60 min), and measured cell survival. In this elevated temperature shock (54 °C), the cell survival was significantly higher at the Br-Hsp20 transformed E. coli, compared to the control (vector only). To analyze the modulatory effect of Br-Hsp20 gene on oxidative stress, we initially exposed 0.1 mM H2O2 over time and measured antioxidant enzyme activities along with the expression level of Br-Hsp20 mRNA. Upon H2O2 exposure, Br-Hsp20 gene was time-dependently upregulated and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were also elevated at the 12 h-exposed group in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the Br-Hsp20 gene would be an important gene in response to oxidative and temperature stress.

The presence of melanin in testes has been anecdotally reported in all vertebrate groups, but the causes and functions of this melanin remain unknown. Similar to other extracutaneous melanins, testicular melanin may protect male germ cells from oxidative stress. Given the high respiratory activity of spermatozoa, oxidative stress generated by mitochondrial dysfunction as a consequence of mtDNA mutations directly affects sperm viability. Thus, natural selection may favour testicular melanization in males of species with high historical mutation rates in the mitochondrial genome. Here, we tested this hypothesis using information on occurrence of testicular melanization and mutation accumulation as reflected by cytochrome b mtDNA base pair substitution rates in a large set of 134 species of birds, controlling for the confounding effects of body mass, reproductive activity and phylogeny. We found that testicular melanization has evolved in species with high rates of accumulated mitochondrial mutations and propose that this is an adaptive response related to the protective capacity of melanin against oxidative stress. In support of this hypothesis, testicular melanization was more frequently observed during the breeding season of birds (i.e. when spermatogenesis is likely to occur) than during reproductive inactivity. In contrast to other extracutaneous melanins whose abundance seems to reflect skin and coat colour, we did not find a correlation between the proportion of plumage coloured by melanins and occurrence of testicular melanization. Whereas future experimental studies should test these hypotheses, our study highlights for the first time that melanization patterns in animals may evolve as a response to historical mutation rates. © 2011 The Authors.

In contrast, much less is known about the mechanism(s) for anti-carbohydrate responses to glycolipids, although it is generally considered that the CD1 family of cell surface proteins presents glycolipids to T cells or natural killer T (NKT) cells. Using model carbohydrate systems (isogloboside 3 and B blood group antigen), we examined the anti-carbohydrate response on glycolipids using both antibody neutralisation and knockout mouse-based experiments. These studies showed that CD4+ T cells were required to generate antibodies to the carbohydrates expressed on glycolipids, and unexpectedly, these antibody responses were CD1d and NKT cell independent. They also did not require peptide help.

They generate different colours and are synthesized under different physiological conditions. While pheomelanogenesis requires high levels of a key intracellular antioxidant (glutathione, GSH), eumelanogenesis is inhibited by GSH. This implies that species that present the molecular basis to produce large amounts of pheomelanin might be more limited to perform other costly processes that generate oxidative stress than species that produce eumelanin. Brain development requires large amounts of energy and antioxidants during ontogeny, so that large-brained species may be constrained in their simultaneous synthesis of large amounts of pheomelanin, but not in their synthesis of eumelanin. Here, we tested this hypothesis in a large dataset of 323 bird species. After controlling for the effects of phylogeny, latitude and sexual dichromatism, the proportion of pheomelanic plumage colour was strongly negatively related to the relative brain mass of species, whereas no relationship was found for the proportion of eumelanic colour. This indicates that the production of pheomelanin is a costly process that cannot evolve together with complex neural structures and thus with large cognitive capacity. This is the first time that the expression of melanic traits is found to correlate with another phenotypic character across species. © 2011 The Authors.

In the present study, we found that Polyinosinic:Polycytidylic Acid [Poly(I:C)] and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 [CpG], agonists for TLR 3 and 9, respectively, potently activated adoptively transferred T cells against a murine model of established melanoma. Intratumoral injection of Poly(I:C) and CpG, combined with systemic transfer of activated pmel-1 T cells, specific for gp10025-33, led to enhanced survival and eradication of 9-day established subcutaneous B16F10 melanomas in a proportion of mice. A series of survival studies in knockout mice supported a key mechanistic pathway, whereby TLR agonists acted via host cells to enhance IFN-γ production by adoptively transferred T cells. IFN-γ, in turn, enhanced the immunogenicity of the B16F10 melanoma line, leading to increased killing by adoptively transferred T cells. Thus, this combination approach counteracted tumor escape from immunotherapy via downregulation of immunogenicity.

Here, we hypothesize that an increase in oxidative stress accounts for the detrimental effects of prolonged high secretion of glucocorticoids. We performed a meta-analysis on studies where physiological stress was induced by administration of glucocorticoids to evaluate the magnitude of their effects on oxidative stress. Glucocorticoids have a significant effect on oxidative stress (Pearson r = 0.552), although this effect depends on the duration of treatment, and is larger in long-term experiments. Importantly, there was a significant effect on tissue, with brain and heart being the most and the least susceptible to GC-induced oxidative stress, respectively. Furthermore, effect size was larger (1) in studies using both sexes compared to males only, (2) when corticosterone rather than dexamethasone was administered and (3) in juveniles than in adults. These effects were not confounded by species, biochemical biomarker, or whether wild or laboratory animals were studied. In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that GC-induced oxidative stress could be a further mechanism underlying increases in disease susceptibility and decreases in Darwinian fitness observed under chronic stress. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Antioxidants; Brain; Corticosterone; Fitness; Free radicals; Oxidative damage","corticosterone; dexamethasone; glucocorticoid; aging; animal; brain; disease predisposition; drug effect; female; male; meta analysis; oxidative stress; physiological stress; review; secretion; vertebrate; Aging; Animals; Brain; Corticosterone; Dexamethasone; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Glucocorticoids; Male; Oxidative Stress; Stress, Physiological; Vertebrates; Animalia; Vertebrata"

However, the immune system can also promote tumor progression. Together, the dual host-protective and tumor-promoting actions of immunity are referred to as cancer immunoediting.

However, the molecular basis for the relationship between autophagy induction and the initial acquisition of malignancy is currently unknown. Here, we provide the first evidence that autophagy is essential for oncogenic K-Ras (K-RasV12)-induced malignant cell transformation. Retroviral expression of K-RasV12 induced autophagic vacuole formation and malignant transformation in human breast epithelial cells. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy completely blocked K-RasV12-induced, anchorage-independent cell growth on soft agar. Both mRNA and protein levels of ATG5 and ATG7 (autophagy-specific genes 5 and 7, respectively) were increased in cells overexpressing K-RasV12. Targeted suppression of ATG5 or ATG7 expression by short hairpin (sh) RNA inhibited cell growth on soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice. Moreover, inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with antioxidants clearly attenuated K-RasV12-induced ATG5 and ATG7 induction, autophagy, and malignant cell transformation. MAPK pathway components were activated in cells overexpressing K-RasV12, and inhibition of JNK blunted induction of ATG5 and ATG7 and subsequent autophagy. In addition, pretreatment with antioxidants completely inhibited K-RasV12-induced JNK activation. Our results provide novel evidence that autophagy is critically involved in malignant transformation by oncogenic K-Ras and show that reactive oxygen species-mediated JNK activation plays a causal role in autophagy induction through up-regulation of ATG5 and ATG7. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Autophagy; Epithelial cells; Human breast; In-cell; JNK activation; Malignant cells; Molecular basis; Nude mice; Pathway components; Pharmacological inhibition; Pre-Treatment; Protein level; Reactive oxygen species; Soft agar; Tumor formation; Up-regulation; Vacuole formation; Algae; Cell growth; Genes; Growth kinetics; Nucleic acids; Oxygen; Polysaccharides; RNA; Tissue culture; Ecology; autophagy protein 5; autophagy protein 7; Janus kinase; K ras protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; reactive oxygen metabolite; short hairpin RNA; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; autophagy; breast epithelium; cell growth; cell vacuole; controlled study; culture medium; enzyme inhibition; epithelium cell; human; human cell; malignant transformation; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene K ras; priority journal; protein expression; protein localization; signal transduction; upregulation; Animals; Autophagy; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Epithelial Cells; Female; Humans; Mice; Mice, Nude; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Reactive Oxygen Species; RNA, Messenger; Transplantation, Heterologous; Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes; Up-Regulation; Mus musculus"

The expression levels of several conventional HKGs, such as 18s rRNA, glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin, were significantly altered by the challenges, indicating that they might not be suitable internal controls.

Moreover, these three HKGs also showed the highest stabilities overall amongst different tissues, genders and EDC challenges. The expression of a biomarker gene, cytochrome P450 4B (CYP4), was also investigated and exhibited a significant increase after the challenges.

Using preclinical models of lymphoma, we have recently demonstrated that HDACi induce tumor cell-specific apoptosis and that this is essential for the therapeutic effects of these agents. Herein, we demonstrate that HDACi can be combined with immune-activating antibodies designed to promote the function of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and enhance proliferation and survival of cytotoxic T cells (CTL) to stimulate a host antitumor immune response resulting in eradication of established solid tumors. This unique combination therapy was dependent on tumor cell apoptosis mediated by HDACi that stimulated the uptake of dead tumor cells by APCs. Tumor eradication was mediated by CD8+ CTL that used perforin as the key immune effector molecule. This combination therapy was well tolerated and induced long-term immunological antitumor memory capable of mediating spontaneous tumor eradication upon rechallenge. These studies indicate that the ability of HDACi to mediate subtherapeutic levels of tumor cell apoptosis can be exploited by combining with antibodies that augment host antitumor immune responses to mediate robust and prolonged eradication of solid tumors.","Anticancer therapy; Epigenetic regulatory agent; Immunogenic cell death","autoimmune regulator protein; cd137 monoclonal antibody; CD40 ligand monoclonal antibody; gamma interferon; monoclonal antibody; perforin; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; unclassified drug; vorinostat; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antigen presenting cell; apoptosis; article; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell proliferation; cell survival; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; immune response; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; priority journal; solid tumor; tumor cell; tumor regression; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antigen-Presenting Cells; Combined Modality Therapy; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Hydroxamic Acids; Mice; Neoplasms, Experimental; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic"

We analysed extensive data on timing of reproduction by different host races of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus that is an obligate brood parasite laying eggs in the nests of many different species of passerine birds. Because different hosts breed at different times, specific host races of cuckoos have adapted to specific hosts by laying eggs when nests of these hosts are available, and such divergence may be further exaggerated by differences in timing of breeding among host races with similar habitat requirements. Host species accounted for a quarter of the variance in timing of breeding by the cuckoo. Common cuckoos reproduced at a similar, but narrower subset of dates as did possible hosts, showing that only a fraction of hosts with specific breeding dates were parasitized. Common cuckoo eggs laid in the 'right' kind of nests, phenotypically matching the eggs of the host, were laid later during the season than cuckoo eggs laid in the 'wrong' kind of nests where the eggs did not mimic those of the host. Pairs of sympatric cuckoo host races differed more in timing of breeding than pairs of allopatric host races, and pairs of cuckoo host races with similar breeding habitat differed more in breeding date than pairs of cuckoo host races with dissimilar habitat, as expected from reproductive character displacement. These findings are consistent with cuckoo host races being isolated by timing of breeding and habitat. © 2011 The Authors.

Cancer immunotherapy is a form of treatment that aims to improve the ability of a cancer-bearing individual to reject the tumor immunologically. However, antitumor immunity elicited by the host or by immunotherapeutic strategies, can be actively attenuated by mechanisms that limit the strength and/or duration of immune responses, including the presence of immunoregulatory cell types or the production of immunosuppressive factors. As our knowledge of tumor-induced immune suppression increases, it has become obvious that these mechanisms are probably a major barrier to effective therapy. The identification of multiple mechanisms of tumor-induced immune suppression also provides a range of novel targets for new cancer therapies. Given the vital role that a host's immune response is known to play in cancer progression, therapies that target immune suppressive mechanisms have the potential to enhance anticancer immune responses thus leading to better immune surveillance and the limitation of tumor escape. In this review, mechanisms of tumor-associated immune suppression have been divided into four forms that we have designated as (1) regulatory cells; (2) cytokines/chemokines; (3) T cell tolerance/exhaustion and (4) metabolic. We discuss select mechanisms representing each of these forms of immunosuppression that have been shown to aid tumors in evading host immune surveillance and overview therapeutic strategies that have been recently devised to ""suppress these suppressors."" © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Immune suppression; Immunotherapy; Inhibitory cytokines; MDSC; Tumor immunology","adenosine; arginase 1; cyclooxygenase 2; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; dioxygenase; indoleamine 2,2 dioxygenase; interleukin 10; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; nitric oxide synthase; programmed death 1 receptor; prostaglandin E2; transforming growth factor beta; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; article; B lymphocyte; bone marrow cell; cancer immunotherapy; human; immune response; immunosurveillance; metabolism; natural killer cell; nonhuman; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; Animals; Cytokines; Humans; Immune Tolerance; Immunity, Cellular; Immunotherapy; Neoplasms; T-Lymphocytes; Tumor Escape"

Electronic tagging studies provide information on the spatial ecology, behavior and survival of fish in marine and freshwater systems. However, any surgical procedure, particularly one where a laparotomy is performed and the coelomic cavity is opened, has the potential to alter the survival, behavior or condition of the animal which can impair welfare and introduce bias. Given that management, regulatory and conservation decisions are based on the assumption that fish implanted with electronic tags have similar fates and behavior relative to untagged conspecifics, it is critical to ensure that best surgical practices are being used. Also, the current lack of standardized surgical procedures and reporting of specific methodological details precludes cross-study and cross-year analyses which would further progress the field of fisheries science. This compilation of papers seeks to identify the best practices for the entire intracoelomic tagging procedure including pre- and post-operative care, anesthesia, wound closure, and use of antibiotics. Although there is a particular focus on salmonid smolts given the large body of literature available on that group, other life-stages and species of fish are discussed where there is sufficient knowledge. Additional papers explore the role of the veterinarian in fish surgeries, the need for minimal standards in the training of fish surgeons, providing a call for more complete and transparent procedures, and identifying trends in procedures and research needs.

Subsequently, efforts must be made to ensure the welfare of the fish are maintained and that fish do not experience significant mortality or sublethal impairments in health, behavior or physiology as a result of surgical procedures. Therefore, it is essential to adequately report information relating to all aspects of the surgical procedure to enable the reader to make an accurate interpretation of study results. We conducted a quantitative literature review aimed at characterizing trends in data reporting by examining a sample of fish telemetry studies published in peer-reviewed outlets during the last 20 years. We used a repeatability score, based on 16 predetermined criteria, to evaluate the reporting of surgical procedures in telemetry studies. The majority of studies failed to report basic information relating to the surgical procedures used. Repeatability scores were highly variable between studies and ranged from 0-93.8%. No single study provided complete information (mean repeatability score = 50.7%) and repeatability showed no trend over time. Some study information was consistently well reported (e. g. tag size and dimensions, the type of anaesthetic used and the location of incision). In contrast, the type of suture knots, duration or level of anaesthesia and precautions taken to minimize infection were consistently left out of the methods section of most telemetry studies. Our review was confounded by the large proportion of studies that cited other sources for their surgical methods, many of which themselves lacked complete information. We recommend that future electronic tagging studies that involve intracoelomic implantation include the minimum reporting standards presented in this paper. Increasing the detail of reporting will improve the quality of data presented, minimize welfare and ethical concerns and allow transparency for study repeatability. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Fish; Reporting; Surgical implantation; Tagging effects; Telemetry","biotelemetry; data quality; fish; literature review; quantitative analysis; standard (reference); tagging; trend analysis"

Here we summarize the trends in 108 peer-reviewed electronic tagging effect studies focused on intracoleomic implantation to determine opportunities for future research. To date, almost all of the studies have been conducted in freshwater, typically in laboratory environments, and have focused on biotelemetry devices. The majority of studies have focused on salmonids, cyprinids, ictalurids and centrarchids, with a regional bias towards North America, Europe and Australia. Most studies have focused on determining whether there is a negative effect of tagging relative to control fish, with proportionally fewer that have contrasted different aspects of the surgical procedure (e. g., methods of sterilization, incision location, wound closure material) that could advance the discipline. Many of these studies included routine endpoints such as mortality, growth, healing and tag retention, with fewer addressing sublethal measures such as swimming ability, predator avoidance, physiological costs, or fitness. Continued research is needed to further elevate the practice of electronic tag implantation in fish in order to ensure that the data generated are relevant to untagged conspecifics (i. e., no long-term behavioural or physiological consequences) and the surgical procedure does not impair the health and welfare status of the tagged fish. To that end, we advocate for (1) rigorous controlled manipulations based on statistical designs that have adequate power, account for inter-individual variation, and include controls and shams, (2) studies that transcend the laboratory and the field with more studies in marine waters, (3) incorporation of knowledge and techniques emerging from the medical and veterinary disciplines, (4) addressing all components of the surgical event, (5) comparative studies that evaluate the same surgical techniques on multiple species and in different environments, (6) consideration of how biotic factors (e. g., sex, age, size) influence tagging outcomes, and (7) studies that cover a range of endpoints over ecologically relevant time periods. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Behavior; Biotelemetry; Electronic tags; Surgery","behavior; biotelemetry; fish; literature review; physiology; tagging; Centrarchidae; Cyprinidae; Ictaluridae; Salmonidae"

Given that there was negligible information on this topic we embarked on a study where bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were used as a model to investigate the effects of different aseptic surgical techniques for the intracoelomic implantation of electronic tags in fish. First we tested the effects of water entry into the incision using five treatments: lake, distilled and saline water introduced into the incision, water-free controls, and non-surgery controls. For fish in the water treatments, 1 mL of the sample was introduced into their coelom prior to incision closure. Fish were held for 10 days to monitor survival and at the end of the study, the survivors were blood sampled and euthanized to evaluate condition and health using the health assessment index. In a second experiment, four aseptic treatments were used: non-sterile, field-based, high-grade sterility, and non-surgery controls and fish were monitored as in the first experiment. For both experiments, no differences in physiological status, health or mortality were noted among treatment groups. However, in the aseptic techniques experiment, surgical times were approximately twice as long for fish in the sterile treatment as compared to other groups and the costs of surgical supplies was greater than that of the less-sterile treatments. Although we failed to document any benefit of keeping water out of the incision or using aseptic technique for bluegill, in other situations and for other species, such approaches may be important. As such, we encourage fish surgeons practicing intracoelomic implants to attempt to prevent water entry into the coelom.

Therefore, normal development of the nervous system is jeopardized as reflected by high frequencies of developmental errors, reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities in humans. Alternatively, associations between psychological effects and radiation have been attributed to post-traumatic stress in humans. Methodology/Principal Finding: Here we used an extensive sample of 550 birds belonging to 48 species to test the prediction that even in the absence of post-traumatic stress, there is a negative association between relative brain size and level of background radiation. We found a negative association between brain size as reflected by external head volume and level of background radiation, independent of structural body size and body mass. The observed reduction in brain size in relation to background radiation amounted to 5% across the range of almost a factor 5,000 in radiation level. Species differed significantly in reduction in brain size with increasing background radiation, and brain size was the only morphological character that showed a negative relationship with radiation. Brain size was significantly smaller in yearlings than in older individuals. Conclusions/Significance: Low dose radiation can have significant effects on normal brain development as reflected by brain size and therefore potentially cognitive ability. The fact that brain size was smaller in yearlings than in older individuals implies that there was significant directional selection on brain size with individuals with larger brains experiencing a viability advantage. © 2011 Møller et al.",,"age; article; bird; body mass; body size; brain development; brain size; cephalometry; Chernobyl accident; controlled study; ionizing radiation; nonhuman; prediction; radiation dose; species difference; animal; bird; body weight; brain; cognition; female; head; histology; male; organ size; pathology; physiology; radiation exposure; radiation injury; radiation response; Ukraine; Animalia; Aves; Age Factors; Animals; Birds; Body Weight; Brain; Chernobyl Nuclear Accident; Cognition; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Female; Head; Male; Organ Size; Radiation Injuries; Ukraine"

Whether cuckoos are locally adapted for mimicking populations of the hosts on which they are specialized has never been investigated. In this study, we first explored the possibility of local adaptation in cuckoo egg mimicry over a geographical mosaic of selection exerted by one of its main European hosts, the reed warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus. Secondly, we investigated whether cuckoos inhabiting reed warbler populations with a broad number of alternative suitable hosts at hand were less locally adapted. Cuckoo eggs showed different degrees of mimicry to different reed warbler populations. However, cuckoo eggs did not match the egg phenotypes of their local host population better than eggs of other host populations, indicating that cuckoos were not locally adapted for mimicry on reed warblers. Interestingly, cuckoos exploiting reed warblers in populations with a relatively larger number of co-occurring cuckoo gentes showed lower than average levels of local adaptation in egg volume. Our results suggest that cuckoo local adaptation might be prevented when different cuckoo populations exploit more or fewer different host species, with gene flow or frequent host switches breaking down local adaptation where many host races co-occur. © 2010 The Authors.

Analyses quantifying the within-individual and among-individual components of phenotypic variation can help partition effects of phenotypic plasticity and selective mortality. We analysed phenotypic variation in the expression of a secondary sexual character, tail length, in male and female barn swallows Hirundo rustica from four European populations studied during 11-26 years, using linear mixed effect models to describe age-related expression. Tail length increased from yearlings to intermediate aged birds with a subsequent decrease at old age. In males, this age-related pattern was because of both within-subject and between-subject effects, with no difference among populations. Males having longer lifespan had shorter tails when young than those having shorter lifespan. Females showed similar patterns of age-related variation as males, with no difference among populations. The major difference between sexes was that the between-subject effects (i.e. disappearance effects or selection) were much more important for males compared to females for which lifetime variation in tail length was mainly because of a within-subject effect (i.e., a plastic response). These findings suggest that whereas males trade greater expression of the secondary sexual character at young age against longevity, that was not the case for females. This is consistent with tail length being more costly in males than in females, with the cost of long tails potentially being offset by elevated mating success, whereas that is not the case in females. © 2010 The Authors.

To understand the effect of UV-B radiation on the rotifer, Brachionus sp., several parameters including 24-h survival rate, population growth rate, and ROS level were measured after exposure to a wide range of UV-B doses. To check the expression of other important inducible genes such as replication protein A (RPA), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), Ku70, Ku80, and heat shock proteins (hsps) after UV-B radiation, we observed dose- and time-dependency at 2kJ/m 2. We also examined 13 hsp genes for their roles in the UV-B damaged rotifer. Results showed that UV-B remarkably inhibited the population growth of Brachionus sp. The level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was high at 2kJ/m 2, suggesting that 2kJ/m 2 would already be toxic. This result was supported by other enzymatic activities, such as GSH levels, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and glutathione reductase. For dose dependency, low doses of UV-B radiation (2, 4, and 6kJ/m 2) significantly up-regulated the examined genes (e.g. RPA, DNA-PK, Ku70, and Ku80). For the time course study, RPA genes showed immediate up-regulation but returned to basal or lower expression levels compared to the control 3h after UV-B exposure. The DNA-PK and Ku70/80 genes significantly increased, indicating that they may be involved in repairing processes against a low dose of UV-B exposure (2kJ/m 2). At the basal level, the hsp90α1 gene showed the highest expression, and followed by hsp10, hsp30, hsp60, and hsc70, and hsp90β in adults (w/o egg). In eggs, the hsp10 gene was expressed the highest, and followed by hsp30, hsp27, hsp90α1, and hsp60 genes. In real-time RT-PCR array on rotifer hsp genes, low doses of UV-B radiation (2 and 4kJ/m 2) showed up-regulation of several hsp genes but most of the hsp genes showed down-regulation at 8kJ/m 2 and higher, indicating that significant Hsp-mediated cellular damage already occurred at low doses. For the time course study of four hsp genes (hsp20, hsp27, hsp70, hsp90α1), they showed a significant correlation for UV-B radiation (2kJ/m 2). In this paper, we demonstrated that UV-B radiation would affect growth retardation with up- or down-regulation of some important genes in DNA replication, repair process, and chaperoning.

Substantial efforts were made to identify suitable and environmentally relevant models for toxicity testing. Rotifers have a number of promising characteristics which make them candidates worth considering in such efforts. They are small, simple in their organization, genetically homozygous, easy to cultivate. Rotifers are further widely distributed and ecologically important in freshwaters, in estuaries and coast, and also play an important role in the transportation of aquatic pollutants across the food web. In the last decades there has been a substantial increase of contributions on rotifers, particularly in areas of their ecology, geophylogeny, genomics and their behavioral, physiological, biochemical and molecular responses, following exposure to environmental chemicals and other stressors. Gene expression analysis enables ecotoxicologists to study molecular mechanisms of toxicity. Rotifers also appear as useful tools in the risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites that find their way into aquatic ecosystems because their sensitivity to some of these substances is higher than that of cladocerans and algae. In respect to endocrine disruptors, rotifers seem to be particularly sensitive to androgenic and anti-androgenic substances, whereas copepods and cladocerans are typically more affected by estrogens and juvenile hormone-like compounds. Generally, a combination of whole-animal bioassays and gene expression studies allow an understanding of toxicological mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to demarcate the potential of using rotifers as important invertebrate aquatic model organisms for ecophysiology, ecotoxicology and environmental genomics. This review does not claim to find reasons for a superior use of rotifers in these fields. But the different phylogenetic allocation of rotifers in the Platyzoa (formerly Nemathelminthes) justifies its consideration since there are evolutionary differences in biochemical and genetic performances that need to be considered. Problems, controversials and needs for further studies are discussed.

Circulating cortisol and androgens prior to and 25 min following a standardized 3 min emersion stressor were quantified for non-reproductive and parental fish across the parental care period. To experimentally investigate the influence of reproductive investment on endocrine parameters, we manipulated brood size (reduced, enlarged, sham-treated, or unmanipulated) 24 h prior to sampling parental fish. We predicted that fish guarding offspring would exhibit increased androgens and baseline cortisol levels, and an attenuated cortisol response to the stressor when compared with non-reproductive individuals. We further predicted that these effects would scale with reproductive investment. As predicted, parental care-providing fish exhibited lower post-stress plasma cortisol concentrations than non-reproductive fish. This difference was strongest early during parental care. However, no differences in baseline or post-stress cortisol concentrations were detected among parents guarding offspring with varying brood sizes. There was, however, a trend for parental fish to exhibit an increased cortisol response following brood manipulation, regardless of the direction of change in brood size, a response that likely reflected disturbance. No differences were found in baseline cortisol concentrations. Circulating androgens were found to be highest during early parental care, and no differences were found among parents guarding manipulated broods. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the endocrine stress response is affected by reproductive status, but the response in this model species does not appear to be scaled according to reproductive investment as predicted by life-history theory. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Androgens; Brood manipulation; Brood size; Cortisol; Offspring age; Offspring number; Parental care; Parental investment","androgen; glucocorticoid; hydrocortisone; animal experiment; article; controlled study; female; immersion; life history; male; nonhuman; parental behavior; Perciformes; prediction; priority journal; progeny; quantitative analysis; reproduction; stress; teleost; water temperature; Animals; Bass; Behavior, Animal; Clutch Size; Female; Hydrocortisone; Male; Reproduction; Stress, Physiological; Testosterone"

We used a combination of laboratory and field approaches to study the thermal biology of bonefish, Albula vulpes, a fish species that relies on nearshore intertidal habitats throughout the Caribbean. The critical thermal maximum (CTMax) for bonefish was determined to be 36.4±0.5 and 37.9±0.5 °C for fish acclimated to 27.3±1.3 and 30.2±1.4 °C, respectively, and these tolerances are below maximal temperatures recorded in the tropical tidal habitats where bonefish frequently reside (i.e., up to 40.6 °C). In addition, daily temperatures can fluctuate up to 11.4 °C over a 24-h period emphasizing the dramatic range of temperatures that could be experienced by bonefish on a diel basis. Use of an acoustic telemetry array to monitor bonefish movements coupled with hourly temperature data collected within tidal creeks revealed a significant positive relationship between the amount of time bonefish spent in the upper portions of the creeks with the increasing maximal water temperature. This behavior is likely in response to feeding requirements necessary to fuel elevated metabolic demands when water temperatures generally warm, and also to avoid predators. For fish held in the laboratory, reaching CTMax temperatures elicited a secondary stress response that included an increase in blood lactate, glucose, and potassium levels. A field study that involved exposing fish to a standardized handling stressor at temperatures approaching their CTMax generated severe physiological disturbances relative to fish exposed to the same stressor at cooler temperatures. In addition, evaluation of the short-term survival of bonefish after surgical implantation of telemetry tags revealed that there was a positive relationship between water temperature at time of tagging and mortality. Collectively, the data from these laboratory and field studies suggest that bonefish occupy habitats that approach their laboratory-determined CTMax and can apparently do so without significant sub-lethal physiological consequences or mortality, except when exposed to additional stressors. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Bonefish; Critical thermal maximum; Stress physiology; Temperature tolerance","glucose; lactic acid; potassium; Albula vulpes; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal food; article; Bahamas; coastal waters; controlled study; field study; fish; glucose blood level; habitat structure; heat sensitivity; heat tolerance; laboratory test; lactate blood level; low temperature; metabolic regulation; mortality; nonhuman; potassium blood level; predator avoidance; process monitoring; seashore; survival time; temperature acclimatization; temperature stress; tropic climate; water temperature; Albula vulpes; Albulidae"

Such challenges include recognizing the potential for carry-over effects, biotic factors, and multiple stressors when conducting fish kill investigations.

We also recommend additional efforts to develop databases for tracking fish kills, as well as more attempts to publish fish kill studies in the peer-reviewed literature.

Here, we cloned and sequenced the full-length O6-MGMT cDNA from the hermaphroditic fish, Kryptolebias marmoratus. Complete Km-O 6-MGMT cDNA was 1324 bp in length, and the open reading frame of 567 bp encoded a polypeptide of 188 amino acid residues. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Km-O6-MGMT was clustered with those of other fish species. Embryo, juveniles, and aged secondary fish had low levels of Km-O 6-MGMT mRNA than adults, indicating more susceptibility to DNA damage by alkylating agent exposure during these developmental stages. Km-O 6-MGMT mRNA levels differed according to tissue type and was highest in the liver. Exposure to an alkylating agent, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) exposure increased the mRNA expression of tumor suppressor gene such as p53 and oncogenes such as R-ras1, R-ras3, N-ras, c-fos as well as Km-O6-MGMT mRNA in a time-dependent manner. On the contrary, several (anti)estrogenic compounds (17β-estradiol 100 ng/L, tamoxifen 10 μg/L, bisphenol A 600 μg/L, and 4-tert-octylphenol 300 μg/L) suppressed mRNA expression of Km-O6-MGMT in most tissues, especially the liver. In juvenile fish, 17β-estradiol, bisphenol A, and 4-tert-octylphenol also decreased the expression of Km-O6-MGMT mRNA in a time-dependent manner. Overall, our finding shows that Km-O6-MGMT mRNA levels can be modulated by environmental estrogenic compounds as well as alkylating agents. This finding will be helpful to improve our knowledge of the effects of estrogenic compounds that contain the genotoxic ability to inhibit the DNA repair process in aquatic animals. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Kryptolebias marmoratus; N-methyl-N-nitrosourea; O6-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase","4 tert octylphenol; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; amino acid; complementary DNA; endocrine disruptor; estradiol; guanine; messenger RNA; methyl group; methylated DNA protein cysteine methyltransferase; methylnitrosourea; polypeptide; tamoxifen; alkylation; animal experiment; animal tissue; aquatic species; article; cell protection; controlled study; developmental stage; DNA damage; DNA repair; DNA sequence; fish; gene; gene cluster; gene expression; genotoxicity; Kryptolebias marmoratus; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; o 6 MGMT gene; oncogene c fos; oncogene N ras; open reading frame; p53 gene; phylogeny; priority journal; r ras1 gene; r ras3 gene; time; tumor suppressor gene; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Cyprinodontiformes; Endocrine Disruptors; Gene Expression Regulation; Hermaphroditic Organisms; Molecular Sequence Data; O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Animalia; Kryptolebias marmoratus"

Bonefish were found to exhibit relatively low activity levels in the field with no evidence of diel patterns or inter-sexual variation. Low activity levels reported by the accelerometers reflected low swimming speeds and intermittent swimming behaviours (i.e., swim-then-drift) that maximized energy efficiency. Such behaviours were also observed when conducting ethograms on bonefish held in a large field mesocosm. Laboratory derived standard metabolic rates and maximum metabolic rates during recovery from exercise were combined with acceleration transmitter calibrations to determine that individual bonefish typically operate at between 40 and 60% of their estimated metabolic scope in the field. However, occasionally acceleration values in the field were indicative of high intensity bursting activity that exhausted the majority of their estimated metabolic scope (0.7% of all field observations exceed 90% of estimated metabolic scope). Data gathered in this study provide a critical starting point for the development of a bioenergetics model for bonefish which will ultimately lend clues into how fish make a living in tropical tidal flats environments. Given that this paper is one of the first to use transmitters rather than archival loggers to collect data on tri-axial acceleration on fish, we also discuss the opportunities and limitations of using this new technology for marine fisheries research. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Acceleration transmitters; Activity; Albula vulpes; Ethogram; Telemetry","acceleration; accelerometer; bioenergy; calibration; energy efficiency; estimation method; fish; habitat type; intersexual interaction; marine environment; mesocosm; metabolism; observational method; swimming behavior; telemetry; tidal flat; Albula vulpes; Albulidae"

Previously, collection of acceleration data has been limited to archival loggers, necessitating retrieval of the devices; however, recent advances in biotelemetry have allowed for acceleration data to be transmitted to a remote receiver. To illustrate the application of this technology, relative locomotory activity and depth utilisation of adult great barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda) were monitored across habitat types and diel periods using acoustic transmitters equipped with tri-axial acceleration and pressure sensors within an acoustic telemetry array (n≤53 receivers) deployed in The Bahamas. Although there were no differences in acceleration or depth use across habitats or diel periods, there was evidence of movement into shelf habitat during mid-day where they occupied depths 10m. Given both the method of calculating the accelerometer output, and that the transmitters were unable to store and transmit large quantities of data, we suggest choosing transmitter settings with a short average delay and high transmission frequency to optimise data quality and resolution.

In the last few decades, biotelemetry has enabled scientists to track the movements of marine life across a variety of scales. However, the use of such technology is progressing faster than the analytical techniques for modeling movement patterns. In summer 2012, we deployed an acoustic telemetry array around Culebra, Puerto Rico, consisting of 48 remote receivers that can detect coded transmissions sent by tags implanted in fish. We surgically implanted transmitters in bonefish ( n= 28), great barracuda ( n= 2) and permit ( n= 1) as part of a multi-year study. In January 2013, we downloaded over 850,000 detections from 39 receivers for 31 fish (several receivers had zero fish detections, and two receivers were not downloaded), and used that six-month data set to explore how graph theory and network analysis can be used to model the movement ecology of the tagged fish. We analyzed this data as two types of graphs. First, a bipartite graph was constructed by linking each fish with an edge weighted by the number of detections of that fish by that receiver. Bipartite graphs are not explicitly spatial, but rather represent which fish associate with which receivers. Second, spatial movement graphs for individuals were built by linking receivers (nodes) by edges with the number of times each fish moved along that edge as weights. The bipartite graph identified groups of fish visiting the same sites, and groups of sites visited by the same fish. Of the six community detection algorithms used, Multilevel, Fast-Greedy, and Walk-Trap performed best, with similar module partitions and modularity scores. All three of these algorithms produced modules (groups) that appear to reflect working hypotheses related to the coastal bathymetry, habitat types, and associated movement ecology of the tagged species. Spatial movement graphs were very different for each fish examined and reflect behavioral differences. Fish exhibited various movement patterns, some showing the pattern of a central place forager (bonefish), while others cruised along a territory (great barracuda and permit). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.","Acoustic tagging; Bipartite graphs; Directed graphs; Fish movement; Social network analysis","Animals; Directed graphs; Ecology; Fish; Fisheries; Graphic methods; Social networking (online); Telemetering equipment; Acoustic telemetry; Bipartite graphs; Coastal bathymetry; Coded transmission; Community detection algorithms; Fish movements; Movement ecologies; Movement pattern; Graph theory; Pisces"

During an immune response, NK cells are exposed to complex combinations of cytokines that influence their differentiation and function. In this study, we have examined the phenotypic and functional consequences of exposing mouse NK cells to IL-4, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, and IL-21 and found that although all factors induced signs of maturation, characterized by decreased proliferation and IFN-g secretion, distinct combinations induced unique cytokine secretion profiles. In contrast, the immunosuppressive factors IL-10 and TGF-b had little direct effect on NK cell effector functions. Sustained IL-18 signals resulted in IL-13 and GM-CSF production, whereas IL-12 and IL-21 induced IL-10 and TNF-a. Surprisingly, with the exception of IL-21, all cytokines suppressed cytotoxic function of NK cells at the expense of endogenous cytokine production suggesting that ""helpertype"" NK cells were generated. The cytokine signals also profoundly altered the cell surface phenotype of the NK cells-a striking example being the downregulation of the activating receptor NKG2D by IL-4 that resulted in decreased NKG2D-dependent killing. IL-4 exposure also modulated NKG2D expression in vivo suggesting it is functionally important during immune responses. This study highlights the plasticity of NK cell differentiation and suggests that the relative abundance of cytokines at sites of inflammation will lead to diverse outcomes in terms of NK cell phenotype and interaction with the immune system.

In adoptive transfer studies, we demonstrated significant improvement in the survival of mice bearing Her-2+ 24JK tumor following administration of anti-Her-2 T cells compared with control T cells. The incorporation of a lymphoablative step prior to adoptive transfer of anti-Her-2 T cells and administration of IL-2 were both found to further enhance survival. The reduction in tumor growth was also correlated with localization of transferred T cells at the tumor site. Furthermore, an antigen-specific recall response could be induced in long-term surviving mice following rechallenge with Her-2+ tumor.

Using exogenous hormone implants, we raised circulating cortisol concentrations in a group of wild fish for approximately 5 d in October 2007. We then compared activity (velocity, distance traveled) of cortisol-treated animals with that of shamtreated and control animals throughout the winter using an automated acoustic telemetry array. Immediately following treatment, the cortisol-treated fish showed increased activity relative to controls.

To obtain a better understanding on the modulation of gonadotropin subunit genes expression upon bisphenol A (BPA) exposure in hermaphroditic fish, we studied differential regulation of gonadotropin subunit genes from Kryptolebias marmoratus after the exposure of several EDCs. Expression profiles of these three genes when using quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that brain/pituitary tissues were highly expressed in these genes compared to other tissues. At different developmental stages, expression of those genes dramatically increased over the course of development but showed a decrease in expression at the secondary male (showing atresia) stage. When adult fish were exposed to BPA (600 μg/L for 96. h), a significant upregulation of these three genes was observed in the brain/pituitary. A time course study also revealed the increased expression of gonadotropin subunit genes over 12. h with a more pronounced effect on the expression of FSH-β and LH-β genes, indicating that both genes were associated with the BPA exposure on the transcriptional regulation. This is the first report of gonadotropin subunit genes from K. marmoratus, with particular emphasis on the modulation of their expressions by EDCs. In addition, these findings suggest that EDCs modulate the expression of gonadotropin subunit genes and would act as potential biomarkers upon EDCs exposure. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","17β-Estradiol; Bisphenol A; Endocrine-disrupting chemicals; FSH-β; Gonadotropin-α; Kryptolebias marmoratus; LH-β; Pituitary","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; follitropin beta subunit; gonadotropin; luteinizing hormone beta subunit; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; brain tissue; controlled study; environmental exposure; fish; gene expression; gene expression profiling; hermaphroditism; hypophysis; Kryptolebias marmoratus; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tissue distribution; transcription regulation; unindexed sequence; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Cyprinodontiformes; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Estradiol; Estrogens, Non-Steroidal; Follicle Stimulating Hormone, beta Subunit; Gene Expression; Gonadotropins, Pituitary; Hermaphroditic Organisms; Luteinizing Hormone, beta Subunit; Molecular Sequence Data; Phenols; Phylogeny; Tamoxifen; Kryptolebias marmoratus"

Kryptolebias marmoratus is a euryhaline fish with unique internal self-fertilization. In order to understand the effect of different salinities and environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on the regulation of prolactin (. PRL) and prolactin receptor (. PRLR) genes, the full-length sequences of PRL and two PRLR genes were cloned from K. marmoratus. The expression pattern of K. marmoratus PRL (. Km-PRL) and PRLR (. Km-PRLR1, Km-PRLR2) mRNAs was analyzed in different developmental stages (2. dpf to 5. h post-hatching) and tissues of hermaphrodite fish. To investigate the effects of salinity changes and EDC exposure, the mRNA expression pattern of PRL, PRLR1 and PRLR2 was analyzed in exposed fish. The Km-PRL mRNA in the hermaphrodite was predominantly expressed in the brain/pituitary, the Km-PRLR1 mRNA was highly expressed in the intestine, while the Km-PRLR2 mRNA was intensively expressed in the gills. The expression of the Km-PRL mRNA generally increased from stage 1 (2. dpf) to stage 3 (12. dpf) in a developmental, stage-dependent manner. It decreased in stage 4 (12. dpf) and the hatching stage (stage 5). Km-PRLR1 and Km-PRLR2 mRNAs showed a gradual increase in expression from stage 1 (2. dpf) to stage 4 (12. dpf) and decreased by stage 5 (5. h post-hatching). Also, both mRNAs of PRLR showed a different expression pattern after exposure to different salinity concentrations (0, 33, and 50. ppt) in juvenile fish. The expression of PRL mRNA was upregulated at 0. ppt, but was downregulated at a moderately higher salinity concentration (33 to 50. ppt). The Km-PRLR1 mRNA showed upregulation at freshwater stress (0. ppt) compared to other concentrations of salinity (33. ppt to 50. ppt). The Km-PRLR2 mRNA was marginally upregulated at freshwater stress (0. ppt), but was downregulated at a higher salinity concentration (50. ppt) and showed no significant change in expression at 33. ppt salinity. Interestingly, both mRNAs showed upregulation in the brain (e.g. Km-PRL) and intestine (e.g. Km-PRLR1) after EDC exposure. These findings suggested that Km-PRL and two Km-PRLR mRNAs would be useful in analyzing the effect of different salinities as well as the modulatory effect of EDC exposure on these gene expressions in K. marmoratus. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Endocrine-disrupting chemicals; Kryptolebias marmoratus; Osmoregulation; Prolactin; Prolactin receptor; Salinity","endocrine disruptor; fresh water; messenger RNA; prolactin; prolactin receptor; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; brain; controlled study; developmental stage; environmental exposure; environmental stress; fish; gene expression; gene expression regulation; gene sequence; gill; hatching; hermaphroditism; hypophysis; intestine; Kryptolebias marmoratus; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; salinity; tissue distribution; water contamination; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Cloning, Molecular; Cyprinodontiformes; Endocrine Disruptors; Gene Expression; Hermaphroditic Organisms; Molecular Sequence Data; Prolactin; Receptors, Prolactin; RNA, Messenger; Salinity; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water-Electrolyte Balance; Kryptolebias marmoratus"

Corralling rapidly doubled fH from ∼31 beats min -1 to a maximum of ∼60 beats min-1, regardless of the duration of the corralling. However, recovery of fH to precorralling levels was significantly faster after the 10-min corralling (7.6 h) than after the 30-min corralling (11.5 h). An exhaustive-exercise treatment (chasing for 3 min, with physical contact) to simulate a predator chasing a fish to exhaustion exhaustion or a fish becoming exhausted after encountering fisheries gear resulted in increased fH (to 60 beats min-1), plasma lactate, glucose, sodium, osmolality, and cortisol (males only) and a significant decrease in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. Recovery of fH and most blood variables was complete about 16 h after exhaustive exercise and handling. The results illustrate a clear relationship between the intensity of exercise and the duration required for recovery of fH. Changes in f H were significantly correlated with those in plasma lactate, chloride, and sodium at 1 h after the exercise treatment protocols.

GR), glutathione peroxidase 1a (. GPx1a), glutathione peroxidase 1b (. GPx1b), Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (. Cu/Zn-SOD), and Mn superoxide dismutase (.

For the time-course experiment, all the antioxidant genes were significantly induced over time except for Cu/Zn-SOD in the liver, and there was a 5-fold induction in hepatic GR, CAT, and Mn-SOD mRNA compared to the control. These findings indicate that the liver of T. obscurus has a robust antioxidant system.

Thus, Treg depletion has already been tested as a promising therapeutic approach in various animal models and entered clinical trials. However, the use of nonspecific Treg targeting agents such as CD25 depleting antibodies, which in addition to CD25+ Tregs also deplete recently activated CD25+ effector T cells, potentially masked the tremendous potential of this therapeutic strategy. To avoid such nonspecific effects, we used transgenic DEREG (depletion of regulatory T cells) mice, which express a diphtheria toxin receptor under control of the Foxp3 locus, allowing selective depletion of Foxp3+ Tregs even during ongoing immune responses. We showed that Foxp3+ Treg depletion induced partial regression of established ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing B16 melanoma, which was associated with an increased intratumoral accumulation of activated CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. The antitumor effect could be significantly enhanced when Treg depletion was combined with vaccination against OVA. To further assess whether this therapeutic approach would break self-tolerance, we crossed DEREGmice with RipOVAlow mice, expressing OVA as neo - self-antigen under control of the rat insulin promoter. In these mice, combined Treg depletion and vaccination also induced tumor regression without the onset of diabetes. Together, our data suggest that selective Treg targeting strategies combined with vaccinations against tumor-associated (self) antigens have the potential to evoke efficient antitumor responses without inducing overt autoimmunity.

Radioactive contamination from Chernobyl constitutes one such extreme perturbation, with significant but highly variable impact on local population density and mutation rates of different species of animals and plants. We explicitly tested the hypothesis that species with strong impacts of radiation on abundance were those with high rates of historical mutation accumulation as reflected by cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA base-pair substitution rates during past environmental perturbations. Using a dataset of 32 species of birds, we show higher historical mitochondrial substitution rates in species with the strongest negative impact of local levels of radiation on local population density. These effects were robust to different estimates of impact of radiation on abundance, weighting of estimates of abundance by sample size, statistical control for similarity in the response among species because of common phylogenetic descent, and effects of population size and longevity.

Through the activation of P2X and P2Y receptors, extracellular ATP enhances tissue repair, promotes the recruitment of immune phagocytes and dendritic cells, and acts as a co-activator of NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes. The conversion of extracellular ATP to adenosine, in contrast, essentially through the enzymatic activity of the ecto-nucleotidases CD39 and CD73, acts as a negative-feedback mechanism to prevent excessive immune responses. Here we review the effects of extracellular ATP and adenosine on tumorigenesis. First, we summarize the functions of extracellular ATP and adenosine in the context of tumor immunity.

Third, we present experimental evidence that extracellular ATP and adenosine receptors are expressed by tumor cells and enhance tumor growth. Finally, we discuss recent studies, including our own work, which suggest that therapeutic approaches that promote ATP-mediated activation of inflammasomes, or inhibit the accumulation of tumor-derived extracellular adenosine, may constitute effective new means to induce anticancer activity. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 0950-9232/10.","Adenosine; ATP; Ecto-nucleotidases; Immunosuppression; Inflammasome","5' nucleotidase; adenosine; adenosine A2 receptor; adenosine receptor; adenosine triphosphate; anthracycline; cadmium; cisplatin; cryopyrin; doxorubicin; etoposide; inflammasome; mitomycin C; mitoxantrone; oxaliplatin; staurosporine; thapsigargin; adenosine; adenosine receptor; adenosine triphosphate; antineoplastic activity; B lymphocyte; cancer therapy; carcinogenesis; dendritic cell; human; immune response; immunosuppressive treatment; natural killer cell; natural killer T cell; neoplasm; nonhuman; phagocyte; priority journal; protein targeting; review; T lymphocyte; Th17 cell; tumor cell; tumor growth; tumor immunity; extracellular space; immunity; metabolism; neoplasm; physiology; signal transduction; Adenosine; Adenosine Triphosphate; Extracellular Space; Humans; Immunity; Immunosuppression; Neoplasms; Receptors, Purinergic P1; Signal Transduction; Adenosine; Adenosine Triphosphate; Extracellular Space; Humans; Immunity; Immunosuppression; Neoplasms; Receptors, Purinergic P1; Signal Transduction"

Various agents have been used to block the CXCL12-CXCR4 interaction as a means of inhibiting cancer metastasis. However, as a potent chemotactic factor for leukocytes, CXCL12 also has the potential to enhance anti-cancer immunity. To further elucidate its role in breast cancer progression, CXCL12 and its antagonist CXCL12(P2G)were overexpressed in the syngeneic 4T1.2 mouse model of breast carcinoma.Results: While expression of CXCL12(P2G)significantly inhibited metastasis, expression of wild-type CXCL12 potently inhibited both metastasis and primary tumor growth. The effects of wild-type CXCL12 were attributed to an immune response characterized by the induction of CD8+T cell activity, enhanced cell-mediated cytotoxicity, increased numbers of CD11c+cells in the tumor-draining lymph nodes and reduced accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the spleen.Conclusions: This study highlights the need to consider carefully therapeutic strategies that block CXCL12 signaling.

Coevolutionary interactions between hosts and parasites may lead to selection on both to evolve extreme phenotypes deviating from the norm, through disruptive selection. Methodology/Principal finding: Here, we show through detailed field studies and experimental procedures that the ashy-throated parrotbill (Paradoxornis alphonsianus) and its avian brood parasite, the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), have both evolved egg polymorphism manifested in discrete immaculate white, pale blue, and blue egg phenotypes within a single population. In this host-parasite system the most common egg colours were white and blue, with no significant difference in parasitism rates between hosts laying eggs of either colour. Furthermore, selection on parasites for countering the evolution of host egg types appears to be strong, since ashy-throated parrotbills have evolved rejection abilities for even partially mimetic eggs. Conclusions/Significance: The parrotbill-cuckoo system constitutes a clear outcome of disruptive selection on both host and parasite egg phenotypes driven by coevolution, due to the cost of parasitism in the host and by host defences in the parasite. The present study is to our knowledge the first to report the influence of disruptive selection on evolution of discrete phenotypes in both parasite and host traits in an avian brood parasitism system. © 2010 Yang et al.",,"article; color; Cuculus canorus; egg; fowl; genetic polymorphism; host parasite interaction; nest predation; nonhuman; Paradoxornis alphonsianus; parasite; parasitism; phenotype; Animals; Biological Evolution; Birds; Clutch Size; Contrast Sensitivity; Host-Parasite Interactions; Nesting Behavior; Ovum; Parasites; Pigmentation; Predatory Behavior; Time Factors; Aves; Cuculus canorus; Paradoxornis alphonsianus"

Evolutionary adaptation to heterogeneously distributed resources may arise from local adaptation with individuals of such locally adapted populations rarely dispersing long distances and hence having small populations and small overall ranges. We quantified mean population density and spatial heterogeneity in population density of 197 bird species across 12 similarly sized regions in the Western Palearctic. Variance in population density among regions differed significantly from a Poisson distribution, suggesting that random processes cannot explain the observed patterns. National estimates of means and variances in population density were positively correlated with continental estimates, suggesting that means and variances were maintained across spatial scales. We used Morisita's index of population abundance as an estimate of heterogeneity in distribution among regions to test a number of predictions. Heterogeneously distributed passerine bird species as reflected, by Morisita's index had small populations, low population densities, and small breeding ranges. Their breeding populations had been consistently maintained at low levels for considerable periods of time, because the degree of genetic variation in a subsample of non-passerines and passerines was significantly negatively related to heterogeneity in distribution. Heterogeneously distributed passerine species were not more often habitat specialists than homogeneously distributed species. Furthermore, heterogeneously distributed passerine species had high annual adult survival rates but did not differ in annual fecundity from homogeneously distributed species. Heterogeneously distributed passerine species rarely colonized urban habitats. Finally, homogeneously distributed bird species were hosts to a greater diversity of blood parasite species than heterogeneously distributed species. In conclusion, small breeding ranges, population sizes, and population densities of heterogeneously distributed passerine bird species, combined with their low degree of genetic variability, and their inability to colonize urban areas may render such species particularly susceptible to human-influenced global climatic changes. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Band-sharing coefficient; Blood parasites; Dispersal; Fragmentation; Morisita's index; Spatial scale; Specialization","abundance; breeding population; climate change; evolutionary biology; fecundity; genetic variation; geographical distribution; hemoparasite; heterogeneity; local adaptation; passerine; population density; population size; spatial analysis; specialization; survival; Africa; animal; animal parasitosis; article; Asia; bird disease; classification; demography; ecosystem; Europe; parasitology; physiology; songbird; Africa; Animals; Asia; Bird Diseases; Demography; Ecosystem; Europe; Parasitic Diseases, Animal; Passeriformes; Europe; Middle East; North Africa; Aves; Passeriformes"

In fishes, relatively few studies have focused on hormonal control of parental care, despite a comprehensive background on the general physiology of fishes, and the frequent occurrence of parental care behaviors. Studies on this taxon have repeatedly found that the relationships between androgens and paternal care do not follow the predictions made in the avian and mammalian literature. Glucocorticoids may also have a role in mediating parental behaviors, possibly through their role as regulators of metabolism. As such, we investigated the role of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and cortisol in mediating parental effort of male smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) by manipulating hormone titers in wild fish. In smallmouth bass, males spawn annually with a single female and defend a single brood for up to 30. days. Treatment of parental fish with cyproterone acetate (CYA; an androgen receptor antagonist) resulted in a decrease in nest defense in response to a simulated brood predator; however, no changes in nest success, nest tending or biochemical indicators of nutritional status were detected. Treatment with exogenous cortisol did not change parental behavior, but did increase the rate of nest failure, possibly owing to the energetic cost of chronically elevated cortisol concentrations. We discuss these findings in the context of resource-driven trade-offs and highlight life history as an important factor controlling parental effort in species with costly parental care behaviors. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","11-Ketotestosterone; Challenge hypothesis; Corticosterone; Cyproterone acetate; Fish; Micropterus dolomieu; Parental care; Smallmouth bass; Teleost","11 oxotestosterone; androgen; cyproterone acetate; hydrocortisone; animal experiment; article; chemical analysis; concentration (parameters); controlled study; life history; male; nesting; nonhuman; nutritional status; parental behavior; Perciformes; predator; priority journal; spawning; teleost; wild type; Androgen Antagonists; Androgens; Animals; Animals, Wild; Bass; Behavior, Animal; Biological Markers; Cyproterone Acetate; Female; Hydrocortisone; Male; Maternal Behavior; Nesting Behavior; Nutrition Assessment; Paternal Behavior"

Analysis of AbQM sequence revealed the presence of characteristic motifs, including the ribosomal protein L10 signature, SH3-binding motif and two antibiotic binding sites. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that AbQM is closely related to other mollusk QM proteins, and altogether they form a mollusk QM protein sub-family which displays evolutionary conservation from yeast to human.Tissue-specific expression and transcriptional regulation of AbQM was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR in response to bacterial (Vibrio alginolyticus and Vibrio parahemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes) and viral (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, VHSV) challenge. AbQM transcripts were found to be expressed ubiquitously in all examined tissues in a constitutive manner, as similar expression levels were detected in hemocytes, mantle, digestive tract and muscle. Upon bacterial and VHSV challenge, AbQM showed significant up-regulation in gills, but not in hemocytes.

The amplification of interleukin-17 (IL-17) production by G-CSF occurs in both CD4 and CD8 conventional T cells and is dependent on, and downstream of, G-CSF-induced IL-21 signaling. Importantly, donor IL-17A controls the infiltration of macrophages into skin and cutaneous fibrosis, manifesting late after transplantation as scleroderma. Interestingly, donor CD8 T cells were the predominant source of IL-17A after transplantation and could mediate scleroderma independently of CD4 T cells.

We demonstrate that methylcholanthrene-induced RKIK sarcoma cells were susceptible to NK cell-mediated lysis in vitro and in vivo following adoptive transfer of NK cells in C57BL/6 RAG-2-/-γc-/- mice. Cytotoxic molecules perforin, granzymes B and M as well as the death ligand TRAIL and pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ were found to be important in the anti-tumor effect mediated by adoptively transferred NK cells.

Whereas caspase-1-deficient mice were completely resistant to LPS, reduced serum cytokine production and resistance to lethal endotoxicosis were also obtained with perforin-deficient mice, indicating a role for granzymes. Consistently, a lack of granzyme M (GrzM) resulted in reduced serum IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF, and IFN-γ levels and significantly reduced susceptibility to lethal endotoxicosis. These altered responses were also observed in granzyme A-deficient but not granzyme B-deficient mice. A role for APC-NK cell cross-talk in the inflammatory cascade was highlighted, as GrzM was exclusively expressed by NK cells and resistance to LPS was also observed on a RAG-1/GrzM-double deficient background. Collectively, the data suggest that NK cell GrzM augments the inflammatory cascade downstream of LPS-TLR4 signaling, which ultimately results in lethal endotoxicosis. Most importantly, these data demonstrate that granzymes should no longer be considered solely as mediators of apoptosis, but additionally as potential key regulators of inflammation.

The ability to escape in three dimensions by flying animals has been hypothesized to result in greater survival and eventually slower senescence than in animals only fleeing in two dimensions. In a comparative study of flight initiation distance in 69 species of birds when approached by a human, I found that the amount of variance explained by flight initiation distance was more than four times as large for the horizontal than the vertical component of perch height when taking flight. The slope of the relationship between horizontal distance and flight initiation distance (horizontal slope) increased with increasing body mass across species, whereas the slope of the relationship between vertical distance and flight initiation distance (vertical slope) decreased with increasing body mass. Therefore, there was a negative relationship between horizontal and vertical slope, although this negative relationship was significantly less steep than expected for a perfect trade-off. The horizontal slope decreased with increasing density of the habitat from grassland over shrub to forest, whereas that was not the case for the vertical slope. Adult survival rate increased and rate of senescence (longevity adjusted for survival rate, body mass and sampling effort) decreased with increasing vertical, but not with horizontal slope, consistent with the prediction that vertical escape indeed provides a means of reducing the impact of predation. © 2010 The Author.

The Ab-CaReg I is composed of 176 amino acids and the calculated molecular mass and isoelectric point were 20 and 4.2, respectively. The sequence homology of Ab-CaReg I was 28-30 and 18-27% of known calmodulin and troponin C, respectively. Four characteristic calcium-binding EF hand motifs with some modifications at conserved positions of known homologous calmodulin genes were observed in the sequence. The tissue-specific transcription analysis and variation of mRNA transcription level of Ab-CaReg I in gills and mantle after animals were immersed in seawater containing 2000 ppm CaCl2 was quantified by SYBR Green real-time PCR analysis. Transcription variation of Ab-CaReg I in hemocytes and gills followed by bacteria challenge (Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes) was used to investigate Ab-CaReg I in immune responses. Transcripts of Ab-CaReg I mRNA were mainly detected in hemocytes, mantle, muscle, gills, digestive tract and hepatopancreas with highest expression in hemocytes. The CaCl2 immersion significantly altered the Ab-CaReg I mRNA transcription level by 3 h, compared to animals in normal seawater (control). The mRNA expression of Ab-CaReg I in gills and hemocytes was upregulated significantly to 11-fold and 4-fold in 3 h compared to control (uninfected), respectively, in bacteria-challenged abalones. The results suggest that Ab-CaReg I could be effectively induced to maintain internal Ca2+ homeostasis of the animal due to influx of Ca2+ in the cells by external stimuli such as a high dose of Ca2+ and pathogens like bacteria. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Bacteria challenge; Calcium; Calcium immersion; Disk abalone; Haliotis discus discus","calcium; calcium; amino acid sequence; animal; article; bacterial phenomena and functions; gastropod; gene expression regulation; genetics; homeostasis; immunology; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; protein motif; sequence alignment; gastropod; genetics; metabolism; protein motif; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Base Sequence; Calcium; EF Hand Motifs; Gastropoda; Gene Expression Regulation; Homeostasis; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Sequence Alignment; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Haliotidae; Haliotis discus discus; Listeria monocytogenes; Vibrio alginolyticus; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Base Sequence; Calcium; EF Hand Motifs; Gastropoda; Gene Expression Regulation; Homeostasis; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Sequence Alignment"

As such, there is a need for information on the spatial ecology of juvenile lemon sharks to identify critical habitats that require protection, as well as to understand their basic ecology. The purpose of this study was to determine the habitat preferences and movement patterns of juvenile lemon sharks along a sub-section of coastline characterized by coastal flats and tidal creeks of Eleuthera, The Bahamas. Eleven juvenile lemon sharks (766 ± 127 mm total length; mean±SD) were captured from various tidal creeks within the 23 km study area and were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters. A series of 27 hydrophone receivers acted as a passive monitoring array to detect tagged individuals as they moved among habitats. Findings suggest that juvenile lemon sharks tagged in this study prefer shallow water habitats within tidal creeks, and typically display high site fidelity with occasional forays to alternate habitats or creeks. In fact, more than 90% of tagged lemon sharks had the greatest percentage of detections located at a receiver at or close to the location where they were tagged. There was no evidence of differences in diel or seasonal movement and habitat use. Knowledge gained from this study will be useful for directing future conservation and management strategies including coastal development plans and marine protected areas. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Acoustic telemetry; Lemon shark; Nursery area; Site fidelity","capture method; coast; coastal water; endangered species; exploitation; habitat selection; habitat type; habitat use; hydrophone; juvenile; nearshore environment; population structure; shark; site fidelity; spatial variation; telemetry; Bahamas; Eleuthera; Chondrichthyes; Citrus limon; Negaprion; Negaprion brevirostris"

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to this efficacy remain poorly understood. In this study, using the first described C57BL/6 (B6) TRAIL-sensitive experimental tumor models, we have characterized the innate and adaptive immune components involved in the primary rejection phase of an anti-mouse DR5 (mDR5) mAb, MD5-1 in established MC38 colon adenocarcinomas. FcR mediated cross-linking of MD5-1 significantly inhibited the growth of MC38 colon adenocarcinomas through the induction of TRAIL-R-dependent tumor cell apoptosis. The loss of host DR5, TRAIL, perforin, FasL, or TNF did not compromise anti-DR5 therapy in vivo. By contrast, anti-DR5 therapy was completely abrogated in mice deficient of B cells or CD11c + dendritic cells (DCs), providing the first direct evidence that these cells play a critical role. Importantly, the requirement for an intact B cell compartment for optimal anti-DR5 antitumor efficacy was also observed in established AT-3 mammary tumors. Interestingly, MD5-1-mediated apoptosis as measured by early TUNEL activity was completely lost in B cell-deficient μMT mice, but intact in mice deficient in CD11c+ DCs.

To date, there have been no studies that have investigated the cardiovascular correlates of extended parental care in fish. Using Doppler flow probes, the cardiovascular performance of six syntopic centrarchid fish species (N=232) that provide sole, male parental care was examined across a range of water temperatures that encompass their reproductive periods (14-26°C). Experiments were restricted to males but included both nesting and non-nesting individuals to evaluate the cardiovascular performance of fish during parental care. Resting values for cardiac output (Q) and heart rate (fH) tended to be higher for nesting fish when adjusted for variation in temperature. Both of these cardiac variables also increased with water temperature. Stroke volume (Vs) was similar among nesting and non-nesting fish and was generally thermally insensitive. When exposed to exhaustive exercise, nesting fish took longer to exhaust than non-nesting individuals. The high resting levels found in nesting fish accompanied by only minor increases in maximal values typically resulted in reductions in cardiac scope. Cardiovascular variables recovered more quickly in nesting fish, which could facilitate the high activity and bursting associated with parental care. Interspecifically, several cardiovascular variables were correlated with parental care activity. Parental care investment became more energetically expensive as the degree of cardiac frequency modulation decreased. Additionally, as the duration of parental care increased, so did the time required for fish to become exhausted, although this relationship was probably influenced by the fact that the larger species (e.g. smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomleu; largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides) provided the lengthiest care. Collectively, these data indicate that fish that provide parental care possess adaptations, including sufficient phenotypic plasticity, such that they can enhance their ability to provide high intensity protracted care, and emphasize the nexus between behavior and physiology. © 2010.

The duration of the reproductive season may depend on the duration of the growing season, with recent amelioration in spring temperatures allowing earlier start of reproduction. Earlier start of reproduction may allow a longer breeding season because of more broods a longer interval between broods for multi-brooded species. 2. We analysed extensive long-term data sets on timing of breeding in 20 species of birds from Denmark, based on records of over 100 000 individual offspring, showing considerable heterogeneity among species in temporal change in duration of the breeding season. 3. Multi-brooded species increased the duration of their breeding season by 0·43 days year-1 while single-brooded species decreased the duration of their breeding season by 0·44 days year-1. This implies that recent climate change has allowed more broods or better temporal spacing of broods in multi-brooded species, while the time window for reproduction has become narrower in single-brooded species. 4. The single-most important predictor of change in duration of the breeding season was change in the date breeding started; there was no change in the date of end of breeding. Species advancing their breeding date the most also expanded the duration of the breeding season. In contrast, longdistance migration and generation time did not predict change in duration of the breeding season. © 2010 The Authors.

Development in the sector and its interaction with non-fishery-related nature conservation objectives for aquatic biodiversity, however, have the potential to generate conflict. This article reviews the intersection between recreational fisheries and nature conservation goals for aquatic biodiversity with specific reference to inland waters in industrialized countries, and the principal management activities and constraints that can lead to conflicts. A SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis was used to review the issues facing sectoral development and identify options for future advancement of recreational fisheries to ameliorate potential conflicts with nature conservation goals. It is concluded that reconciliation of recreational fisheries and modern conservation perspectives is both possible and desirable, because many conservation problems also benefit fisheries quality. Angler buy-in to conservation is probable if (1) management scales are small, (2) threats to conservation originate from outside the fisheries sectors and (3) ecological awareness for the conservation problem is high. If these aspects are not present, reconciliation of recreational fisheries and nature conservation goals is less likely, risking both the aquatic biodiversity and the future of angling. To address these issues, enforcement of legislation and continued communication with angler communities is necessary, as well as development of integrated management policies that build on the instrumental values of aquatic biodiversity for recreational fisheries, while curtailing the more insidious threats to such biodiversity that originate directly from the recreational fisheries sector. © 2010 The Authors.

Here, the content of the global 100 question exercise relevant to aquatic and fisheries issues is summarized and a critical analysis is provided. Many of the questions addressed in apparently unrelated themes and topics (e.g. terrestrial, agriculture and energy policy) have potential relevance to fisheries and aquatic habitats, which underlines the connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic realms. Given the intimate link between aquatic environmental problems and human activities (including culture and economics), greater understanding of the human dimension is required to inform decision making. Stakeholder perspectives need to be included as a core component of the fisheries management triangle (i.e. managing fish, habitat and people). The benefits and risks of conducting a global 100 questions exercise with an exclusive focus on questions of relevance to fisheries and aquatic practitioners are also considered. There is no question that evidence-based approaches to conservation are essential for addressing the many threats that face aquatic ecosystems and reverse the imperilment trends among ichthyofauna. It is still unclear, however, as to the extent to which 100 questions exercises will help to achieve conservation and management targets for aquatic resources. A global 100 questions exercise that focused on fisheries and aquatic issues would certainly help to generate interest and awareness sufficient to justify such an exercise. © 2010 The Authors.

Bird species with larger uropygial glands had more genera of chewing lice of the sub-order Amblycera, but not of the sub-order Ischnocera, and more feather mites. There was a fitness advantage associated with relatively large uropygial glands because such species had higher hatching success.

The mitogenome of O. nanseni is circular and contains all the typical mt genes (2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 protein-coding genes). It has two peculiar non-coding regions of 148 bp and 194 bp. The latter can be involved in replication and termination processes. The total length of the pooled protein-coding, rRNA, and tRNA genes is shorter than those of other crustaceans. In addition, the intergenic spacers of the O. nanseni mitogenome are considerably shorter in length than those of other crustaceans. Fourteen adjacent genes overlap, resulting in a compact mitogenomic structure. In the O. nanseni mitogenome, the AT composition is elevated, particularly in the control regions (78.9% AT), as has been demonstrated for two other amphipods. The tRNA order is highly rearranged compared to other arthropod mitogenomes, but the order of protein-coding genes and rRNAs is largely conserved. The gene cluster between the CO1 and CO3 genes is completely conserved among all amphipods compared.

Indeed, conservation physiology has much to offer policy makers because of the rigorous experimental approach and the focus on elucidating cause-and-effect relationships. However, there remain a number of challenges that might retard the adoption of this approach. Here, we identify these challenges and suggest a path for both physiologists and conservation practitioners to integrate their respective fields. One issue is that threat assessments and conservation actions tend to focus on populations or species, whereas physiology tends to focus on individuals, cells, or molecules. Physiologists must determine if and how the physiology of individual organisms can influence population-level processes. It is also necessary to validate more tools in the ""conservation physiology toolbox,"" and ensure a thorough understanding of the physiological biomarkers applied to conservation efforts. Research on imperiled taxa will be more useful to those making management decisions, rather than research focused on model species.

Urban areas are characterized by warmer microclimates, higher levels of primary productivity, longer breeding seasons and higher levels of pollutants. All these factors should cause oxidative stress, favoring invasion by species that have access to high levels of antioxidants. We analyzed concentrations of two categories of dietary, fat-soluble antioxidants (total carotenoids, total vitamin E) in the liver, the main storage organ in birds. Individuals killed by cats had lower levels of vitamin E than individuals that died for other reasons, showing natural selection on stored antioxidants. Bird species that had successfully colonized urban areas had significantly higher levels of vitamin E and total carotenoids than species that did not succeed, and rural populations had higher concentrations of vitamin E and total carotenoids than urban populations of the same species. Interspecific differences in concentrations of fat-soluble antioxidants, and differences between rural and urban populations of the same species, were accounted for by diet, but also by time since urbanization and number of generations since urbanization. These findings suggest that antioxidants, and by implication the ability to cope with oxidative stress, have contributed to successful invasion of urban areas by birds, and that the concentration of these antioxidants has changed in response to the urban environment. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Carotenoids; Condition; Diet; Invasion; Predation","antioxidant; carotenoid; antioxidant; bird; breeding season; carotenoid; diet; habitat type; invasibility; microclimate; natural selection; predation; primary production; rural population; urban area; urban ecosystem; urban population; urbanization; animal; article; bird; body weight; diet; geography; high performance liquid chromatography; liver; metabolism; organ size; Animals; Antioxidants; Birds; Body Weight; Carotenoids; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Diet; Geography; Liver; Organ Size; Animalia; Aves"

One mechanism, known as granule exocytosis, employs the secretory granules of these lymphocytes. These include the pore-forming protein perforin (pfp) and a family of serine proteases known as granzymes that cleave and activate effector molecules within the target cell. Over the past two decades, the study of granzymes has largely focused on the ability of these serine proteases to induce cell death. More recently, sophisticated mouse models of disease coupled with gene-targeted mice have allowed investigators to ask why granzyme subfamilies are encoded on different chromosomal loci and what broader role these enzymes might play in inflammation and immune response. Here, we provide a brief overview of the granzyme superfamily, their relationship to pfp, and their reported functions in apoptosis.

We explored the consequences of the return to FW by collecting maturing sockeye salmon from the marine waters off the mouth of the Fraser River and holding ∼50 sockeye in each of five treatments: saltwater (SW; salinity p 28 ppt), iso-osmotic water (ISO; 13 ppt), FW (0 ppt), SW + gonadotropin-releasing hormone (SW + GnRH), and FW + GnRH. Exogenous GnRH treatments were intended to accelerate maturation. Results demonstrate that gill Na+,K+ ATPase activity, sex steroid concentrations, and cortisol levels were highly responsive to experimental manipulations and followed predicted trajectories (i.e., FW + GnRH sockeye were the most mature and FW adapted). There were few among-treatment differences in hematocrit and plasma concentrations of lactate, glucose, Na +, Cl-, and plasma osmolality among sockeye that survived to the end of treatments, indicating that sockeye rigorously maintain internal homeostatic conditions while alive. There were large among-treatment differences in mortality (SW + GnRH &gt; SW &gt; FW + GnRH &gt; FW = ISO), and each treatment experienced a notable increase in mortality rate around the fifth day of treatment. Our results indicate that salinity represented a modestly larger challenge to the experimental sockeye than did the artificially accelerated sexual maturation. Our results also suggest that maturing sockeye either successfully acclimate to FW within 5 d of exposure or perish. These findings are consistent with the predictions of the theory of anadromy, in suggesting that the return of adults to FW can be physiologically challenging and can represent a period of significant natural mortality. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

Here, we report the discovery of disk abalone LITAF (AbLITAF) and Rel/NF-kB (AbRel/NF-kB) homologues and their immune responses. Full-length cDNA of AbLITAF consists of 441 bp open reading frame (ORF) that translates into putative peptide of 147 aa. Analysis of AbLITAF sequence showed it has characteristic LITAF (Zn+2) binding domain with two CXXC motifs. Phylogenetic analysis results further revealed that AbLITAF is a member of LITAF family. AbRel/NF-kB is 584 aa protein that contains several characteristic motifs including Rel homology domain (RHD), Rel protein signature, DNA binding motif, nuclear localization signal (NLS) and transcription factor immunoglobulin - like fold (TIG) similar to their invertebrate and vertebrate counterparts. Tissue specific analysis results showed that both AbLITAF and AbRel/NF-kB mRNA was expressed ubiquitously in all selected tissues in constitutive manner. However, constitutive expression of AbLITAF was higher than AbRel/NF-kB in all tissues except mantle. Upon immune challenge by bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahemolyticus and Lysteria monocytogenes) and viral hemoragic septicemia virus (VHSV), AbLITAF showed the significant up-regulation in gills while AbRel/NF-kB transcription was not change significantly. Based on transcriptional response against immune challenge, we could suggest that regulation of TNF-α expression may have occurred mainly by LITAF activation rather than NF-kB in disk abalone. The cumulative data from other molluscs and our data with reference to TNF-α, LITAF and Rel/NF-kB from disk abalone provide strong evidence that LITAF and NF-kB are independent pathways likely to occur throughout the Phylum mollusca. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

UVR impairs sperm motility, reduces fertilization, and causes embryo malformation that in turn affects recruitment and therefore the sustainability of natural populations. The direct molecular effects of UVR are mediated by absorption of certain wavelengths by specific macromolecules and the dissipation of the absorbed energy via photochemical reactions. Most organisms have defense mechanisms that either prevent UVR-induced damage, or mechanisms that repair the damage. Photoprotective pigments, antioxidant defense compounds, and cell cycle development genes are some of the molecules involved in UVR defense. Photoenzymatic repair and nucleotide excision repair are the two primary DNA repair systems in marine ectotherms. We anticipate that toxicogenomic studies will gain importance in UVR research because they can elucidate the primary processes involved in UVR damage and the cellular response to this damage. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we identified the full-length Vg1 and Vg2 sequence from the brackish water copepod, Paracyclopina nana. Vg1 gene contained 5718 bp of the open reading frame (ORF) that encoded the putative protein of 1905 amino acids residues, while Vg2 gene consisted of 5442 bp of ORF, encoding the putative protein of 1813 amino acids residues. P. nana Vgs showed highly conserved domains in the N-terminal region. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that P. nana Vgs are distinct from other arthropods, such as insects and decapods, as it formed a clade with other copepods, Tigriopus japonicus and salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). The expression of Vg transcripts was detectable after the copepodid stages 4-5. Female copepods expressed over 83 times and 223 times more Vg1 and Vg2 transcripts, respectively, than males. When copepods were exposed to heavy metals (0.1 mg/L Cd, 0.4 mg/L Cu, and 2 mg/L AsIII) for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, P. nana Vg transcripts were highly induced in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, Vg2 gene was more susceptible than Vg1 to trace heavy metal exposure. This finding indicates that P. nana Vgs provide a potential indicator for assessing the toxic effect of heavy metals. In addition, we suggest P. nana as a potential model species for risk-assessment to environmental pollutants in brackish water. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The Ab-Antistasin (1398-bp) consisted of an 1185-bp open reading frame encoding 395 amino acid (aa) residues. The predicted molecular mass and isoelectric point of Ab-Antistasin was 44 kDa and 8.5, respectively, and showed highest identity (23.1%) to Hydra magnipapillata antistasin. The most striking feature of Ab-Antistasin is the 12-fold internal repeats (IR) of an antistasin-like domain. Ten of the 12 IR domains (26-27 aa) are highly conserved, with 6 cysteines and 1 glycine. Ab-Antistasin was comprised of three Bowman-Birk serine protease inhibitor family motifs. The recombinant Ab-Antistasin (rAb-Antistasin) was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using a pMAL system. rAb-Antistasin (10 μM) was able to inhibit trypsin activity by 66% in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, it exhibited low prolongation activity for coagulation in an APTT assay (86.0 s compared to control 42.0 s) with human blood. Endogenous Ab-Antistasin mRNA was found to be expressed in digestive tract, hepatopancreas, hemocytes, abductor muscle and mantle, with highest expression levels in digestive tract followed by hepatopancreas and hemocytes. Quantitative real time PCR results revealed that Ab-Antistasin transcription was significantly induced at 3 h post-infection (p.i.) after challenged by a mixture of bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Listeria monocytogenes) in the abalone digestive tract; in the hemocytes, induction occurred at 6 and 12 h.

To design primers for the RT-PCR, we cloned the B. orientalis aromatase gene using RT-PCR and degenerate primers. The full-length cDNA was obtained by 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR. The complete sequence of the B. orientalis aromatase gene revealed an open reading frame of 1500 bp encoding a deduced protein of 500 amino acids. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR indicated that nonylphenol or bisphenol-A injection did not significantly affect the expression of B. orientalis aromatase mRNA. However, a 48-hr treatment with nonyphenol or bisphenol A reduced aromatase activity to 47% and 32% of the control, respectively.

To investigate the role of EcR during development and the effect to environmental stressors on EcR expression in a copepod, we isolated and characterized cDNA and 5′-promoter region of the Tigriopus japonicus EcR (TJ-EcR), and studied mRNA expression pattern. The full-length TJ-EcR cDNA sequence was 1962 bp in length and the open reading frame encoded 546 amino acids. The deduced TJ-EcR protein contained well-conserved DNA-binding domain and ligand-binding domain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TJ-EcR was clustered with the EcR of other crustaceans. TJ-EcR mRNA was expressed in a developmental stage-specific manner: high in early developmental stages and low in the adult stage. Significantly elevated expression of the TJ-EcR gene in adults was detected at hypersalinity (42 ppt) and high temperature (35 °C) condition. The 5′-flanking region of TJ-EcR gene contains heat shock protein 70 response elements, implying that the environmental stressors may affect its expression via the stress-sensor.

They were sampled at intervals of 7, 15, and 30 days after a single E2 injection. Gonadosomatic index (GSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI), the frequency of gonadal development, number of ovulated eggs, and plasma steroids levels were measured. The transcript abundances of vitellogenin (VTG) and estrogen receptors (ERα and β) mRNA in the liver were also analyzed using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (real time PCR). GSI and the frequency of mature oocytes in the 100-μg E2-exposed group decreased compared to that of the control group during the experiment, and the number of ovulated eggs in the 100-μg E2-exposed group was lower when compared to the other groups. However, plasma E2 and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) levels were not significantly different between the experimental groups. On the other hand, plasma testosterone level and VTG mRNA abundance in the 100-μg E2-exposed group were significantly lower than the control group after 30 days. These results indicate that E2 stimulation at high concentration interferes with reproductive phenomena through delayed response. In addition, HSI in the 100-μg E2-exposed group and ERα mRNA abundance in the 1-μg E2-exposed group were significantly higher than the control group at 7 days after E2 injection, although there was no significant difference in HSI and ERα mRNA between all groups at 30 days.

Surprisingly, there are hardly any intraspecific studies investigating how individuals differing in brain size behave, how such individuals are distributed and how brain size is related to life history and fitness components. Brain mass of the barn swallow Hirundo rustica was strongly predicted by external head volume, explaining 99.5% of the variance, allowing for repeatable estimates of head volume as a reflection of brain size. Repeatability of head volume within and between years was high, suggesting that measurement errors were small. In a 2 years study of 501 individual adult barn swallows, I showed that head volume differed between sexes and age classes, with yearlings having smaller and more variable heads than older individuals, and females having smaller and more variable heads than males. Large head volume was not a consequence of large body size, which was a poor predictor of head volume. Birds with large heads arrived early from spring migration, independent of sex and age, indicating that migratory performance may have an important cognitive component. Head volume significantly predicted capture date and recapture probability, suggesting that head volume is related to learning ability, although morphological traits such as wing length, aspect ratio and wing area were unimportant predictors. Intensity of defence of offspring increased with head volume in females, but not in males. Barn swallows with large heads aggregated in large colonies, suggesting that individuals with large heads were more common in socially complex environments. These results suggest that brain size is currently under natural and sexual selection, and that micro-evolutionary processes affecting brain size can be studied under field conditions. © 2010 The Author.

Birds eat grit to facilitate break down of food by the gizzard, and this function is independent of the colour of grit, but depends on the physical properties of stones. Bird species were significantly consistent in colour of grit, and grit of different colours varied in prevalence among species, even when analyses were restricted to a sample from a single locality. There were positive correlations between presence of lilac and red grit in the gizzard and presence of sexually dichromatic lilac and red colour on the body. There was a positive correlation between red grit colour and red sexually monochromatic body colour. Bird species with many different sexual colours, but not sexually monochromatic colours on their body had many different colours of grit. Males had more lilac and red grit than females, with this effect differing among species, whereas that was not the case for grit of other colours. These findings are consistent with the sensory bias hypothesis that birds express preferences for grit of specific colours and a high diversity of colours related to sexual colouration of the body, even when the colour of such grit is only visible to the individual at the moment of ingestion. © 2009 The Authors.

Though laboratory studies of teleost fishes have consistently demonstrated individual repeatability of swimming performance, this phenomenon has rarely been studied in the field and never across multiple years. Using a whole-lake acoustic telemetry array with submetre accuracy, we assessed the individual repeatability of two metrics of swimming performance (daily distance traveled and mean daily swimming speed) within four seasons during a year (fall, winter, spring, and summer), among these seasons, and between winters of 2 years. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides (Lacepède, 1802)) formed stable performance hierarchies within seasons except spring and no sexspecific differences in rankings were noted. Individual swimming performance was not repeatable among seasons during 1 year or across multiple winters. Seasonal changes in environmental and intrinsic biological conditions appear to result in a reshuffling of performance hierarchies, perhaps reflecting individual differences in organismal physiology.",,"acoustic method; activity pattern; environmental conditions; freshwater ecosystem; perciform; physiological response; seasonal variation; swimming; telemetry; Micropterus; Micropterus salmoides; Teleostei"

These include loss of fear of humans, reduced corticosterone levels, prolonged breeding seasons, and several others. Here, I test the hypothesis that urbanization results from differential colonization of urban areas by species with heterogeneous levels of fear in the ancestral rural populations, followed by a reduction in variance in fear responses with a subsequent increase in diversity of fear responses as urban populations become adapted to the urban environment. Using information on variance in flight initiation distances (FIDs) when approached by a human, I show that rural populations of birds characterized by short mean flight distances and large variances in flight distances differentially colonized urban areas. As a consequence of this urban invasion, urban populations lost variation in FID. The variance in FID was initially larger in rural than in urban populations but eventually became larger in urban populations with time since urbanization. This secondary increase in variance in FID of urban populations was associated with an increase in population density of urban populations, suggesting that as birds became adapted to urban areas, they secondarily gained variance in behavioral flexibility.","Flight initiation distance; Invasion; Personality; Urbanization","adaptation; behavioral response; bird; breeding season; cognition; colonization; domestication; hormone; hypothesis testing; life history trait; urban area; urbanization; Aves"

IL-21, secreted by T follicular helper cells, is important for adaptive immune responses, although there are conflicting reports on its target cells and mode of action in vivo. We show that the absence of IL-21 signaling profoundly affects the B cell response to protein antigen, reducing splenic and bone marrow plasma cell formation and GC persistence and function, influencing their proliferation, transition into memory B cells, and affinity maturation. Using bone marrow chimeras, we show that these activities are primarily a result of CD3-expressing cells producing IL-21 that acts directly on B cells. Molecularly, IL-21 maintains expression of Bcl-6 in GC B cells. The absence of IL-21 or IL-21 receptor does not abrogate the appearance of T cells in GCs or the appearance of CD4 T cells with a follicular helper phenotype.

Recently, sexual ornaments, particularly carotenoid-based colourful traits, have been proposed to depend on a male's capacity to resist oxidative stress, and thus to signal sperm quality. We conducted an experimental test of this hypothesis on great tits Parus major, in which adults are sexually dichromatic in carotenoid-based breast plumage. We report the first evidence that ornaments and sperm quality may be linked through oxidative stress. When experimentally subjected to oxidative stress resulting from increased workload, less colourful males suffered a greater reduction in sperm motility and swimming ability, and increased levels of sperm lipid peroxidation compared to more colourful males. Moreover, the level of sperm lipid peroxidation was negatively correlated with sperm quality. Finally, carotenoid supplementation increased sperm quality of less colourful males, suggesting that pale males are deficient in carotenoid antioxidants. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Carotenoid-based colour; Carotenoids; Lipid peroxidation; Oxidative stress; Parus major; Sperm motility; Sperm quality; Sperm velocity","antioxidant; carotenoid; carotenoid; fertility; free radical; lipid; motility; passerine; plumage; sperm; swimming; animal; article; clutch size; male; metabolism; oxidative stress; physiology; pigmentation; sexual development; songbird; spermatozoon; Animals; Antioxidants; Carotenoids; Clutch Size; Male; Oxidative Stress; Passeriformes; Pigmentation; Sex Characteristics; Spermatozoa; Parus major"

In this study, cDNA of a new mollusk defensin was identified from a normalized cDNA library constructed from whole tissues of disk abalone. Abalone defensin peptide (pro-defensin) has a 198-bp coding sequence comprised of a putative 66 amino acids with a mature defensin consisting of 48 amino acid residues. The presence of an invertebrate defensin family domain, an arrangement of six cysteine residues and their disulfide linkage in C1-C4, C2-C5 and C3-C6 form, an alpha helix in three-dimensional structure and a phylogenetic relationship suggests that abalone defensin could be a new member of the invertebrate defensin family, and related to arthropod defensins. In non-stimulated abalone, defensin transcripts were constitutively expressed in all examined tissues including hemocytes, gills, mantle, muscle, digestive tract and hepatopancreas. It was observed that abalone defensin transcripts were significantly induced in hemocytes, gills and digestive tract at different time intervals after infection by pathogenic bacteria mixture containing Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahemolyticus and Lysteria monocytogenes.

Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We performed proof-of-concept studies investigating the therapeutic potential and mechanism of action of monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapy against CD73, an ecto-enzyme overexpressed on breast-cancer cells that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of adenosine monophosphates into adenosine. We showed that anti-CD73 mAb therapy significantly delayed primary 4T1.2 and E0771 tumor growth in immune-competent mice and significantly inhibited the development of spontaneous 4T1.2 lung metastases. Notably, anti-CD73 mAb therapy was essentially dependent on the induction of adaptive anti-tumor immune responses. Knockdown of CD73 in 4T1.2 tumor cells confirmed the tumor-promoting effects of CD73. In addition to its immunosuppressive effect, CD73 enhanced tumor-cell chemotaxis, suggesting a role for CD73-derived adenosine in tumor metastasis. Accordingly, administration of adenosine-5′-N-ethylcarboxamide to tumorbearing mice significantly enhanced spontaneous 4T1.2 lung metastasis. Using selective adenosine-receptor antagonists, we showed that activation of A2B adenosine receptors promoted 4T1.2 tumorcell chemotaxis invitroandmetastasis invivo. Inconclusion,our study identified tumor-derived CD73 as a mechanism of tumor immune escape and tumor metastasis, and it also established the proof of concept that targeted therapy against CD73 can trigger adaptive anti-tumor immunity and inhibit metastasis of breast cancer.","Adenosine; Cancer; Chemotaxis; Immunosuppression; Regulatory","5' nucleotidase; monoclonal antibody; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; breast cancer; cancer inhibition; chemotaxis; controlled study; dephosphorylation; drug mechanism; female; immunocompetence; immunotherapy; lung metastasis; metastasis inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; tumor immunity; 5'-Nucleotidase; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Neoplasm; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Disease Progression; Female; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, SCID; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Transplantation; Mus"

DNAM-1 is an NK cell receptor whose importance in facilitating activation signals received by NK cells in natural and cytokine-driven responses to tumor metastases in vivo is poorly explored. In this study, we used matched tumor lines expressing a variety of relevant ligands, neutralizing monoclonal Abs, and DNAM-1 gene-targeted mice to determine the relative importance of DNAM-1-ligand interactions in controlling tumor metastases. Our results demonstrate that NK cells require DNAM-1 for natural or cytokine (IL-2, IL-12, or IL-21) suppression of tumor metastases or their variants expressing CD70 or CD80. In contrast, DNAM-1 was dispensable when tumor cells were targets of Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or presented ligands for NKG2D. CD155 appeared to be a key ligand recognized by DNAM-1 in NK cell-mediated suppression of metastases, and DNAM-1-mediated suppression coincided with perforin activity. Overall, these data implied a general role for DNAM-1-CD155 interactions in NK cell-mediated killing of tumors, even in the presence of tumor CD70 or CD80 expression, and further defined the optimal efficacy requirements of cytokines that directly activate NK cells.

Variables such as tissue lipid stores, plasma indicators of nutritional status and chronic stress and white muscle were used to define energetic and physiological status. Results showed that northern males (48° N) were larger and heavier than mid-northern (44° N) and southern (36° N) latitude males. For a given body size, northern males had greater whole-body lipid across the parental care period and tended to feed more (based on gut contents) than mid-northern and southern latitude conspecifics. Indicators of nutritional status were also highest in northern males. Conversely, the southern males exhibited the greatest capacity for biosynthesis across the entire parental care period as indicated by the highest level of nucleoside diphosphate kinase activities. Collectively, these finding suggest that the energetic costs and physiological consequences of care vary across latitudes, providing some of the first mechanistic evidence of how environmental conditions can influence both the ecological and physiological costs of reproduction for wild animals during parental care. The data also suggest that lake-specific processes that can vary independently of latitude may be important, necessitating additional research on fish reproductive physiology across landscapes. © 2010 The Authors.

In particular, little is known about the influence of brood predation pressure on the physiology of parents engaged in care. Brood defense, even when there is no direct threat to the parent, can be costly as it requires constant vigilance and chasing predators to protect the developing brood and maintain parental investment (i.e., fitness). Our goal was to examine the influence of natural variation in nest predation pressure on the physiology of the teleost smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, an animal that provides sole-paternal care for developing offspring. More specifically, we used indicators of anaerobic (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) and aerobic capacity (cytochrome c oxidase [CCO] and citrate synthase [CS]) in axial white muscle and pectoral red muscle to test for differences in antipredator performance of nest guarding males across six lakes with natural variation in nest predation pressure. Pectoral red muscle enzyme activities and protein concentrations were highly conserved among populations, while axial white muscle showed differences in LDH activities, CCO activities and protein concentrations. However, there was no evidence for higher metabolic capacities in fish from lakes with increased brood predation pressure. Clearly, factors other than predation pressure have a greater influence on white muscle metabolic capacities. Additional research is needed to clarify the extent to which biotic and abiotic factors influence the enzyme activity and organismal performance in wild animals, particularly at the level of the individual and population. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Relative to controls, neither GnRH nor T treatment resulted in significantly greater ovarian or testicular growth, but co-treatment significantly increased ovarian growth after 5 months. Interestingly, the stimulation was undetectable after 3 months. However, once daily photoperiod began shortening after the summer solstice, c. 2 months before the natural spawning date, GnRH+T-treated females were stimulated to produce larger ovaries. Final fish body length and the size of individual eggs did not differ among treatment groups. GnRH+T eggs, however, showed signs of advanced vitellogenesis relative to GnRH-treated and control eggs, whereas T-treated eggs became atretic. Testis size increased significantly from initial values and most males were spermiating, but this growth and development were independent of hormone treatments. Final plasma ion, metabolite and cortisol concentrations did not differ among treatment groups. It is concluded that GnRH+T co-treatment was effective in stimulating female but not male maturation.

In this study, we report cloning and expression of seven genes of the GST family of the pufferfish Takifugu obscurus together with mRNA tissue distribution pattern and time-course of expression in response to exposure to cadmium. At basal levels of tissue expression, GST-Mu is highly expressed in liver compared with other tissues. When fish were exposed to cadmium (5 mg/L for 96 h), expression of GST-MAPEG, GST-Mu, GST-Omega, and GST-Zeta was greatly increased, whereas GST-Alpha and GST-Kappa genes showed no significant response. These findings suggest that gene expression of a number of GST isoforms in T. obscurus is modulated in response to exposure to cadmium. We propose GST-Mu, GST-Theta, and GST-Zeta as candidate biomarkers for heavy metal exposure in this fish. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, no studies have addressed the role of endogenous IL-21 in tumor immunity. In this study, we have studied both primary and secondary immune responses in IL-21-/- and IL-21R-/- mice against several experimental tumors. We found intact immune surveillance toward methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas in IL-21-/- and IL-21R -/- mice compared with wild-type mice and B16 melanomas showed equal growth kinetics and development of lung metastases. IL-21R-/- mice showed competent NK cell-mediated rejection of NKG2D ligand (Rae1β) expressing H-2b- RMAS lymphomas and sustained transition to CD8 + T cell-dependent memory against H-2b+ RMA lymphomas. α-Galactosylceramide stimulation showed equal expansion and activation of NKT and NK cells and mounted a powerful antitumor response in the absence of IL-21 signaling, despite reduced expression of granzyme B in NKT, NK, and CD8+ T cells. Surprisingly, host IL-21 significantly restricted the expansion of Ag-specific CD8+ T cells and inhibited primary CD8 + T cell immunity against OVA-expressing EG7 lymphomas, as well as the secondary expansion of memory CD8+ T cells. However, host IL-21 did not alter the growth of less immunogenic MC38 colon carcinomas with dim OVA expression. Overall, our results show that endogenous IL-21/IL-21R is not required for NK, NKT, and CD8+ T cell-mediated tumor immunity, but restricts Ag-specific CD8+ T cell expansion and rejection of immunogenic tumors, indicating novel immunosuppressive actions of this cytokine.

BMR thus constitutes the minimum metabolic rate that is required for maintenance. Interspecific variation in BMR in birds is correlated with food habits, climate, habitat, flight activity, torpor, altitude, and migration, although the selective forces involved in the evolution of these presumed adaptations are not always obvious. I suggest that BMR constitutes the minimum level required for maintenance, and that variation in this minimum level reflects the fitness costs and benefits in terms of ability to respond to selective agents like predators, implying that an elevated level of BMR is a cost of wariness towards predators. This hypothesis predicts a positive relationship between BMR and measures of risk taking such as flight initiation distance (FID) of individuals approached by a potential predator. Consistent with this suggestion, I show in a comparative analysis of 76 bird species that species with higher BMR for their body mass have longer FID when approached by a potential predator. This effect was independent of potentially confounding variables and similarity among species due to common phylogenetic descent. These results imply that BMR is positively related to risk-taking behaviour, and that predation constitutes a neglected factor in the evolution of BMR. © 2009 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.","Anti-predator behaviour; Basal metabolic rate; Flight initiation distance","adaptation; antipredator defense; bioenergetics; bird; body mass; climate effect; flight activity; interspecific variation; metabolism; phylogenetics; torpor; animal; animal behavior; article; basal metabolic rate; bird; flying; high risk behavior; physiology; Animals; Basal Metabolism; Behavior, Animal; Birds; Flight, Animal; Risk-Taking; Aves"

Results showed that manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), catalase (CAT), thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx), selenium dependant glutathione peroxidase (SeGPx), and thioredoxin-2 (TRx-2) transcripts were expressed differently in gills, and that they respond collectively as a classical enzymatic antioxidant defense system in abalone. Comparative analysis of expression profiles indicated that CAT, TPx and SeGPx transcripts were significantly up-regulated (p < 0.05) by all three physical stress conditions - thermal (28 °C), salinity (25‰) and hypoxia - relative to levels in respective controls. In contrast, CuZnSOD and TRx-2 transcription were down-regulated in response to thermal stress. Interestingly, all the antioxidant transcripts exhibited significant up-regulation in response to salinity-related stress. Meanwhile, hypoxia caused up-regulation of the MnSOD, CAT, TPx and SeGPx, but not the CuZnSOD and TRx-2 transcripts. One of the most significant outcomes was the more than 10-fold induction of SeGPx, suggesting that SeGPx is a potential biomarker gene among antioxidant enzymes, under conditions of physical stress. The effects of physical stress on the transcriptional responses of immune functional genes namely suppressor of cytokine signaling-2 (SOCS-2) and myxovirus resistance (Mx) were investigated. We observed that salinity and hypoxia increase both the SOCS-2 and Mx transcripts, while thermal stress at 28 °C exerts less of an effect, producing mixed transcriptional responses (both up and down regulation). Based upon these results, we postulate that abalones utilize antioxidant and immune defense mechanisms together to overcome physical stresses. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated journals based on metrics in two categories: (1) citation-based measures of the influence of a journal on the scientific literature, and (2) measures of the cost-effectiveness of a journal (citation rate adjusted for subscription cost). Over the long-term, we found that ecology journals had far stronger citation-based influence than fisheries and aquatic sciences journals, and that journals publishing primarily basic research had stronger influence than journals publishing applied research (including four AFS journals and Fisheries magazine). In evaluating the current status of fisheries and aquatic sciences journals, we found that metrics of influence and cost-effectiveness provided considerably different portrayals of journals relative to their peers. In terms of citation-based influence, we found that the AFS journal Transactions of the American Fisheries Society (TAFS) and Fisheries magazine were competitive with highly regarded peer fisheries journals, but that North American Journal of Aquaculture (NAJA) and Journal of Aquatic Animal Health (JAAH) were less influential than their peers. The citation-based influence of North American Journal of Fisheries Management (NAJFM) was intermediate between TAFS/Fisheries and NAJA/JAAH. For journals like NAJFM and NAJA, we expect that much of the scientific influence on policy and management is not captured by citations in the primary literature, and alternative methods of evaluation may be needed. All of the AFS journals ranked highly with regard to cost-effectiveness because their subscription costs are low, and these rankings are in accordance with membership needs and the strategic mission of AFS to provide broad and timely dissemination of scientific information. We conclude by suggesting ways to increase the influence of AFS journals without compromising their accessibility and affordability, and offer advice about methods and frequency for future journal evaluations. © 2009.",,"Animalia"

Information is largely missing regarding the routes of transmission between individuals and the species of concern for transmission. Moreover, evolutionary comparative studies only considered ecological factors and ignored other potential determinants of virus transmission. Such determinants include the mating strategies of hosts because links between sexual selection and parasites are well known. Here, we show that morphological adaptations associated with copulation frequency in both male and female hosts strongly explain differences in low-pathogenic influenza prevalence among wild duck species. Prevalence is negatively related to male phallus length and female vaginal complexity, traits that evolved due to sexual conflict over forced copulations. This pattern suggests a hitherto unrecognized transmission route of the virus via copulation and subsequent mother-offspring transfer. Due to a relationship between forced copulations and the expression of white wing covert patches, male covert patch expression and sexual dichromatism in covert patch expression are positively related to influenza prevalence. Our results suggest that the arms race between male and female reproductive tracts had epidemiological consequences. Our findings further suggest that morphological correlates of sexual selection in ducks, including conspicuous plumage ornamentation, could be robust clues to identify high-risk host species during the large-scale monitoring of avian influenza.","Forced copulation; Plumage ornament; Reproductive anatomy; Viral transmission; Waterfowl","anatomy; avian influenza; copulation; disease prevalence; disease transmission; domestic species; epidemiology; plumage; sexual selection; waterfowl; Anas; Anatidae; Aves"

We investigated the ability of modified α-GalCer molecules to differentially modulate alloreactivity and GVL. KRN7000 and the N-acyl variant, C20:2, were administered in multiple well-established murine models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The highly potent and specific activation of all type I NKT cells with C20:2 failed to exacerbate and in most settings inhibited GVHD late after transplantation, whereas effects on GVL were variable. In contrast, the administration of KRN7000 induced hyperacute GVHD and early mortality in all models tested. Administration of KRN7000, but not C20:2, was found to result in downstream interleukin (IL)-12 and dendritic cell (DC)-dependent natural killer (NK)- and conventional T-cell activation. Specific depletion of host DCs, IL-12, or donor NK cells prevented this pathogenic response and the induction of hyperacute GVHD. These data demonstrate the ability of profound iNKT activation to modulate both the innate and adaptive immune response via the DC-NK-cell interaction and raise concern for the use of α-GalCer therapeutically to modulate GVHD and GVL effects. © 2009 by The American Society of Hematology.",,"1 o (alpha galactopyranosyl) 2 hexacosanoylamino 1,3,4 octadecanetriol; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; T lymphocyte receptor; tumor necrosis factor alpha; alpha galactosylceramide; alpha-galactosylceramide; cytokine; galactosylceramide; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; cytokine production; dendritic cell; female; fluorescence activated cell sorting; graft versus host reaction; graft versus leukemia effect; immunomodulation; interferon production; invariant natural killer T cell; leukemia cell line; mouse; natural killer T cell; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; spleen cell; T lymphocyte activation; allotransplantation; animal; biosynthesis; chemistry; drug effect; immunology; lymphocyte activation; stem cell transplantation; survival rate; T lymphocyte; treatment outcome; Animals; Cytokines; Female; Galactosylceramides; Graft vs Leukemia Effect; Lymphocyte Activation; Mice; Natural Killer T-Cells; Stem Cell Transplantation; Survival Rate; T-Lymphocytes; Transplantation, Homologous; Treatment Outcome"

While sexual selection theory regarding female mate choice is well developed, there are few mechanistic studies of the process by which females evaluate reproductive partners. Using paternal-careproviding smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) as a model, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between female mate choice and the morphological and physiological status of chosen males. This was accomplished by locating nests within 1 d of spawning and categorizing brood size (indicator of female mate choice). This was followed by capture of parental males, which were blood sampled (for nutritional analyses), digitally photographed (for morphometric analyses), and released. Principal components analysis (PCA) of morphometric measurements described 72.7% of the variance associated with body morphology and generated three principal components (PCs) indicative of fusiform body shape, increased posterior size, and body stoutness. PCA of nutritional indicators described 75.4% of the variance associated with physiological metrics and generated two PCs indicative of plasma mineral content (Ca++ and Mg+) and energetic condition (total protein, triglyceride, and cholesterol). Male total length and body stoutness were the only significant predictors of female mate choice. Interestingly, no nutritional indicators were predictive of female mate choice, and there were no direct relationships between morphological variables and nutritional physiology indicators. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanistic relationships between morphology and nutritional physiology (especially in relation to the parental-care period) of individual fish to determine the basis of female mate preference. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

These signals have recently been shown to be influenced by maternal effects. Indeed, yolk-derived carotenoids are essential for embryos to develop efficient carotenoid metabolism in posthatching life. Maternal effects facilitate adaptation to environmental variability and influence the evolution of phenotypic traits such as secondary sexual signals. Here we propose that maternal investment in yolk carotenoids promotes the evolution of carotenoid-based ornaments. We conducted a comparative analysis of lipid-soluble antioxidants (carotenoids and vitamins A and E) in the eggs of 112 species of bird. Species with large clutch sizes deposited higher yolk concentrations of the three antioxidants. There was a significant positive relationship between yolk carotenoids and the expression of male carotenoid-based signals, but not between yolk carotenoids and sexual dichromatism in these signals. These relationships were specific to carotenoids, as they were not found for vitamins A and E. This provides evidence consistent with the hypothesis that maternal effects mediated by yolk carotenoids play a role in the evolution of carotenoid-based signals as a response to sexual selection, likely based on organizational effects of carotenoids during embryo development. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Carotenoids; Egg composition; Sexual dichromatism; Sexual selection; Vitamin A; Vitamin E","alpha tocopherol; antioxidant; carotenoid; retinol; adaptation; antioxidant; bird; carotenoid; clutch size; color; comparative study; embryonic development; environmental change; hypothesis testing; life history trait; mate choice; maternal effect; metabolism; ornamentation; parental investment; phenotype; sexual selection; vitamin; animal; article; bird; color; comparative study; egg yolk; female; histology; male; mate choice; metabolism; physiology; reproduction; Animals; Antioxidants; Birds; Carotenoids; Color; Egg Yolk; Female; Male; Mating Preference, Animal; Reproduction; Vitamin A; Vitamin E; Aves"

In this study, a histone H2A full-length cDNA was cloned from disk abalone Haliotis discus discus. We identified a 40-amino acid AMP designated as abhisin from the N-terminus of the abalone histone H2A sequence. Abhisin shows the characteristic features of AMPs including net positive charge (+13), higher hydrophobic residues (27%) and 2.82 kcal/mol protein binding potential. Abhisin shares 80% amino acid identity with the buforin I peptide that is derived from Asian toad histone H2A. We synthesized the synthetic peptide of abhisin, and characterized its antimicrobial activities. Our results showed the growth inhibition of Gram positive (G+) Listeria monocytogenes, Gram negative (G-) Vibrio ichthyoenteri bacteria, and fungi (yeast) Pityrosporum ovale by abhisin treatment at 250 μg/mL. However, stronger activity was displayed against the G+ than G- bacteria. Additionally, scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation results confirmed that P. ovale cells were damaged by abhisin treatment. Interestingly, abhisin treatment (50 μg/mL) decreased the viability of THP-1 leukemia cancer cells approximately by 25% but there was no effect on the normal vero cells, suggesting that abhisin has cytotoxicity against cancer cells but not normal cells. Quantitative real time RT-PCR results revealed that histone H2A transcription was significantly induced at 3 h post-infection with bacteria in abalone gills and digestive tract. These results suggest that abhisin is a potential antimicrobial agent, and its precursor histone H2A may be involved in the innate immune defense system in abalone. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), parental males provide sole care for the developing brood that includes an increase in activity during brood defense and decreased foraging resulting in a decline in endogenous energy reserves. No mechanisms have been proposed for cessation of voluntary foraging, though regulation of appetite hormones such as ghrelin have been documented to affect feeding behavior in other fishes. We documented baseline fluctuations in plasma ghrelin concentrations across parental care. Plasma ghrelin concentrations were lowest during the early stages of parental care before increasing as the brood developed to independence. Additionally, we performed an intervention experiment whereby plasma ghrelin levels were artificially increased through an injection of rodent ghrelin at the onset of parental care. Despite measuring a significant increase in plasma ghrelin approximately 1 week after injection, we noted no differences in plasma-borne indicators of recent foraging activity indicating that voluntary anorexia is possibly reinforced by receptor insensitivity to appetite hormones. Finally, we assessed the ultimate consequences of foraging during parental care by feeding fish to satiation and measuring post-prandial changes in swimming performance and aggression. Fish fed to satiation showed significant decreases in burst swimming ability and aggressiveness towards potential brood predators. Voluntary anorexia during smallmouth bass parental care is an adaptive behavior that avoids potentially deleterious declines in swimming performance and aggression apparently through a modulation of production and reception of appetite hormones including ghrelin. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The recombinant proteins of HdGSTO1 and HdGSTO2 showed glutathione-dependent thioltransferase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities; however, no activity towards other common GST substrates was detected. Of the two genes, protein encoded by HdGSTO1 showed much higher catalytic ability than the other one. HdGSTO1 mRNA was expressed ubiquitously with high levels in all examined tissues, while HdGSTO2 showed specific expression in gonad and digestive tract. The transcriptional levels of HdGSTO1 in gill were dramatically elevated when abalones were subjected to heat shock, heavy metals and endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure, indicating that HdGSTO1 might play important protective roles against environmental stress. HdGSTO2 expression was also significantly induced by heavy metals and EDCs although with much lower fold change than HdGSTO1. But under thermal stress, HdGSTO2 expression was repressed in a time-dependent pattern, implying its different physiological roles under stress. These results indicate that omega GSTs of the disk abalone, especially HdGSTO1, have great potentials as highly sensitive biomarkers of environmental stress. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection requires the concerted activities of both innate and adaptive immune effectors. In the mouse, immunity to acute murine CMV (MCMV) infection depends on natural killer (NK) cells and/or CD8 + T cells. The relative importance of NK and CD8 + T cells varies in different mouse strains. In C57BL/6 mice, early viral infection is controlled by Ly49H + NK cells, whereas in BALB/c mice, CD8 + T cells exert the principal antiviral activities. Although the role of NK and CD8 + T cells is defined, the molecular mechanisms they utilize to limit acute infection are poorly understood. Here, we define the specific roles of perforin (pfp) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in the context of NK- or T-cell-mediated immunity to MCMV during acute infection. We show that pfp is essential for both NK- and T-cell-mediated antiviral immunity during the early stages of infection. The relative importance of IFN-γ is more pronounced in Ly49H - mice. Using BALB/c background mice congenic for Ly49H and lacking pfp, we show that Ly49H-regulated NK-cell control of MCMV infection is dependent on pfp-mediated cytolysis. © 2009 Australasian Society for Immunology Inc.

Studies in vitro have shown that SOCS-1 binds to Jaks and inhibits their catalytic activity, but recent studies indicate SOCS-1 may act in a similar manner to SOCS-3 by firstly interacting with cytokine receptors and then inhibiting Jak activity. Here, we have generated mice, termed Ifngr1441F, in which a putative SOCS-1 binding site, tyrosine 441 (Y441), on the IFN-γ receptor subunit 1 (IFNGR1) is mutated. We confirm that SOCS-1 binds to IFNGR1 in wild-type but not mutant cells. Mutation of Y441 results in impaired negative regulation of IFN-γ signaling. IFN-γ-induced STAT1 activation is prolonged in Ifngr1441F cells, but not to the extent seen in cells completely lacking SOCS-1, suggesting that SOCS-1 maintains activity to modulate IFN-γ signaling via other mechanisms. Despite this, we show that hypersensitivity to IFN-γ results in enhanced innate tumor protection in Ifngr1441F mice in vivo, and unregulated expression of an IFN-γ-dependent chemokine, monokine-induced by IFN-γ. Collectively, these data indicate that Y441 contributes to the regulation of signaling through IFNGR1 via the recruitment of SOCS-1 to the receptor.

Pre-clinical models clearly demonstrate that chemotherapy can synergize with immunotherapy, raising the question how the immune system can be mobilized to generate anti-tumor immune responses in the context of chemotherapy. Methods and Findings: We used a mouse model of malignant mesothelioma, AB1-HA, to investigate T cell-dependent tumor resolution after chemotherapy. Established AB1-HA tumors were cured by a single dose of cyclophosphamide in a CD8 T cell- and NK cell-dependent manner. This treatment was associated with an IFN-α/β response and a profound negative impact on the anti-tumor and total CD8 T cell responses. Despite this negative effect, CD8 T cells were essential for curative responses. The important effector molecules used by the anti-tumor immune response included IFN-γ and TRAIL. The importance of TRAIL was supported by experiments in nude mice where the lack of functional T cells could be compensated by agonistic anti-TRAIL-receptor (DR5) antibodies. Conclusion: The data support a model in which chemotherapy sensitizes tumor cells for T cell-, and possibly NK cell-, mediated apoptosis. A key role of tumor cell sensitization to immune attack is supported by the role of TRAIL in tumor resolution and explains the paradox of successful CD8 T cell-dependent anti-tumor responses in the absence of CD8 T cell expansion. © 2009 van der Most et al.",,"alpha interferon; beta interferon; cyclophosphamide; death receptor 5; death receptor 5 antibody; gamma interferon; gemcitabine; mafosfamide; monoclonal antibody; perforin; polyinosinic polycytidylic acid; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; cyclophosphamide; gamma interferon; TNFSF10 protein, human; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer inhibition; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell mediated cytotoxicity; chemosensitization; concentration response; controlled study; dose response; drug potentiation; female; gene expression regulation; immune response; immunogenicity; liver toxicity; lymphocyte depletion; lymphocyte proliferation; malignant mesothelioma; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; protein function; single drug dose; animal; apoptosis; Bagg albino mouse; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cytology; drug effect; immunology; immunotherapy; metabolism; methodology; neoplasm; nude mouse; tumor cell line; Mus musculus; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell Line, Tumor; Cyclophosphamide; Female; Immunotherapy; Interferon-gamma; Killer Cells, Natural; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Neoplasms; TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand"

We studied lifetime arrival patterns in the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica L.) in relation to variation in ecological conditions, as reflected by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Sub-Saharan winter quarters and at stopover sites in North Africa. 2. Migratory birds have recently advanced their arrival dates, but the relative role of microevolution and phenotypic plasticity as mechanisms of response to changing environmental conditions remains unknown. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we investigated the change in the arrival date using cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. 3. We predicted that the effect (i.e. slopes) of environmental conditions in stopover or winter areas on arrival date should be similar using cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses in case phenotypic plasticity is the underlying mechanism, or they should differ in case microevolution is the mechanism. 4. As expected according to a previous cross-sectional study, we found an advance in the arrival date when ecological conditions improve in stopover areas and a delay in the arrival date when ecological conditions improve in the winter quarters. 5. Change in the arrival time at the breeding grounds due to ecological conditions found en route and, in the winter areas, was mainly due to phenotypic plasticity as shown by similarities in the slopes found in these relationships using cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. 6. We also investigated sex and age of barns swallows as sources of variation in the arrival time with respect to conditions experienced in winter and stopover areas. We found that earlier arrival at the breeding grounds due to prevailing ecological conditions found en route in North Africa was similar for males and females of all age-classes. In contrast, individuals tended to delay departure when ecological conditions improved in the winter quarters, but this delay differed among age classes, with old individuals delaying departure more than middle-aged and yearling birds. 7. The migratory response of individuals to changing climatic conditions experienced during different parts of their life provides evidence for individuals responding differently to prevailing conditions in the winter quarters depending on their age, but not to conditions experienced en route during spring migration. © 2009 British Ecological Society.","Barn swallow; Bird migration; Climate change; Phenology; Senescence","arrival date; behavioral response; climate conditions; environmental conditions; migratory population; NDVI; passerine; phenology; phenotypic plasticity; senescence; stopover; age; animal; article; biological model; female; male; phenotype; physiology; population migration; season; sex difference; swallow (bird); weather; Age Factors; Animal Migration; Animals; Female; Male; Models, Biological; Phenotype; Seasons; Sex Factors; Swallows; Weather; Aves; Hirundinidae; Hirundo; Hirundo rustica"

However, there is a need to both expand the ""toolbox"" available to practitioners and to validate these tools for use in this context. This synthetic report details the behavioural, energetic, genomic, molecular, forensic, isotopic, and physiological tools available for studying sub-organismal responses of fish to hydropower infrastructure and operating procedures with a critical assessment of their benefits and limitations. Furthermore, this paper provides two case studies where behavioural, energetic, and physiological tools have been used in hydropower settings. Progressive and interdisciplinary approaches to hydropower research are needed to advance the science of sustainable river regulation and hydropower development. The expanded toolbox could be used by practitioners to assess fishway performance, migration delays, and fish responses to fluctuating flows through a more mechanistic approach than can be offered by only focusing on population metrics or indices of community structure. These tools are also relevant for the evaluation of other anthropogenic impacts such as water withdrawal for irrigation or drinking water, habitat alteration, and fisheries interactions.","Anthropogenic impacts; Enzymes; Genomics; Ions; Pacific salmonids; Telemetry","Anthropogenic impacts; Biological response; Community structures; Critical assessment; Drinking water; Fish response; Genomics; Hydro-power development; Low flow; Migration delay; Operating procedures; Operating strategy; Pacific salmonids; River regulation; Telemetry; Water withdrawal; Catalysts; Enzymes; Fish; Fisheries; Fishways; Meats; Potable water; Telemetering equipment; Water supply; Physiological models; Salmonidae"

We sampled a suite of aquatic and terrestrial variables (i.e., water quality, aquatic and terrestrial macrophytes, soil compaction, anthropogenic refuse) at 14 high shoreline angling-activity sites (identified by way of interviews with conservation officers and angling clubs) within an urban area (Ottawa, Canada). For each high angling-activity site, a nearby corresponding low angling-activity site was sampled for comparison. We found that the percentage of barren area and soil compaction were greater in areas of high angling activity compared with areas that experienced relatively low angling activity. In addition, terrestrial and aquatic macrophyte density, height, and diversity were lower at high angling-activity sites. Angling- and non-angling-related litter was present in large quantities at each of the high angling-activity sites, and comparatively little litter was found at low angling-activity sites. Collectively, these findings indicate that shoreline angling does alter the riparian environment, contributing to pollution and environmental degradation in areas of high angling intensity. With growing interest in providing urban angling opportunities and in response to increasing interest in developing protected areas and parks, a better understanding of the ecologic impacts of shoreline angling is necessary to address multiuser conflicts, to develop angler outreach and educational materials, and to optimize management of angling effort to maintain ecologic integrity of riparian and aquatic ecosystems. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Angling litter; Conservation; Ecosystem health; Macrophyte; Riparian; Shoreline angling; Soil compaction","Angling litter; Ecosystem health; Macrophyte; Riparian; Shoreline angling; Soil compaction; Ecosystems; Ocean habitats; Parks; Refuse compaction; Soil mechanics; Soils; Waste disposal; Water pollution; Water quality; Soil conservation; angling; compaction; ecosystem health; macrophyte; mortality; nature conservation; riparian zone; shoreline; urban area; aquatic environment; article; Canada; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; environmental protection; fishing; macrophyte; recreation; riparian ecosystem; seashore; soil compaction; Animals; Biodiversity; Canada; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Fishes; Recreation; Urban Population; Canada; North America; Ontario [Canada]; Ottawa"

Therefore, study of their expression serves as biomarker of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The self-fertilizing fish, Kryptolebias marmoratus has been established as a model species for testing the action of EDCs. To use this fish as a model for assessing estrogenic activity of EDCs on Chg expression, two K. marmoratus choreogenin genes, Km-ChgH and Km-ChgL were cloned and their expression was analyzed in different tissues and in developmental stages by real-time RT-PCR. Expression levels of liver mRNA were compared between hermaphrodites and secondary males after exposure to EDCs. Km-ChgH and Km-ChgL genes that were predominantly expressed in liver contained zona pellucida (ZP) domains. During embryonic development, low expression of mRNA was observed at stage 1 (2 dpf) that reached highest level at stage 4 (12 dpf) or stage 5 (5 h post hatching). The expression of Km-Chg mRNAs was highly increased in liver exposed to natural estrogen, 17α-estradiol (E2) as well as EDCs such as bisphenol A and 4-n-nonylphenol in both the gender types. Another EDC, 4-tert-octylphenol, showed modulatory effect only on Km-ChgH in hermaphrodites. Tamoxifen, an antagonist of the estrogen receptor showed no effect on expression of Chg genes in either of the gender types of K. marmoratus. These findings indicate that Km-Chg genes would be associated with estrogen and measurement of their expression would serve as a surrogate biomarker of exposure to environmental EDCs. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, a large number of genes have been identified from this species and their mRNA expression has been studied independently against exposure to marine environmental pollutants. T. japonicus is a promising organism for the study of mechanistic aspects of marine environmental pollutants using genomics. In this study, a 6K oligochip for T. japonicus that included mostly unique sets of genes from ∼26K ESTs, was developed. A total of 5463 spots (2313 mRNAs upregulated and 3150 downregulated) were identified to be significantly expressed on microarray by hierarchical clustering of genes after exposure to copper for different time durations (10 μg/L for 6, 12 and 24 h). However, mRNAs of only 138 and 375 genes were observed to be consistently upregulated and downregulated, respectively, at all time points. Most of the changes of mRNA expression were observed at the short exposure of 6 h. It was observed that mRNA expression of several genes involved in growth, metabolism, reproduction and hormonal regulation was modulated in Cu-exposed T. japonicus. mRNA expression of genes involved in detoxification and antioxidant functions was also modulated. This indicates that Cu-induced gene transcription is complicated in T. japonicus similar to other crustaceans. Cu specifically upregulated mRNAs of genes of some isoforms of cytochrome P450 (CYP). On the other hand, a majority of downregulated mRNAs were of genes encoding for proteins important for growth and development. The expression profile of mRNAs of selected genes was verified by the quantitative real time RT-PCR. The mRNA expression profiles provide insight into the mechanism of action of copper in T. japonicus. These results demonstrate the suitability of a T. japonicus oligochip microarray for risk assessment of trace metals in the marine environment. As yet, major breakthroughs in invertebrate toxicogenomics have mainly been in Daphnia and Drosophila. Daphnia's use is limited to freshwater ecotoxicogenomics.

In a meta-analysis of 16 studies of ten species of birds including 49 estimates of effect size from experimental studies, we show that induction of an immune response in a diverse group of bird species may determine oxidative stress (variance explained: 4.1%), but, most notably, may determine changes in oxidative stress markers (variance explained: 15.0%). These conclusions were robust to control for sampling effort and publication bias.

One of the central hypotheses of sexual selection theory is that large or elaborate male 'ornaments' may signal high genetic quality (good genes). Good genes are thought to be those associated with disease resistance and as diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has been shown to equate to superior immune responses, we test whether the peacock's train reveals genetic diversity at the MHC. We demonstrate via a captive breeding experiment that train length of adult males reflects genetic diversity at the MHC while controlling for genome-wide diversity and that peahens lay more, and larger, eggs for males with a more diverse MHC, but not for males with longer trains. Our results suggest that females are assessing and responding to male quality in terms of MHC diversity, but this assessment does not appear to be via train length, despite the fact that train length reflects MHC diversity. © 2009 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.","Good genes; Maternal effects; Sexual selection","bird; captive breeding; disease resistance; genetic analysis; immune response; maternal effect; sexual selection; animal; article; clutch size; female; Galliformes; genetic variability; genetics; major histocompatibility complex; male; oocyte; oviparity; sexual development; Animals; Clutch Size; Female; Galliformes; Genetic Variation; Major Histocompatibility Complex; Male; Oviparity; Ovum; Sex Characteristics"

A laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the recovery dynamics of physiological indicators of stress resulting from a simulated angling event resulting in exhaustion, with and without additional air exposure of 300 s. In addition, a field study using a combination of physiological and behavioural assessment was conducted to assess the long-term consequences of exhaustive exercise and various air exposure durations. Exhaustive exercise for 60 s led to increased muscle lactate, decreased tissue energy stores, and alterations in plasma ionic status. Recovery from physiological disturbance was rapid with all physiological variables except plasma glucose returning to baseline levels after 6 h. The recovery profile was largely unaffected by air exposure of 300 s that simulated extended de-hooking time. The field component of our study verified the impact of exhaustive exercise on blood lactate values, but did not detect any impact of air exposure varying between 0 s and 300 s on physiological stress indicators. However, pike exposed to air for 300 s were behaviourally impaired in the first hour post-release indicating that despite limited effects on physiological status air exposure resulted in significant impairment of organismal performance. Behavioural patterns returned to normal within several hours. In a three-week post-release monitoring period no mortality occurred. Our results emphasize that angling-induced stressors result in physiological and behavioural disturbances, but that recovery is quick. This suggests that pike are relatively resilient to catch-and-release related stressors but air exposure durations should be kept <300 s to minimize behavioural impairment. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The P. nana mtDNA is 15,981 bp in length (70.9% AT) and consists of 37 genes (12 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs, 23 tRNAs) that are atypical for metazoan mitogenomes. Unusually, it contains an extra tRNA (tRNA-Ala) but it does not contain the ATPase 8 gene. The P. nana mitogenome has a long putative control region with high AT content (1351 bp, 77.0% AT). The Cyt b was considerably short in length, compared to other crustaceans. Compared to typical mitogenomes of arthropods and copepods, the gene order of the P. nana mitogenome is highly rearranged with a novel gene structure. In addition, P. nana has highly divergent mt genes (mostly less than 50%), judged by amino acid substitution.

We used wild largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides as a model to evaluate the long-term impacts of telemetry devices on fish physiology and nutritional condition in a closed freshwater lake where recapture rates were reasonably high. Between 2003 and 2005, 68 fish were surgically implanted with acoustic telemetry devices. Between 2005 and 2008, 17 of the tagged fish were recaptured after carrying a transmitter for 335 to 1402 d. Incision sites were examined, and individuals were non-lethally sampled for blood and measured prior to release. Plasma samples were analysed, and physiological measures of stress (glucose, Na +, Cl -, K +), tissue damage (aspartate aminotransferase), and nutritional status (Ca ++, Mg +, phosphorus, total protein, triglycerides, cholesterol) were compared between fish carrying transmitters and temporally- and size-matched controls. Of the 17 recaptured fish, 3 retained at least 1 of the absorbable monofilament sutures and showed localised signs of inflammation and infection despite an elapsed time of 362 d post surgery. Five individuals showed signs of pressure necrosis at the incision site despite the fact that the transmitters averaged only 1.89% (range: 0.84 to 3.59%) of the body mass. There was no difference in any physiological parameter measured between the 2 groups, or within the telemetered fish, in relation to days since tagging or condition of the incision site. In summary, transmitter implantation was not correlated with any long-term change in any of the physiological parameters investigated. However, there is opportunity for additional research to optimise surgical techniques, guidelines on transmitter mass to body mass ratios, and choice of suture material to enhance the healing and long-term welfare of tagged fish. © Inter-Research 2009.","Body condition; Fish; Nutritional physiology; Surgical techniques; Telemetry","acoustics; animal welfare; blood; body condition; body mass; cation; chloride; freshwater ecosystem; glucose; nutritional status; perciform; physiology; potassium; sodium; tagging; telemetry; wild population; animal; animal disease; animal food; article; body composition; fish; instrumentation; physiology; telemetry; time; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Body Composition; Fishes; Telemetry; Time Factors; Micropterus; Micropterus salmoides"

The level of melanization of the throat increased with age in both sexes, but particularly in females. In contrast, the black colour of the plumage of the back was unrelated to age in both sexes. 4. These age-dependent patterns of colouration of different feather tracts of male and female barn swallows suggest that effects of senescence are trait-specific depending on their importance in sexual signalling. The red throat colour based on pheomelanin is involved in sexual selection, with a strong effect in males, but not in females. In contrast, the black colour of the back based on eumelanin is unrelated to sexual selection, but is under natural selection due to intense abrasion of this feather tract. 5.

The characteristics of species that have successfully managed to expand their range into urban areas remain largely unexplored, although they are of general interest in a world that is increasingly urbanised. I hypothesised that widely distributed species with high dispersal abilities, species with a high rate of innovation, a high level of risk-taking, and a fast life history would have a selective advantage in habitats influenced by humans. Consistent with this hypothesis, in a comparative analysis of 39 independent evolutionary events of urbanisation of birds in the Western Palearctic (thus taking the fact that closely related species that have become urbanised are caused by common phylogenetic descent rather than convergent evolution), bird species that adapted to urban habitats were characterised by large breeding ranges, high propensity for dispersal, high rates of feeding innovation (novel ways of acquiring food), short flight distances when approached by a human, and a life history characterised by high annual fecundity and high adult survival rate. Urban species may be disproportionately resistant to parasitism and predation because they had disproportionately strong immune responses, as reflected by the size of the bursa of Fabricius, and a history of weak predation-mediated natural selection, as reflected by the force required to remove feathers from the rump. Urban species had high overall ecological success as indicated by large range size and population size and high population density. This suggests that a suite of ecological features providing them with general ecological success characterises species of birds that have successfully invaded urban environments. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Invasion; Life history; Parasitism; Risk-taking; Urbanisation","anthropogenic effect; comparative study; dispersal; evolution; fecundity; immune response; Palearctic Region; parasitism; phylogeny; population density; range size; spatial distribution; survival; urban ecosystem; urbanization; adaptation; animal; animal behavior; article; bird; body weight; bursa Fabricii; clutch size; demography; feeding behavior; flying; histology; organ size; physiology; population dynamics; Russian Federation; survival; urban population; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Birds; Body Weight; Bursa of Fabricius; Clutch Size; Demography; Feeding Behavior; Flight, Animal; Homing Behavior; Organ Size; Population Dynamics; Russia; Survival Analysis; Urban Population; Aves"

Using two species of male black bass (smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu; largemouth bass, M. salmoides) as a model, the focus of this study was to determine the biochemical and hematological indicators of change in nutritional status and potential for chronic stress. This was accomplished by randomly sampling individuals at four stages across parental care. Additionally, a subset of individuals was repeatedly sampled at three brood development stages to track changes in biochemical factors within the individual. Though there were changes in physiological factors across parental care in randomly sampled fish of both species (declines in plasma glucose in largemouth bass; decreases in hematocrit and plasma chloride in smallmouth bass), repeated sampling of individuals was determined to be a more appropriate sampling technique due to natural variability in biochemical factors among individual fish. Repeated sampling of smallmouth bass did not adversely influence physiological metrics or brood abandonment. However, there were higher incidences of nest abandonment in repeatedly sampled largemouth bass. Amongst the repeatedly sampled smallmouth bass, nutritional indicators such as plasma triglyceride levels decreased indicating individual fasting across the majority of parental care. Increases in plasma calcium and magnesium towards the end of care indicated that feeding most likely resumed when the brood was close to independence after ∼3 weeks of care. Lastly, several indicators of chronic stress, such as plasma glucose and chloride levels, increased throughout the parental care period. These sublethal stressors are indicative of decreasing body condition associated with prolonged activity and fasting which may have marked impacts on the ability of an individual to continue parental care for the current brood and impact subsequent individual fitness. Further research into the mechanistic relationships between behaviour, physiology, and energetics during the parental care period will provide a better understanding of the decisions by individuals facing multiple trade-offs that ultimately lead to differences in individual fitness. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Energetics; Individual variation; Largemouth bass; Parental care; Physiology; Smallmouth bass","calcium; magnesium; triacylglycerol; analysis of variance; animal; animal food; article; bass; blood; blood analysis; Canada; comparative study; glucose blood level; hematocrit; nesting; paternal behavior; physiology; species difference; Analysis of Variance; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Bass; Blood Chemical Analysis; Blood Glucose; Calcium; Hematocrit; Magnesium; Nesting Behavior; Ontario; Paternal Behavior; Species Specificity; Triglycerides; Micropterus; Micropterus dolomieu; Micropterus salmoides; Perciformes"

Recently, sequences and expression of some oncogenes and tumor suppressor gene have been studied in K. marmoratus. To get a better understanding of oncogene expression at different development stage, and in different tissues three R-ras genes were cloned and fully sequenced. Expression of these R-ras genes (R-ras1, R-ras2, R-ras3) was also studied in fish exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Liver showed the highest level of expression compared to other tissues, even though each R-ras gene showed different expression patterns in tissues. Interestingly, in secondary male (ovary atresia stage), expression levels of three R-ras genes was lower compared to hermaphrodites. At different developmental stages, R-ras2 gene showed most pronounced expression at early embryogenesis but at stage 5 (hatchling stage) and juvenile stage, R-ras3 gene showed the highest expression. After the juvenile stage, R-ras1 gene was upregulated compared to other R-ras genes, which showed the highest expression at the hermaphroditic stage.

We found evidence of a difference in the effects of normalized difference vegetation index in North and West Africa on mean arrival date of male barn swallows, with the effect differing significantly between populations. Second, there was a significant interaction between ENSO and population on dispersal rate, showing that conditions in Africa during winter differentially affected dispersal in the two populations. Finally, the NAO index in winter had an effect on yearling survival that differed between populations.

The biotelemetry study compared dissolved oxygen levels measured throughout the winter period with continually tracked locations of nine adult largemouth bass obtained from a whole-lake submerged telemetry array. Fish habitat usage was compared with habitat availability to assess whether fish were selecting for specific dissolved oxygen concentrations. The laboratory study examined behavioral and physiological responses to progressive hypoxia in juvenile largemouth bass acclimated to winter temperatures. Results from the dissolved oxygen measurements made during the biotelemetry study showed high variance in under-ice dissolved oxygen levels. Avoidance of water with dissolved oxygen <2.0 mg/L by telemetered fish was demonstrated, but significant use of water with intermediate dissolved oxygen levels was also found. Results from the lab experiments showed marked changes in behavior (i.e., yawning and vertical movement) at <2.0 mg/L of dissolved oxygen but no change in tissue lactate, an indicator of anaerobic metabolism. Combined results of the biotelemetry and laboratory studies demonstrate that a dissolved oxygen content of 2.0 mg/L may be a critical threshold that induces behavioral responses by largemouth bass during the winter. In addition, the use by fish of areas with intermediate levels of dissolved oxygen suggests that there are multiple environmental factors influencing winter behavior. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

Birds have traditionally been assumed to senescence slowly despite their high metabolic rates, high blood sugar levels and high body temperature. Here we investigate the patterns of age-related performance of sperm of a long distance migrant, the barn swallow Hirundo rustica, varying in age from 1 to 6 years, analysed by the computer-assisted sperm analysis equipment. Sperm showed deteriorating performance in terms of linear movement, track velocity, straight line velocity and reduced proportions of rapidly moving, progressive and motile sperm with age. In a second series of experiments, we assessed performance of sperm from the same males in neutral medium and in medium derived from the reproductive tract of females in an attempt to test if sperm of old males performed relatively better in female medium, as expected from extra-pair paternity being negatively related to male age, but not to female age. Older males showed consistently better performance in female medium than in neutral medium in terms of track velocity, straight line velocity and reduced proportions of rapidly moving, progressive and motile sperm, whereas young males showed better performance in neutral medium. These results provide evidence of declining sperm performance for important reproductive variables not only with age, but also with the sperm of old males performing differentially better in female medium than young males. © 2008 The Authors.","Ageing; Barn swallow; Ejaculates; Female effects; Hirundo rustica","age class; aging; experimental study; long range transport; migration; mutation; passerine; performance assessment; senescence; sperm; aging; animal; article; female; male; physiology; spermatozoon; swallow (bird); Aging; Animals; Female; Male; Spermatozoa; Swallows; Aves; Hirundo; Hirundo rustica"

In this study we show that blockade of the NKG2A-mediated inhibitory signal with antagonistic anti-NKG2A/C/E mAb (20d5) aggravated Con A-induced hepatitis in wild-type, Fas ligand (FasL)-mutant gld, and IL-4-deficient mice even with NK cell and CD8 T cell depletion, but not in perforin-, IFN-γ-, or IFN-γ- and perforin-deficient mice. Consistently, 20d5 pretreatment augmented serum IFN-γlevels and perforin-dependent cytotoxicity of liver mononuclear cells following Con A injection, but not their FasL/Fas-dependent cytotoxicity. However, blockade of NKG2A-mediated signals during the cytotoxicity effector phase did not augment cytotoxic activity. Activated iNKT cells promptly disappeared after Con A injection, whereas NK1- iNKT cells, which preferentially expressed CD94/NKG2A, predominantly remained in the liver. Pretreatment with 20d5 appeared to facilitate disappearance of iNKT cells, particularly NK1- iNKT cells. Moreover, Con A-induced and α-galactosylceramide-induced hepatic injury was very severe in CD94/NKG2A-deficient DBA/2J mice compared with CD94/NKG2A-intact DBA/2JJcl mice.

Among the Hsps, the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family members are most extensively studied for their characterization and induction in response to environmental stressors in a range of species. We studied expression of ten Hsp transcripts in response to heat treatment in an intertidal marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus and observed that expression of Hsp70 was more pronounced than other Hsps. Subsequently, cDNA and genomic sequences of T. japonicus Hsp70 (TJ-Hsp70) were worked out by molecular cloning techniques and phylogenetic relationship was analyzed. The bacterial expression of TJ-Hsp70 and its expression in response to metal and endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) exposures were also studied. The TJ-Hsp70 transformed bacteria showed increased thermotolerance compared to bacteria with vector only. All the trace metals (i.e. copper, silver, and zinc) caused a concentration-dependent increase in the expression of Hsp70 transcripts. Effect of EDCs on Hsp70 expression was differential. While 4-nonylphenol (NP) and 4-t-octylpheno (OP) caused downregulation, bisphenol A (BPA) caused upregulation. The promoter region of the genomic Hsp70 sequence contained putative xenobiotic response elements (XREs) indicating that TJ-Hsp70 regulation not only by temperature but also by xenobiotics. These findings suggest that in T. japonicus, Hsp70 has a conserved role of thermotolerance and its expression in response to xenobiotics exposure appears to be a protective response. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Although all the development stage showed some level of MT expression, the adult hermaphrodites showed the highest expression which was significantly higher than the secondary males. In the trace metal-exposed fish, cadmium caused the strongest induction of MT. However, other trace metals such as copper and zinc also caused MT gene induction. All the EDCs suppressed the expression of MT gene, and the effect of EDCs were not gender-specific. K. marmoratus has previously shown its suitability as a model species for toxicity studies and cancer research. This study demonstrated utility of MT as biomarker in K. marmoratus. However, confounding factors such as age, gender, and tissue types appear to influence the MT expression. Response of trace and organic pollutants such as EDCs also varied greatly.

OCIL was originally identified as an osteoblast-derived inhibitor of osteoclast formation in vitro. To determine the physiological function(s) of OCIL, we generated ocil-/- mice. These mice appeared healthy and were fertile, with no apparent immune function defect, and phenotypic abnormalities were limited to bone. Histomorphometric analysis revealed a significantly lower tibial trabecular bone volume and trabecular number in the 10- and 16-week-old male ocil-/- mice compared with wild type mice. Furthermore, ocil-/- mice showed reduced bone formation rate in the 10-week-old females and 16-week-old males while Static markers of bone formation showed no significant changes in male or female ocil-/- mice. Examination of bone resorption markers in the long bones of ocil-/- mice indicated a transient increase in osteoclast number per unit bone perimeter. Enhanced osteoclast formation was also observed when either bone marrow or splenic cultures were generated in vitro from ocil-/- mice relative to wild type control cultures. Loss of ocil therefore resulted in osteopenia in adult mice primarily as a result of increased osteoclast formation and/or decreased bone formation. The enhanced osteoclastic activity led to elevated serum calcium levels, which resulted in the suppression of circulating parathyroid hormone in 10-week-old ocil-/- mice compared with wild type control mice.

We investigated associations between host ecology and life history, and parasite richness and prevalence of the four major avian blood parasite genera. We used an extensive data on blood parasite infections and host ecology in 263 bird species from the Western Palearctic, combining species-specific data with a comparative approach to control for similarity in phenotype among host species due to the effects of common phylogenetic descent. Adult survival rate negatively correlated with the number of parasite species infecting a host species when controlling for similarity due to common descent and body mass. In addition, the prevalence of Haemoproteus, Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon was higher in species harbouring a richer parasite assemblage.

As this behaviour potentially inflicts direct costs on females, they are currently hypothesized to search for genetic benefits for descendants, either as 'good' or 'complementary' genes. Although these hypotheses have found some support, several studies failed to find any beneficial consequence of EPC, and whether this behaviour is adaptive to females is subject to discussion. Here, we test these two hypotheses in a natural population of blue tits by accounting for the effect of most parameters known to potentially affect extrapair fertilization. Results suggest that female body mass affected the type of extrapair genetic benefits obtained. Heavy females obtained extrapair fertilizations when their social male was of low quality (as reflected by sexual display) and produced larger extrapair than within-pair chicks. Lean females obtained extrapair fertilizations when their social mate was genetically similar, thereby producing more heterozygous extrapair chicks.

Our approach to this challenge was to study migratory Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), fish whose lifetime fitness hinges on a once-in-a-lifetime river migration to natal spawning grounds. Here, we suggest that their thermal optimum for aerobic scope is adaptive for river migration at the population level. We base this suggestion on several lines of evidence. The theoretical line of evidence comes from a direct association between the temperature optimum for aerobic metabolic scope and the temperatures historically experienced by three Fraser River salmon populations during their river migration. This close association was then used to predict that the occurrence of a period of anomalously high river temperatures in 2004 led to a complete collapse of aerobic scope during river migration for a portion of one of the sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations. This prediction was corroborated with empirical data from our biotelemetry studies, which tracked the migration of individual sockeye salmon in the Fraser River and revealed that the success of river migration for the same sockeye population was temperature dependent. Therefore, we suggest that collapse of aerobic scope was an important mechanism to explain the high salmon mortality observed during their migration. Consequently, models based on thermal optima for aerobic scope for ectothermic animals should improve predictions of population fitness under future climate scenarios. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

Remarkably, treatment with a combination of anti-DR5 and anti-ErbB-2 mAbs induced complete response in a majority of mice. In vivo blockade of CD11b+ cells, but not natural killer cell depletion, significantly abrogated the early antitumor response. Notably, depletion of CD8+ T cells provoked primary and secondary tumor relapse, revealing the induction of antitumor immunity by the combination treatment. Combined therapy with anti-DR5 and anti-ErbB-2 mAbs further significantly suppressed the growth of advanced spontaneous tumors in ErbB-2/neuT transgenic mice, even when treatment was delayed until tumors were palpable. We thus demonstrated that the combination of anti-DR5 and anti-ErbB2 mAbs might be an effective form of treatment for ErbB-2-overexpressing breast cancer. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Apoptosis; Breast cancer; Herceptin; Immunity","CD11b antigen; death receptor 5; death receptor 5 monoclonal antibody; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; epidermal growth factor receptor 2 monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; article; Bagg albino mouse; breast cancer; cancer inhibition; cancer relapse; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; drug effect; immune response; killer cell; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; therapy effect; transgenic mouse; treatment response; tumor growth; tumor immunity; tumor immunology; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line; Drug Synergism; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Immunotherapy; Mice; Receptor, erbB-2; Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand; Time Factors; Mus; Mus musculus"

However, some species may not have advanced their timing of breeding sufficiently to continue reproducing optimally relative to the occurrence of peak food availability, thus becoming mismatched compared with their food sources. The degree of mismatch may differ among species, and species with greater mismatch may be characterized by declining populations. Here we relate changes in spring migration timing by 100 European bird species since 1960, considered as an index of the phenological response of bird species to recent climate change, to their population trends. Species that declined in the period 1990-2000 did not advance their spring migration, whereas those with stable or increasing populations advanced their migration considerably. On the other hand, population trends during 1970-1990 were predicted by breeding habitat type, northernmost breeding latitude, and winter range (with species of agricultural habitat, breeding at northern latitudes, and wintering in Africa showing an unfavorable conservation status), but not by change in migration timing. The association between population trend in 1990-2000 and change in migration phenology was not confounded by any of the previously identified predictors of population trends in birds, or by similarity in phenotype among taxa due to common descent. Our findings imply that ecological factors affecting population trends can change over time and suggest that ongoing climatic changes will increasingly threaten vulnerable migratory bird species, augmenting their extinction risk. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Conservation; Extinction risk; Migration phenology; Population trends","Africa; agriculture; article; bird; breeding; climate change; habitat; latitude; migratory species; nonhuman; phenology; priority journal; reinforcement; spring; winter; Animal Migration; Animals; Birds; Climate; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Time Factors; Animalia; Aves"

Killing tumor cells in a manner that provides danger signals and tumor antigens in the right context promotes the engagement of innate and adaptive immunity; however, this response alone will not be effective against established cancer. Coincidently driving the immune response with specific monoclonal antibodies and other immunomodulators that activate and mature dendritic cells and co-stimulate T cells and other lymphocytes is one approach. Additionally releasing immune checkpoints and inhibiting tumor-derived molecules that prevent effective tumor immunity is another. Combined these approaches have enormous potential to improve the current outcomes from conventional cancer therapy. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the potential mechanisms behind the positive interspecific correlation between T and latitude remain unexplored. In a comparative study of more than 100 bird species, we examined whether social constraints during male-male competition arising from migration and breeding synchrony are responsible for the latitude effects. Species that breed at higher latitudes are more likely to migrate and experience more intense intrasexual competition upon spring arrival than nonmigrant species from lower latitudes. Additionally, species from higher latitudes cope with shorter breeding seasons and thus with more synchronous breeding, which selects for high T titers via increased male-male conflicts. Accordingly, peak T levels were associated with migration and the duration of the egg laying period that reflects breeding synchrony. Because migration and breeding synchrony were related to latitudinal distribution, they appear to be important components of the latitude effects on T. A multivariate model controlling for covariation of predictor variables revealed that latitude remained the strongest predictor of peak T. Therefore, selection due to migration and breeding synchrony may partially cause the latitude effect, but other geographically varying factors may also play a role in mediating peak T levels at different latitudes. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

In this study, expression of ten glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes was studied in the copepods exposed to trace metals. Expression of these genes was also studied against exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) used as a positive control with prooxidant activity. Of all genes, expression of GST-Sigma (GSTS) was highly upregulated in H2O2 as well as trace metal-exposed copepods. In the time-course study, expression of GSTS mRNA was more consistent compared to other GSTs such as GST-Omega, GST-Delta1, GST-Theta3 or microsomal GST1 (mGST1). GSTS is predominantly reported from the insects. Coupled with the previous study of the in vitro antioxidant role of T. japonicus GSTS, these findings imply an antioxidant role for GSTS and highlight its importance as a biomarker of exposure to trace metals in T. japonicus.

So far, there is no information on antioxidant defense or detoxification genes from T. clavigera. We cloned the full length cDNA sequence for a Mu-class of GST gene from T. clavigera (Tc-GSTM) and purified recombinant Tc-GSTM protein by bacterial expression. The deduced amino acid sequence of Tc-GSTM exhibited 45 to 66% identity with other Mu-class GSTs. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed highest expression of Tc-GSTM in gill, while reproductive organs showed low expression. The biochemical characteristics of purified recombinant Tc-GSTM were typical, and thus Tc-GSTM showed highest specific activity for the universal GST substrate, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). After exposure to prooxidant H2O2, transformed Escherichia coli containing Tc-GSTM showed higher survival rate compared to control bacteria without expressed Tc-GSTM. The present study reveals a conserved antioxidant role for GSTM in rock shells, and the tissue-specific differences in Tc-GSTM transcripts would partly reflect vulnerability of reproductive organs to chemically induced oxidative stress. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To test whether species with the highest metabolic rates also lived the longest I determined the relationship between relative longevity (maximum lifespan), after adjusting for annual adult survival rate, body mass and sampling effort, and mass-specific field metabolic rate (FMR) in 35 species of birds. There was a strongly positive relationship between relative longevity and FMR, consistent with the hypothesis. This conclusion was robust to statistical control for effects of potentially confounding variables such as age at first reproduction, latitude and migration distance, and similarity in phenotype among species because of common phylogenetic descent.

In this article, we show that the death signal mediated by TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor 2/death receptor 5 (DR5) may be a key regulator of cholestatic liver injury. Agonistic anti-DR5 monoclonal antibody treatment triggered cholangiocyte apoptosis, and subsequently induced cholangitis and cholestatic liver injury in a mouse strain-specific manner. TRAIL- or DR5-deficient mice were relatively resistant to common bile duct ligation-induced cholestasis, and common bile duct ligation augmented DR5 expression on cholangiocytes, sensitizing mice to DR5-mediated cholangitis. Notably, anti-DR5 monoclonal antibody-induced cholangitis exhibited the typical histological appearance, reminiscent of human primary sclerosing cholangitis. Human cholangiocytes constitutively expressed DR5, and TRAIL expression and apoptosis were significantly elevated in cholangiocytes of human primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis patients.

Growing embryos are particularly susceptible to the damaging effects of free radicals produced during rapid growth, and mothers of many species provide protection against such damage by allocating antioxidants to their eggs. Birds living in radioactively contaminated areas use dietary antioxidants to cope with the damaging effects of radiation, but females also allocate dietary antioxidants to eggs, potentially enforcing a physiological trade-off between self-maintenance and reproductive investment. Here we tested whether female great tits Parus major breeding in radioactively contaminated study areas near Chernobyl allocated less dietary antioxidants to eggs, and whether such reduced allocation of dietary antioxidants to eggs had fitness consequences. Concentrations of total yolk carotenoids and vitamins A and E were depressed near Chernobyl compared to concentrations in a less contaminated Ukrainian study area and a French control study area, and all antioxidants showed dose-dependent relationships with all three dietary antioxidants decreasing with increasing level of radiation at nest boxes. These effects held even when controlling statistically for potentially confounding habitat variables and covariation among antioxidants. Laying date was advanced and clutch size increased at nest boxes with high dose rates. Hatching success increased with increasing concentration of vitamin E, implying that hatching success decreased at boxes with high levels of radiation, eventually eliminating and even reversing the higher potential reproductive output associated with early reproduction and large clutch size. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that radioactive contamination reduced levels of dietary antioxidants in yolks, with negative consequences for hatching success and reproductive success. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Antioxidants; Clutch size; Dose rate; Hatching success; Laying date","alpha tocopherol; antioxidant; carotenoid; retinol; animal; article; chernobyl accident; clutch size; comparative study; diet; down regulation; ecosystem; egg yolk; female; fertility; metabolism; radiation exposure; radiation response; songbird; zygote; Animals; Antioxidants; Carotenoids; Chernobyl Nuclear Accident; Clutch Size; Diet; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Down-Regulation; Ecosystem; Egg Yolk; Female; Fertility; Passeriformes; Vitamin A; Vitamin E; Zygote; Aves; Parus major"

Vg measurement has been used as a biomarker of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Therefore, Vg gene structure has been identified from several species used in environmental monitoring of EDCs. Among the copepods, except from the salmon louse, there is no report on Vg genes or their products. By using molecular cloning, we determined the full Vg gene sequence from the intertidal copepod, Tigriopus japonicus. The full cDNA sequence was of 5692 bp containing 5529 bp of open reading frame (ORF) encoding for 1842 amino acids. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that T. japonicus Vg is distinct from the other arthropods as it formed a clade with salmon louse only. The expression of Vg transcripts was negligible in nauplii; detectable only at the copepodid stage 3. Females expressed over 270 times more Vg transcripts than males. The promoter sequence of T. japonicus Vg gene revealed an estrogen receptor (ER) half site and a metal response element (MRE). When copepods were exposed to trace metals, cadmium after 96 h exposure caused significantly higher induction of Vg transcripts. Taken together, molecular analysis of T. japonicus Vg would be helpful in understanding its role in development. Previous studies have established T. japonicus as a potential model for testing of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs).

An important challenge for ecologists is to identify the climatic factors that drive temporal variation in demographic parameters, and, ultimately, the dynamics of natural populations. The analysis of long-term monitoring data at the individual scale is often the only available approach to estimate reliably demographic parameters of vertebrate populations. We review statistical procedures used in these analyses to study links between climatic factors and survival variation in vertebrate populations. We evaluated the efficiency of various statistical procedures from an analysis of survival in a population of white stork, Ciconia ciconia, a simulation study and a critical review of 78 papers published in the ecological literature. We identified six potential methodological problems: (i) the use of statistical models that are not well-suited to the analysis of long-term monitoring data collected at the individual scale; (ii) low ratios of number of statistical units to number of candidate climatic covariates; (iii) collinearity among candidate climatic covariates; (iv) the use of statistics, to assess statistical support for climatic covariates effects, that deal poorly with unexplained variation in survival; (v) spurious detection of effects due to the co-occurrence of trends in survival and the climatic covariate time series; and (vi) assessment of the magnitude of climatic effects on survival using measures that cannot be compared across case studies. The critical review of the ecological literature revealed that five of these six methodological problems were often poorly tackled. As a consequence we concluded that many of these studies generated hypotheses but only few provided solid evidence for impacts of climatic factors on survival or reliable measures of the magnitude of such impacts. We provide practical advice to solve efficiently most of the methodological problems identified. The only frequent issue that still lacks a straightforward solution was the low ratio of the number of statistical units to the number of candidate climatic covariates.

Previously, we showed that some EDCs modulated the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppression gene, p53 in the hermaphroditic killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus. Exposure to EDCs may affect reproductive tissues including ovotestis of K. marmoratus not only through the estrogenic action but also by oxidative stress. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) provide antioxidant defense against oxidative stress in all the vital tissues. In this study, firstly, the full sequence of a cDNA clone of GST-Mu (GSTM) was identified by molecular cloning. The expression of GSTM was studied at different stages of development, and in the gonads of adult hermaphrodites and secondary males. Secondary males showed significantly lower expression of GSTM compared to hermaphrodites. When gonadal expression of GSTM was compared with other GSTs in the hermaphrodites, expression of GSTM was significantly higher than the others. Juvenile fish were exposed to three EDCs, bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP) and octylphenol (OP) for 24 h and expression GSTM transcript was studied at different time intervals. BPA at 12 and 24 h caused upregulation of GSTM whereas OP showed similar effect at 12 h only. NP, on the other hand, caused significant downregulation at 12 as well as 24 h. When adult fish of both the genders were exposed to EDCs, except NP, the other EDCs caused significant upregulation of GSTM mRNA expression in gonads. Expression of GSTM in the gonads of secondary males was more pronounced than in the hermaphrodites. These findings indicate that the gonad of K. marmoratus has a robust antioxidant system. The gender-related differences in GSTM expression imply a differential sensitivity to EDCs in gender type. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

How do fish migrate such vast distances? What are the costs and benefits of migration? Some of these fundamental questions have been addressed through the use of telemetry. However, telemetry alone has not and will not yield a complete understanding of the migration biology of fi sh or provide solutions to problems such as identifying physical barriers to migration or understanding potential impacts of climate change. Telemetry can be coupled with other tools and techniques to yield new insights into animal biology. Using Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) as a model, we summarize the advances that we have made in understanding salmonid migration biology through the integration of disciplines (i.e., interdisciplinary research) including physiology, behavior, functional genomics, and experimental biology. We also discuss opportunities for using large-scale telemetry arrays and taking a more experimental approach to studies of fish migration that use telemetry (i.e., intervention studies involving endocrine implants, simulated migration studies) rather than simply focusing on descriptive or correlational techniques. Only through integrative and interdisciplinary research will it be possible to understand the mechanistic basis of fi sh migrations and to predict and possibly mitigate the consequences of anthropogenic impacts. Telemetry is a tool that has the potential to integrate research across disciplines and between the lab and the field to advance the science of fish migration biology. The techniques that we have applied to the study of Pacifi c salmon are equally relevant to other fi sh taxa in both marine and freshwater systems as well as migratory animals beyond ichthyofauna. The interdisciplinary approach used here was essential to address a pressing and complex conservation problem association with sockeye salmon migration.",,"Animalia; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus nerka; Salmonidae"

In order to standardize T. japonicus for use in environmental risk assessment involving whole life cycle exposure, we tested nine pollutants for their effects on growth and reproduction during a two-generation life cycle exposure test. Nauplii (F0) were exposed to a range of concentrations of each chemical in a static renewal culture system. Broods of the second generation (F1) were subsequently exposed to the same concentrations for one full life cycle. Of the seven traits (nauplius phase, development time, survival, sex ratio, number of clutch, nauplii per clutch and fecundity), only the length of the nauplius phase and development time showed a greater sensitivity to chemical exposure. Between the two sensitive traits, the period of the nauplius phase was more sensitive than cohort generation time. Biocides significantly increased the maturation period of nauplii as well as copepodids in F0 generation. In this study, it was demonstrated that T. japonicus could also be used in reproduction and life cycle tests and it provides an opportunity for testing the chronic and subchronic toxic effects of marine pollutants. Further validation and harmonization in a multi-centric study involving other laboratories of the region will strengthen its use as a supplement to existing model species. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, the effect of an extract from a soft coral (Sinnularia maxima) on expression of hepatic CYP1A and CYP2 mRNAs was also examined. Fish were fed extracts on days 1, 3 and 5, and expression was examined on day 5. Phylogenetic analyses of the CYP1A cDNA from 12 species of butterflyfish (DNA, amino acid) indicate well-separated groupings according to their feeding strategies. The non-coralline feeding Chaetodon xanthurus exhibited a 7-fold higher basal expression of CYP2N8 relative to the other species studied. Although induction of CYP2N7 expression was observed in C. punctatofasciatus, CYP1A and CYP2N was largely unaffected or diminished by extract treatment in the other species of butterflyfish. These results indicated groupings of feeding strategy with CYP1A phylogeny in Chaetodon, but generally unaltered expression of CYP1A and CYP2N following dietary treatment with an extract from a chemically defended soft coral suggesting an inconclusive role of these isoforms in the detoxification of chemicals in these extracts. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Butterflyfish; Coral reefs; Cytochrome P450; Natural products","cytochrome P 450 CYP2N1 (killifish); cytochrome P-450 CYP2N1 (killifish); cytochrome P450; cytochrome P450 1A1; animal; Anthozoa; article; chemistry; classification; drug effect; enzymology; gene expression regulation; genetics; liver; metabolism; Perciformes; phylogeny; species difference; Animals; Anthozoa; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Gene Expression Regulation; Liver; Perciformes; Phylogeny; Species Specificity; Alcyonacea; Anthozoa; Chaetodon; Chaetodon punctatofasciatus; Chaetodon xanthurus; Chaetodontidae; Hexapoda"

Because of this uniqueness, there has been great interest in its biology, physiology, developmental biology and genomics along with other basic and applied areas of environmental genomics and molecular carcinogenesis. In laboratory studies, K. marmoratus has shown susceptibility to a number of xenobiotics including carcinogens. Toxicologists are interested in the mechanisms of action of environmental chemicals of contemporary interest such as endocrine disruptors and may consider this as a suitable fish model for the study of chemically induced carcinogenesis. Single short-term exposure to model chemical carcinogens is sufficient to induce tumourigenesis in K. marmoratus in a relatively short time span. In recent years, considerable data have been generated about gene sequences of K. marmoratus. Laboratory maintenance of K. marmoratus is relatively easy. Gene bank data are readily available, though not as extensive as for zebrafish Danio rerio or Japanese madaka Oryzias latipes. The expressed sequence tag (EST) data, differential display real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Gene Sequencer 20™ sequencing data have recently been helpful in understanding the genomics and proteomics of this species. Recently, sequences of the oncogene, ras, and tumour suppressor gene, p53, have been reported in K. marmoratus. The expression of these important genes that play significant roles not only in carcinogenesis but also in other signal transduction pathways was observed to be modulated by environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Having a large sequence database (cDNA sequences and ESTs), it is expected that the use of a microarray in the near future will open new vistas for this fish with applications in cancer research, aquatic toxicology, endocrinology and genomics.

To understand the seasonal variation of Cu sensitivity, individuals of T. japonicus were collected from the field in summer and winter, and subjected to standard 96h acute (static renewal) toxicity tests. 96h-LC50 values of T. japonicus collected from the two seasons were marginally different (p=0.05), with an overall coefficient of variation (CV) of 33%. Most importantly, our results indicated that chronic Cu sensitivity of T. japonicus was highly reproducible. The CVs of intrinsic rates of increase in the population of the control and Cu treatment (10μgCul -1) groups were only 10-11% between 10 runs of a standardised complete life-cycle test. Moreover, different Cu(II) salts generally resulted in a similar 96h-LC50 value while Cu(I) chloride was consistently slightly less toxic than Cu(II) salts.

We explored the therapeutic potential and in vivo toxicity of a combination of bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, and MD5-1, a tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor (DR5) agonist monoclonal antibody, in mouse carcinomas. Methods: Mice bearing Renca-FLAG (renal) or 4T1 (mammary) tumors were treated with bortezomib and/or MD5-1 and examined for lung metastases (Renca-FLAG: n = 93; 4T1: n = 40) or monitored for survival (Renca-FLAG: n = 143). Toxicity was assessed by histopathology and hematology. Viability and apoptotic signaling in Renca-FLAG and 4T1 cells treated with bortezomib alone or in combination with TRAIL were analyzed using 3-[4,5-dimethyiazol-2-yl-5]-[3-carboxymethyloxyphenyl]-2-[4-sulfophenyl]-2H tetrazolium assay and by measuring mitochondrial membrane depolarization and caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Bortezomib (20 nM) sensitized Renca-FLAG and 4T1 cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (mean percent decrease in numbers of viable cells, bortezomib + TRAIL vs TRAIL: Renca-FLAG, 95% vs 34%, difference = 61%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 52% to 69%, P <. 001; 4T1, 85% vs 20%, difference = 65%, 95% CI = 62% to 69%, P <. 001). Sensitization involved activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 but not mitochondrial membrane depolarization, suggesting an amplified signaling of the extrinsic cell death pathway.

As a model, we used three stocks of summer-run sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Fraser River watershed, British Columbia, to test the hypothesis that individual variation in migration speed is determined by a combination of environmental factors (i.e., water temperature), intrinsic biological differences (sex and population), and physiological and energetic condition. Before the freshwater portion of the migration, sockeye salmon (Quesnel, Chilcotin, and Nechako stock complexes) were captured in Johnstone Strait (∼215 km from river entry), gastrically implanted with radio transmitters, and sampled for blood, gill tissue, and energetic status before release. Analyses focused solely on individuals that successfully reached natal subwatersheds. Migration speeds were assessed by an extensive radiotelemetry array. Individuals from the stock complex that migrated the longest distance (Nechako) traveled at speeds slower than those of other stock complexes. Females traveled slower than males. An elevated energetic status of fish in the ocean was negatively correlated with migration speed in most river segments. During the transition from the ocean to the river, migration speed was negatively correlated with mean maximum water temperature; however, for the majority of river segments, it was positively correlated with migration speed. Physiological status measured in the ocean did not explain among-individual variability in river migration speeds. Collectively, these findings suggest that there could be extensive variation in migration behavior among individuals, sexes, and populations and that physiological condition in the ocean explained little of this variation relative to in-river environmental conditions and energetic status. Interestingly, individual fish generally retained their rank in swimming speed across different segments, except when transiting a challenging canyon midway during the migration. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

In this study, we have identified a GnRH receptor (GnRHR) gene from the hermaphroditic fish Kryptolebias marmoratus. K. marmoratus GnRHR showed typical vertebrate GnRHR domains and motifs, and its cDNA contained 1634 bp including an open reading frame (ORF) of 1263 bp encoding a putative protein of 420 amino acids. To analyze expression patterns of GnRHR gene in various tissues and developmental stages of K. marmoratus, we carried out quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The K. marmoratus GnRHR gene expression was detected in all the tissues of adult fish with highest level in brain and gonad. The expression of K. marmoratus GnRHR mRNA increased from stage 1 (2 day post fertilization, dpf) to stage 4 (12 dpf) but steeply decreased at hatching stage (stage 5). Expression of K. marmoratus GnRHR after exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals such bisphenol A (BPA, 600 μg/L for 96 h) and 4-tert-octylphenol (OP, 300 μg/L for 96 h) in hermaphrodites as well as secondary males was highly up-regulated in almost all the tissues. Another EDC, 4-nonylphenol (NP, 300 μg/L for 96 h) showed no consistent response. 17β-estrodiol (E2, 100 ng/L for 96 h), a known natural estrogen, suppressed expression of GnRHR in most of the tissues from hermaphrodites as well as secondary males. Tamoxifen (TMX, 10 μg/L), an estrogen antagonist, on the other hand, caused upregulation of GnRHR expression in the liver of hermaphrodites and the gonad and liver of secondary males. This is the first report of a GnRHR gene from K. marmoratus and modulation of its expression by EDCs.

Changes in the timing of reproduction arise from changes in food availability as well as other factors, and differences in the timing of reproduction among sites may cause sites with early reproduction to contribute disproportionately to local recruitment. In this study, spatial variation in the laying date of barn swallows Hirundo rustica at 39 sites in a 45-km2study area during the period 1971-2004 was used to investigate micro-geographic patterns in the timing of breeding. I found that individuals breeding at sites with early reproduction had a disproportionately large reproductive success. Early sites were characterized by early plant phenology, as determined by the date of leafing of the broad-leaved elm Ulmus glabra and date of flowering of the snowdrop Galanthus nivalis during a single year. Such early sites showed greater advancement in laying date between 1971 and 2004 than the average site. Early sites were also generally occupied during more years by a larger number of breeders than were late sites. Breeders at early sites produced more fledglings, and breeders at such sites were characterized by a smaller adult body size and larger secondary sexual characters than individuals at the average site. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that temporal changes in the timing of reproduction occur as a consequence of differential recruitment at phenologically early sites that produce disproportionately large numbers of offspring. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Barn swallow; Hirundo rustica; Phenology; Recruitment; Spatial patterns of reproduction; Timing of reproduction","breeding; climate change; deciduous tree; flowering; food availability; geographical variation; laying date; passerine; phenology; recruitment (population dynamics); secondary sexual characteristics; temporal variation; animal; article; body size; body weight; ecosystem; egg laying; female; greenhouse effect; male; physiology; regression analysis; swallow (bird); temperature; time; Animals; Body Size; Body Weight; Ecosystem; Female; Greenhouse Effect; Male; Oviposition; Regression Analysis; Swallows; Temperature; Time Factors; Aves; Galanthus; Galanthus nivalis; Hirundo; Hirundo rustica; Ulmus; Ulmus glabra"

Here, we analyzed in vitro proteomic profiles of Raw264.7 lysates treated with LF. In our experiments, neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) was found to be a fragment, suggesting that LF may act on nNOS cleavage. A similar cleavage of nNOS was shown in LeTx-challenged HEK293 cells expressing nNOS by a transient transfection. However, the cleavage site on nNOS is a unique leader sequence among the NOS family and this LF-mediated cleavage was not observed in iNOS, a major NOS isoform for anti-bactericidal NO production, even though NO level in LeTx-challenged cells was dramatically reduced. Our findings suggest that LF is directly capable of cleaving cellular protein(s) other than MKKs, and that these actions potentiate to promote the cytotoxic mechanisms of anthrax. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We cloned and deduced full-length sequence of cDNA of N-ras oncogene from K. marmoratus. Study of expression profile of N-ras by using quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that brain had the highest level of expression compared to other tissues. Some embryonic stages showed more N-ras expression than juveniles and adults. Exposure to two environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-nonylphenyl (NP) caused up-regulation of N-ras in gonad, intestine and liver of hermaphrodite K. marmoratus. It is suggested that K. marmoratus may be a suitable model species for oncogene expression studies.

The Complete cDNA sequences of K. marmoratus (Km-p53) gene was 1.8 kb in length. K. marmoratus p53 amino acid sequence showed a high degree of homology with the sequences from fishes, amphibians, and mammals. Although basal level of expression of Km-p53 mRNA was low, all the studied tissues showed some level of expression. After exposure of K. marmoratus to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as bisphenol A, 4-nonylphenol, and 4-tert-octylphenol, Km-p53 expression was significantly increased within 3 h of exposure in juveniles. However, expression was down-regulated by exposure to most of the EDCs when measured at 96 h in adult fish. In adult fish, suppressive effect of EDCs was more pronounced in liver as compared to other tissues. These findings suggest that Km-p53 gene would be involved in cellular defense mechanism in early stage of exposure to EDCs and long-term exposure may suppress its expression.

We obtained sperm samples from 98% of sampled birds, thus avoiding sampling bias due to the fraction of males not producing sperm samples. Analyses of within- and between-sample repeatability revealed significant and intermediate to large estimates for all sperm parameters. There were significant differences between the Chernobyl area and the control area for two of 11 sperm behaviour parameters, and significant interactions between area and year for six of these parameters. The proportion of sperm with abnormal morphology was elevated in barn swallows from Chernobyl. A principal component (PC) analysis revealed four significant axes that explained 88% of the variance in sperm behaviour parameters. One of these principal components differed between areas, and three components showed significant year by area interactions. PC2 representing the frequency of slow sperm increased with increasing radiation in one year, but not another. PC3 representing sperm with high linearity, small amplitude of lateral head displacement and low track velocity decreased with increasing background radiation level. PC4 reflecting a large proportion of static sperm with high beat cross frequency increased with increasing background radiation level. Sperm behaviour as reflected by principal components was predictable among years from information on level of radiation, and it was predictable among sites in different years. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that sperm behaviour and morphology have been affected by radiation due to the Chernobyl accident. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, attempts at therapeutic activation of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells with α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) during L. donovani infection exacerbated, rather than ameliorated, experimental visceral leishmaniasis. The inability of α-GalCer to promote anti-parasitic immunity did not result from inefficient antigen presentation caused by infection because α-GalCer-loaded bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were also unable to improve disease resolution. The immune-dampening affect of α-GalCer correlated with a bias towards increased IL-4 production by iNKT cells following α-GalCer stimulation in infected mice compared to naïve controls. However, studies in IL-4-deficient mice, and IL-4 neutralisation in cytokine-sufficient mice revealed that α-GalCer-induced IL-4 production during infection had only a minor role in impaired parasite control. Analysis of liver cell composition following α-GalCer stimulation during an established L. donovani infection revealed important differences, predominantly a decrease in IFNγ+ CD8+ T cells, compared with control-treated mice.

The basis of these discrepancies is unclear and may in part reflect differences in the negative selection models under investigation. Considering the importance of the negative selection process in the establishment of a competent immune system, it is essential that these discrepancies be fully resolved. In this study, we failed to identify a role for TRAIL in an acute model of peptide antigen-specific negative selection using a TCR transgenic system as well as antibody-mediated TCR/CD3 ligation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, thymic dendritic cells, the main cellular mediators of negative selection in the thymus, did not constitutively express TRAIL, and TRAIL receptor (DR5) expression was negative or extremely low on thymocytes. Furthermore, in vitro thymocyte deletion was normal in C57BL/ 6 TRAIL- gld mice, suggesting that TRAIL and FasL do not function cooperatively to induce negative selection. These results, combined with the fact that aged C57BL/6 TRAIL- mice showed no signs of spontaneous autoimmunity, strongly indicate that intrathymic negative selection occurs normally in the absence of TRAIL signaling. © The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2008.

Although river regulation plays an important role in modern society, there are potential consequences which may negatively affect fish and fish habitat. While much effort has been expended examining the response of fish to fluctuating flow regimes in different systems, there has been little in the way of a comprehensive synthesis. In an effort to better understand the effects of river regulation on fish and fish habitat, we conducted a systematic review of available literature with three goals: (1) summarize the various research methodologies used by regulated river researchers, (2) summarize the effects found on fish and fish habitat and (3) identify opportunities for future research. The results of the synthesis indicate that a wide variety of methodologies are being employed to study regulated river science, yet there is a gap in incorporating methodologies that examine effects on fish at a cellular level or those techniques that are interdisciplinary (e.g. behaviour and physiology). There is a clear consensus that modified flow regimes in regulated rivers are affecting fish and fish habitat, but the severity and direction of the response varies widely. Future study designs should include methods that target all biological levels of fish response, and in which detailed statistical analyses can be performed. There is also a need for more rigorous study designs including the use of appropriate controls and replicates. Data on physical variables that co-vary with flow should be collected and examined to add explanatory power to the results. Increased multi-stakeholder collaborations provide the greatest promise of balancing ecological concerns with economic needs.

In this study, we evaluate the relationship between morphology and swimming activity of wild largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) during the reproductive period, providing the first data derived on free-swimming fish not exposed to forced swim trials in the laboratory. Sixteen male largemouth bass were angled from their nests, telemetered, and subsequently monitored by a whole-lake acoustic hydrophone array with sub-meter accuracy. Additionally, eleven morphological measurements were taken from digital images of each fish. A principal components analysis of the morphological measurements described 79.8% of the variance. PC1 was characterized by measures of overall body stoutness, PC2 was characterized by measures of the length and depth of the caudal region, and PC3 characterized individuals with relatively large anterior portions of the body and relatively small caudal areas. Of these variables, only PC3 showed significant relationships to swimming activity throughout the parental care period. PC3 was negatively correlated with multiple measures of swimming activity across the parental care period. Furthermore, swimming performance of individual male bass was noted to be repeatable across the parental care period indicating that this phenomenon extends beyond the laboratory. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

IL-21 is produced mainly by activated CD4 + T cells and natural killer T cells and mediates its activity by binding to the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R), consisting of an IL-21-specific α chain (IL-21Rα; JAK/STAT) that heterodimerizes with the common γ chain (CD132). Intracellular signaling occurs through the Janus-activated kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathways. Physiologic expression of IL-21R is restricted to lymphoid tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells; however, other tissues such as epithelium, synovium, or transformed cells can acquire expression of both components of IL-21R heterodimer. IL-21 has complex activities on a wide variety of cell types, leading to enhancement of adaptive T-cell immunity, antibody production, activation of natural killer cell subtypes, and opposition to suppressive effects mediated by regulatory T cells. Functionally, these activities promote immune responses and point to a physiologic role of IL-21 in autoimmunity and immune enhancement.

In this study, we have developed a novel method involving retroviral transduction and in vitro T-cell polarization to generate gene-engineered mouse CD4+ Th1 and Th2 cells or T helper intermediate (Thi) cells expressing an anti-erbB2-CD28-ζ chimeric receptor. Gene-modified Th1 and Th2 polarized CD4+ cells were characterized by the preferential secretion of IFN-γ and interleukin-4, respectively, whereas Thi cells secreted both cytokines following receptor ligation. In adoptive transfer studies using an erbB2+ lung metastasis model, complete survival of mice was observed when transduced Th1, Th2, or Thi CD4+ cells were transferred in combination with an equivalent number of transduced CD8+ T cells. Tumor rejection was consistently associated with transduced T cells at the tumor site and interleukin-2 secretion. However, the surviving mice treated with gene-modified Th1 CD4+ cells were significantly more resistant to a subsequent challenge with a different erbB2+ tumor (4T1.2) implanted s.c. This result correlated with both increased expansion of Th1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the blood and a greater number of these cells localizing to the tumor site following rechallenge. These data support the use of gene-modified CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ T cells for mediating a sustained antitumor response. ©2007 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"CD28 antigen; chimeric protein; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; epidermal growth factor receptor antibody; gamma interferon; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; single chain fragment variable antibody; adoptive transfer; animal experiment; animal model; antigen specificity; article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; cytokine release; DNA modification; genetic engineering; human; human cell; immunotherapy; lung metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; viral gene delivery system; Adoptive Transfer; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Engineering; Interferon Type II; Interleukin-4; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Knockout; Mice, SCID; Perforin; Receptors, Cell Surface; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Survival Rate; Th1 Cells"

NK1.1- NKT cells in general are regarded as immature precursors of NK1.1+ NKT cells, meaning that peripheral NK1.1- NKT cells are regarded as a transient, semimature population of recent thymic emigrant NKT cells. In this study, we report the unexpected finding that most NK1.1- NKT cells in the periphery of naive mice are actually part of a stable, mature and functionally distinct NKT cell population. Using adult thymectomy, we show that the size of the peripheral NK1.1- NKT cell pool is maintained independently of thymic export and is not the result of NK1.1 down-regulation by mature cells. We also demonstrate that most peripheral NK1.1- NKT cells are functionally distinct from their immature thymic counterparts, and from NK1.1+ NKT cells in the periphery. We conclude that the vast majority of peripheral NK1.1- NKT cells are part of a previously unrecognized, mature NKT cell subset.

The current study sought to quantify the magnitude of physiological disturbances, recovery dynamics, and post-exercise behaviour in bonefish (Albula vulpes; a tropical marine fish) exposed to several different exercise and air exposure regimens. Results showed that metabolic disturbances (lactate production, hyperglycemia) increased following exercise and exposure to air, and that the magnitude of metabolic disturbance was proportional to the duration of the stressful event. Fish required between 2-4 h to return to resting values. Exercise and exposure to air also resulted in significant increases in plasma Ca2+, Cl- and Na+, but the magnitude of these ionic changes did not vary with exercise or exposure to air duration and required over 4-h to return to baseline levels. Mortality following exercise was observed only for fish that had been exposed to air for 3 min and not in fish that had been exposed to air for 1 min. Together, results from this study provide a physiological basis for management strategies that can improve the post-release survival of bonefish that have been caught during a catch-and-release angling event. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The full-length cDNA of ns-GST-O was 1562 bp in length, containing an open reading frame (OR) of 732 bp that encoded a 244 amino acid protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of ns-GST-O showed a low similarity with the theta class N. suucinea GST (ns-GST-T). As GSTs play a significant role in antioxidant defense, we checked the expression pattern of ns-GST-O in N. succinea after exposure to copper (CuCl2 12 to 72 μg/L), which is an oxidative stress-inducing agent. After exposure to CuCl2, ns-GST-O gene was dramatically up-regulated and when compared with ns-GST-T the expression pattern was more pronounced at all the concentrations of copper. Even the basal transcription levels of ns-GST-O were higher than those of ns-GST-T. To further characterize the catalytic properties of ns-GST-O, we constructed a recombinant ns-GST-O plasmid with a 6× His-Tag at the N-terminal of the full-length ns-GST-O cDNA. Recombinant ns-GST-O protein was highly expressed in transformed Escherichia coli. The effect of pH, temperature and chemical inhibitors on the enzyme activity of ns-GST-O was also studied and compared with the reported effect of these factors on recombinant ns-GST-T protein.

It was observed that H2O2 (2 mM) exposure down-regulated its expression at the initial stage but there was recovery and up-regulation shortly afterwards. In case of heavy metal exposure there was concentration-dependent increase in Tigriopus GST-S gene expression up to 24 h. These results suggest that Tigriopus GST-S expression is modulated by prooxidant chemicals and it may play a role against oxidative stress.

The harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus japonicus has a wide geographical distribution along the coast in the Western Pacific including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. This study evaluated the acute toxicity sensitivity profile of Tigriopus japonicus against 12 common toxic substances including six endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), three biocides and three trace metals. Through standard acute toxicity test procedures, toxicity endpoints LC50, LC10, and no observed effect concentration (NOEC) of each chemical were obtained. Although T. japonicus depicted different sensitivities towards different chemicals, a dose-response relationship was consistent in all cases. T. japonicus was particularly sensitive to most of the EDCs, but relatively less sensitive to molinate (a thiocarbate herbicide). Across all tested chemicals, tributyltin (TBT) was the most toxic to the copepod with the LC50, LC 10, and NOEC of 0.05, 0.03, and 0.02 mg/L, respectively. A comparison made with available data on acute toxicities of these chemicals to other marine copepod species revealed that T. japonicus is generally more sensitive to EDCs and in particular to TBT.

We investigated age-related changes in two reproductive traits (laying date and annual fecundity) in barn swallows Hirundo rustica L. using a mixed model approach to di-stinguish among between- and within-individual changes in breeding performance with age. 2. We tested predictions of age-related improvements of competence (i.e. constraint hypothesis) and age-related progressive disappearance of poor-quality breeders (i.e. selection hypothesis) to explain age-related increase in breeding performance in early life. 3. Reproductive success increased in early life, reaching a plateau at middle age (e.g. at 3 years of age) and decreasing at older age (> 4 years). Age-related changes in breeding success were due mainly to an effect of female age. 4. Age of both female and male affected timing of reproduction. Final linear mixed effect models (LME) for laying date included main and quadratic terms for female and male age, suggesting a deterioration in reproductive performance at older age for both males and females. 5. We found evidence supporting the constraints hypothesis that increases in competence within individuals, with ageing being the most probable cause of the observed increase in breeding performance with age in early life. Two mechanisms were implicated: (1) advance in male arrival date with age provided middle-aged males with better access to mates. Yearling males arrived later to the breeding grounds and therefore had limited access to high-quality mates. (2) Breeding pairs maintaining bonds for 2 consecutive years (experienced pairs) had higher fecundity than newly formed inexperienced breeding pairs. 6. There was no support for the selection hypothesis because breeding performance was not correlated with life span. 7. We found a within-individual deterioration in breeding and migratory performance (arrival date) in the oldest age-classes consistent with senescence in these reproductive and migratory traits. © 2007 The Authors.","Breeding experience; Constraints and selection hypothesis; Fecundity; Linear mixed effect models (LME); Longevity; Senescence; Timing of reproduction","breeding; fecundity; migration; passerine; reproductive success; senescence; age; aging; animal; article; breeding; egg laying; female; fertility; male; physiology; population migration; sexual behavior; sexual maturation; statistical model; swallow (bird); Age Factors; Aging; Animal Migration; Animals; Breeding; Female; Fertility; Linear Models; Male; Oviposition; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Sexual Maturation; Swallows; Aves; Hirundo; Hirundo rustica"

We evaluated how four generations of artificial truncation selection for vulnerability to recreational angling (i.e., stocks selected for high and low vulnerability [HVF and LVF, respectively]) affected cardiovascular physiology and parental care behavior in the teleost fish largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides. Where possible, we compared artificially selected fish to control fish (CF) collected from the wild. Although, compared to control fish, resting cardiac activity was ∼18% lower for LVF and ∼20% higher for HVF, maximal values did not vary among treatments. As a result, the HVF had less cardiac scope than either LVF or CF. Recovery rates after exercise were similar for HVF and CF but slower for LVF. When engaged in parental care activities, nesting male HVF were captured more easily than male LVF. During parental care, HVF also had higher turning rates and pectoral and caudal fin beat rates, increased vigilance against predators, and higher in situ swimming speeds. Energetics simulations indicated that to achieve the same level of growth, the disparity in metabolic rates would require HVF to consume approximately 40% more food than LVF. Selection for angling vulnerability resulted in clear differences in physiological and energetic attributes. Not only is vulnerability to angling a heritable trait, but high vulnerability covaries with factors including higher metabolic rates, reduced metabolic scope, and increased parental care activity. Despite these energetically costly differences, HVF and LVF of the same age were of similar size, suggesting that heightened food consumption in HVF compensated for added costs in experimental ponds. Ultimately, angling vulnerability appears to be a complex interaction of numerous factors leading to selection for very different phenotypes. If HVF are selectively harvested from a population, the remaining fish in that population may be less effective in providing parental care, potentially reducing reproductive output. The strong angling pressure in many freshwater systems, and therefore the potential for this to occur in the wild, necessitate management approaches that recognize the potential evolutionary consequences of angling. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

As the risk of virus transmission depends on the prevalence of LPAI in host-reservoir systems, there is an urgent need for understanding how host ecology, life history and behaviour can affect virus prevalence in the wild. To test for the most important ecological correlates of LPAI virus prevalence at the interspecific level, we applied a comparative analysis by using quantitative data on 30 bird species. We controlled for similarity among species due to common descent, differences in study effort and for covariance among ecological variables. We found that LPAI prevalence is a species-specific attribute and is a consequence of virus susceptibility, as it was negatively associated with the relative size of the bursa of Fabricius, an estimate of juvenile immune function. Species that migrate long distances have elevated prevalence of LPAI independent of phylogeny and other confounding factors. There was also a positive interspecific relationship between the frequency of surface feeding and virus prevalence, but this was sensitive to phylogenetic relatedness of species. Feeding in marine habitats is apparently associated with lower virus prevalence, but the effect of water salinity is likely to be indirect and affected by phylogeny. Our results imply that virus transmission via surface waters and frequent intra- and interspecific contacts during long migration are the major risk factors of avian influenza in the wild. However, the link between exploitation of surface waters and LPAI prevalence appears to be weaker than previously thought. This is the first interspecific study that provides statistical evidence that host ecology, immunity and phylogeny have important consequence for virus prevalence. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Anatidae; Bird flu; Feeding ecology; Migration; Prevalence; Risk assessment","avian influenza; comparative study; disease prevalence; disease transmission; host; interspecific interaction; migratory species; risk assessment; virus; article; avian influenza; controlled study; ecology; host pathogen interaction; immunity; Influenza virus; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; risk factor; virus transmission; Anatidae; Aves"

Withdrawal of IL-15 led to upregulation of Bim and, accordingly, both Bim-deficient and Foxo3a-/- NK cells were resistant to cytokine deprivation. Finally, IL-15-mediated inactivation of Foxo3a and cell survival were dependent on phosphotidylinositol-3-OH kinase.

DCs from nonlethal infections were fully functional and capable of secreting cytokines and stimulating T cells. In contrast, DCs from lethal infections were not functional. We then transferred DCs from mice with nonlethal infections to mice given lethal infections and showed that these DCs mediated control of parasitemia and survival. IL-12 was necessary for survival. To our knowledge, our studies have shown for the first time that during a malaria infection, DC function is essential for survival. More importantly, the functions of these DCs are determined by the strain of parasite. Our studies may explain, in part, why natural malaria infections may have different outcomes. © 2007 Wykes et al.",,"animal cell; animal experiment; article; cell survival; controlled study; cytokine release; dendritic cell; disease severity; female; immunostimulation; lethality; malaria; mouse; nonhuman; parasite survival; parasitemia; Plasmodium malariae; Plasmodium yoelii; strain identification; T lymphocyte activation; Mus; Plasmodium yoelii; Rodentia"

The complete mtDNA from L. obesus was 16,531 bp in length and contained 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and a control region, demonstrating a structure very similar to that of other bony fish. An analysis of the protein-coding genes revealed a statistically substantiated bias in (T + C): (A + G) content, supporting earlier findings regarding this peculiarity. As indicated by a chi-square test, the observed scores for pyrimidine and purine content were different from those expected assuming a 50:50 ratio: χ2 = 41.63, d.f. = 5, p &lt; 0.000001 for three categories, including the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd codon positions. Further, there was a difference in nucleotide content between ND6 and the other 12 protein-coding genes in L. obesus. The values of p-distances, as summarized for different scales of evolutionary history at the Cyt b gene, revealed a clear pattern of increased nucleotide diversity at four levels: (1) intraspecies, (2) intragenus, (3) intrafamily, and (4) intraorder. Scores of average p-distances of the four categories in catfish were (1) 1.59 ± 0.54%, (2) 5.28 ± 1.72% (3) 16.37 ± 1.26%, and (4) 19.81 ± 0.14%, respectively. These data support the hypothesis that speciation in the order Siluriformes, in most cases, follows a geographic mode through the accumulation of a numerous small genetic changes over a long time period. A phylogenetic tree for the bullhead torrent catfish and several other fish species belonging to the order Siluriformes was developed on the basis of respective Cyt b sequences (1138 bp); the analysis revealed a monophyletic origin for the five examined families. A species-specific clustering of sequences from single species was obtained, supporting additionally basic phylogenetic information for the catfish and the barcoding suitability of Cyt b sequence data. Lastly, one of the well-supported properties of our phylogenetic tree (99% repetition level in our analysis) was the monophyletic placement of all catfish (order Siluriformes) among other ray-finned fish of the class Actinopterigii.

Using both IFNAR1- and IFNAR2-deficient mice, as well as an IFNAR1-blocking Ab, we demonstrate that endogenous type I IFN is critical for controlling NK cell-mediated antitumor responses in many experimental tumor models, including protection from methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas, resistance to the NK cell-sensitive RMA-S tumor and cytokine immunotherapy of lung metastases. Protection from RMA-S afforded by endogenous type I IFN is more potent than that of other effector molecules such as IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-18, and perforin. Furthermore, cytokine immunotherapy using IL-12, IL-18, or IL-21 was effective in the absence of endogenous type I IFN, however the antimetastatic activity of IL-2 was abrogated in IFNAR-deficient mice, primarily due to a defect in IL-2-induced cytotoxic activity.

We generated recombinant N. succinea GST-T by expression in transformed Escherichia coli and studied the kinetic properties as well as the effects of inhibitors, pH, and temperature on N. succinea GST-T.

However, not all fish survive, and those that do often experience sublethal consequences including injury and stress. There is compelling scientific evidence that angler behavior and gear choice can affect the success of catch-and-release as a management and conservation strategy. Because anglers often look to government natural resource agencies for guidance on how to handle and release fish properly, there is a need to assess whether their outreach materials are readily accessible and provide the necessary and correct information on the subject. Therefore, on-line catch-and-release guidelines developed by state and provincial natural resource agencies across North America were evaluated to determine whether their guidelines were consistent with the best available scientific information. This analysis revealed that there was immense variation in the depth and breadth of coverage among jurisdictions. Agency guidelines contradicted one another in several areas including air exposure, angling in deep water, venting trapped gases, and resuscitation. In many cases, the guidelines failed to provide sufficient direction to actually be of use to anglers or provide direction consistent with contemporary scientific literature. This analysis will assist with developing outreach materials that promote sustainable recreational fisheries and in maintaining the welfare status of individual fish. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Catch-and-release; Education; Fisheries management; Outreach; Recreational fishing","Fisheries management; Recreational fishing; Trapped gases; Conservation; Education; Environmental management; Natural resources; Fisheries; air exposure; best management practice; catch composition; conservation status; deep water; education; fish; fishery management; gear selectivity; guideline; natural resource; recreational management; survival; animal welfare; article; environmental protection; fishery management; government; information center; North America; practice guideline; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Fisheries; Fishes; Food Contamination; Guidelines; Humans; North America; Risk Assessment; North America"

Yolk androgens in birds are a relatively well-known maternal effect and have been linked to adaptations related to development, coloniality life, and sexual selection. We tested whether interspecific patterns of yolk androgen levels (androstenedione and testosterone) were related to interspecific variation in development, sexual selection, and coloniality. First, we found no relationship between androgen levels and duration of development as reflected by incubation and nestling periods. However, androstenedione concentration was positively related to the relative duration of the incubation period and negatively related to the relative duration of the nestling period. These relationships were confirmed by analyses of phylogenetically independent contrasts. We suggest that androstenedione concentration may have evolved as a mechanism to shift the relative duration of development between the egg and nestling stages in response to selective pressures that differentially affect the duration of each stage. Second, neither plumage dichromatism nor mating system explained significant variation in yolk androgen levels after correction for similarity among species due to common descent. This finding indicates that sexual selection has not been an important selective pressure for this maternal effect. Third, we found a highly significant positive relationship between degree of breeding coloniality and concentration of androstenedione but not testosterone. These effects were confirmed in analyses of contrasts controlling for similarity due to common descent. Since the relationship with coloniality was different for each androgen, it is unlikely that increased levels of androgens in highly colonial species are a mere consequence of elevated androgen levels in mothers. Rather, our results suggest that high levels of androstenedione in eggs of colonial species are an adaptation to colony life, possibly related to the production of highly competitive phenotypes. In conclusion, from a comparative perspective, the results of this study support the role of maternal effects in promoting adaptation to certain environmental pressures. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.","Androstenedione; Coloniality; Dichromatism; Maternal effects; Testosterone; Yolk androgens","adaptation; androgen; bird; colonial organism; comparative study; interspecific variation; maternal effect; phenotype; sexual selection; testosterone; Aves; androstenedione; testosterone; animal; animal embryo; article; bird; chemistry; egg yolk; embryo development; female; male; phenotype; phylogeny; sexual development; social behavior; Androstenedione; Animals; Birds; Egg Yolk; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Female; Male; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Sex Characteristics; Social Behavior; Testosterone"

Knowledge accumulated concerning the molecular mechanisms of apoptotic cell death has aided the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat cancer. Signals through death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily have been well elucidated, and death receptors are now one of the most attractive therapeutic targets in cancer. In particular, DR5 and DR4, death receptors of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL or Apo2L), are interesting targets of antibody-based therapy, since TRAIL may also bind decoy receptors that may prevent TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, whereas TRAIL ligand itself selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Here, we review the potential therapeutic utility of agonistic antibodies against DR5 and DR4 and discuss the possible extension of this single-antibody-based strategy when combined with additional modalities that either synergizes to cause enhanced apoptosis or further engage the cellular immune response. Rational design of antibody-based therapies combining the induction of tumor cell apoptosis and activation of tumor-specific adaptive immunity enables promotion of distinct steps of the antitumor immune response, thereby enhancing tumor-specific lymphocytes that can eradicate TRAIL/DR5-resistant mutating, large established and heterogeneous tumors in a manner that does not require the definition of individual tumor-specific antigens. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.","Anti-tumor immune response; Apoptosis; DR4; DR5; TNF superfamily; TRAIL","antineoplastic agent; bortezomib; CD137 ligand monoclonal antibody; CD40 ligand monoclonal antibody; cetuximab; cytokine antibody; death receptor 4; death receptor 4 monoclonal antibody; death receptor 5; death receptor 5 monoclonal antibody; epidermal growth factor receptor 2 monoclonal antibody; interferon; md5 1; proteasome inhibitor; recombinant tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; rituximab; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; unclassified drug; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; B cell leukemia; cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cell death; cellular immunity; cross linking; drug efficacy; drug potency; drug targeting; gene mutation; human; immunomodulation; immunoreactivity; in vitro study; in vivo study; lymphocyte activation; molecular interaction; myeloablative conditioning; nonhuman; priority journal; radioimmunotherapy; review; treatment duration; tumor cell; tumor immunity; Animals; Antibodies, Neoplasm; Disease Progression; Humans; Immunotherapy; Neoplasms; Receptors, Death Domain; TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand"

However, two nonexclusive evolutionary hypotheses predict an interspecific relationship between egg testosterone levels and the elaboration of sexual traits. First, maternal investment may be particularly enhanced in sexually selected species, which should generate a positive relationship. Secondly, high prenatal testosterone levels may constrain the development of sexual characters, which should result in a negative relationship. Here we investigated these hypotheses by exploring the relationship between yolk testosterone levels and features of song in a phylogenetic study of 36 passerine species. We found that song duration and syllable repertoire size were significantly negatively related to testosterone levels in the egg, even if potentially confounding factors were held constant. These relationships imply that high testosterone levels during early development of songs may be detrimental, thus supporting the developmental constraints hypothesis. By contrast, we found significant evidence that song-post exposure relative to the height of the vegetation is positively related to egg testosterone levels. These results support the hypothesis that high levels of maternal testosterone have evolved in species with intense sexual selection acting on the location of song-posts. We found nonsignificant effects for intersong interval and song type repertoire size, which may suggest that none of the above hypothesis apply to these traits, or they act simultaneously and have opposing effects. © 2007 The Authors.","Androgens; Birds; Maternal hormones; Repertoire size; Sexual selection; Song; Yolk testosterone","testosterone; egg; evolution; interspecific variation; maternal effect; parental investment; phylogenetics; sexual selection; song; songbird; testosterone; vegetation structure; animal; article; bird; classification; evolution; female; male; metabolism; oocyte; phylogeny; physiology; sexual selection; species difference; vocalization; Animals; Birds; Evolution; Female; Male; Mating Preference, Animal; Ovum; Phylogeny; Species Specificity; Testosterone; Vocalization, Animal; Aves; Passeriformes"

Thus, factors that control NK cell numbers and function are critical for the innate immune response. A subset of NK cells express the inhibitory killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1). In this study, we identify that KLRG1 expression is acquired during periods of NK cell division such as development and homeostatic proliferation. KLRG1+ NK cells are mature in phenotype, and we show for the first time that these cells have a slower in vivo turnover rate, reduced proliferative response to IL-15, and poorer homeostatic expansion potential compared with mature NK cells lacking KLRG1. Transfer into lymphopenic recipients indicate that KLRG1+ NK cells are precursors of KLRG1+ NK cells and KLRG1 expression accumulates following cell division. Furthermore, KLRG1+ NK cells represent a significantly greater proportion of NK cells in mice with enhanced NK cell numbers such as Cd45-/- mice. These data indicate that NK cells acquire KLRG1 on their surface during development, and this expression correlates with functional distinctions from other peripheral NK cells in vivo.

We used extensive data on prey abundance and availability from two long-term studies of the European Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and the Eurasian Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) to quantify the relationship between predation risk of different prey species and infection with malaria and other protozoan blood parasites. Using a total of 31 745 prey individuals of 65 species of birds from 1709 nests during 1977-1997 for the Sparrowhawk and a total of 21 818 prey individuals of 76 species of birds from 1480 nests for the Goshawk during 1977-2004, we show that prey species with a high prevalence of blood parasites had higher risks of predation than species with a low prevalence. That was also the case when a number of confounding variables of prey species, such as body mass, breeding sociality, sexual dichromatism, and similarity among species in risk of predation due to common descent, were controlled in comparative analyses of standardized linear contrasts. Prevalence of the genera Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, Plasmodium, and Trypanosoma were correlated with each other, and we partitioned out the independent effects of different protozoan genera on predation risk in comparative analyses. Prevalence of Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, and Plasmodium accounted for interspecific variation in predation risk for the two raptors. These findings suggest that predation is an important factor affecting parasite-host dynamics because predators tend to prey on hosts that are more likely to be infected, thereby reducing the transmission success of parasites. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that protozoan infections are a common cause of death for hosts mediated by increased risk of predation. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Accipiter gentilis; Accipiter nisus; Goshawk; Haemoproteus; Host-parasite interactions; Leucocytozoon; Plasmodium; Prey selection; Sparrowhawk; Trypanosoma","comparative study; hemoparasite; host-parasite interaction; interspecific variation; malaria; parasite prevalence; parasite transmission; predation; predation risk; prey availability; prey selection; protozoan; raptor; animal; animal disease; animal parasitosis; article; Coccidia; female; hawk; host parasite interaction; isolation and purification; malaria; male; parasitemia; physiology; Plasmodium; population density; population dynamics; predation; prediction and forecasting; risk factor; Trypanosoma; Animals; Female; Haemosporida; Hawks; Host-Parasite Relations; Malaria; Male; Parasitemia; Plasmodium; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Predatory Behavior; Predictive Value of Tests; Protozoan Infections, Animal; Risk Factors; Trypanosoma; Accipiter gentilis; Accipiter nisus; Aves; Haemoproteus; Leucocytozoon; Protozoa; Raptores; Trypanosoma"

I investigated patterns of actuarial senescence in a sample of 169 species of birds in relation to latitude and migration, by analysing longevity records adjusted for sampling effort, survival rate and body mass. Senescence might decrease at low latitudes because of elevated adult survival rates and generally slow life histories. Alternatively, the rate of senescence might increase at low latitudes because of the greater impact of biological interactions such as parasitism, predation and competition on fitness through differential effects of age-specific mortality (e.g. because immunologically naïve young individuals and immuno-senescent old individuals might die more frequently than individuals belonging to intermediate age classes). Bird migration entails extensive exercise twice annually, with migrants spending more time in benign environments with little abiotic mortality than residents, migrants having higher adult survival rate and lower annual fecundity than residents, and migrants suffering more from the consequences of oxidative stress than residents. The rate of senescence increased with latitude, as expected because of slow life histories at low latitudes. Independently, rate of senescence decreased with increasing migration distance. These findings were robust to control for potentially confounding effects of body mass, age of first reproduction and phenotypic similarity among species because of common descent. © 2007 The Author Journal Compilation 2007 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.","Actuarial senescence; Anti-oxidants; Bird banding; Evolutionary theories of senescence; Longevity","antioxidant; bird; body mass; fecundity; fitness; latitude; life history theory; life history trait; longevity; migration; mortality; phenotype; senescence; survival; aging; animal; article; bird; classification; comparative study; geography; longevity; phylogeny; physiology; population migration; species difference; Aging; Animal Migration; Animals; Birds; Geography; Longevity; Phylogeny; Species Specificity; Aves"

Carotenoids have been hypothesized to mediate costs of reproduction in females as well as maternal effects. However, assessing potential transgenerational and population consequences of environmental availability of carotenoids requires a better understanding of mechanisms of maternal effects mediated by these antioxidant pigments. Manipulating dietary availability of carotenoids to egg-laying female blue tits and subsequently cross-fostering nestlings between female treatments allowed us to specifically investigate the relative importance of maternal effects through egg carotenoids and through post-hatching care mediated by antioxidants in females. Nestling body size and mass and plasma antioxidants were not significantly affected by pre- or post-hatching maternal effects mediated by antioxidants, although both types of maternal effects in interaction explained the variation in growth, as measured by wing length. Development of the ability to mount a cell-mediated immune response as well as its temporal dynamics was influenced by both pre- and post-hatching maternal effects, with an advantage to nestlings originating from, or reared by, carotenoid-supplemented females. In addition, nestlings reared by carotenoid-fed females had a lower blood sedimentation rate, indicating that they may have been less infected than nestlings from controls. Finally, prehatching maternal effects in interaction with nestling plasma carotenoid levels affected the development of carotenoid-based plumage. Maternal effects mediated by carotenoids may thus act as a proximate factor in development and phenotypic plasticity in traits associated with nestling fitness, such as immune response and ability to metabolize and use antioxidants, and ultimately participate in the evolution of phenotypic traits. © 2007 The Authors.","Antioxidants; Carotenoids; Cell-mediated immune response; Cross-fostering; Fledgling condition; Maternal effects; Plumage colour","antioxidant; carotenoid; phytohemagglutinin; antioxidant; carotenoid; hatching; immune response; local adaptation; maternal effect; nestling; phenotypic plasticity; reproductive cost; songbird; animal; article; blood; cellular immunity; chemistry; comparative study; female; forelimb; France; growth, development and aging; hindlimb; histology; immunology; maternal nutrition; metabolism; morphometrics; nesting; oocyte; physiology; pigmentation; songbird; Animals; Antioxidants; Body Weights and Measures; Carotenoids; Female; France; Immunity, Cellular; Maternal Nutrition Physiology; Nesting Behavior; Ovum; Passeriformes; Phytohemagglutinins; Pigmentation; Tarsus, Animal; Wing"

Exercise resulted in a suite of physiological disturbances for largemouth bass that included a depletion of anaerobic energy stores, an accumulation of lactate, and increased cardiac output. At 1 h following exercise, exhaustively exercised largemouth bass forced to swim exhibited expedited recovery relative to fish in static water, evidenced by lower concentrations of lactate in white muscle, elevated concentrations of phosphocreatine in white muscle, and reduced concentrations of glucose in plasma. By 4 h post-exercise, largemouth bass forced to swim during recovery exhibited signs of physiological disturbance that were absent in fish recovered in static water. These signs of disturbance included a loss of osmotically active particles from plasma, elevated lactate in plasma, reductions of phospocreatine in white muscle, and increased cardiac output.

Here we showed that perforin (Prf1) and granzymes (Gzms) have distinct roles in defensive immunity and immunopathology in a well-established model of viral infection. Both Prf1 and Gzms drastically affected the outcome of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. Viral titres increased markedly in both Prf1-/- and Gzma-/-Gzmb-/- mice, but Gzma-/-Gzmb-/- mice recovered and survived infection, whereas Prf1-/- mice did not. Indeed, infected Prf1-deficient hosts developed a fatal hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)-like syndrome. This distinction in outcome depended on accumulation of mononuclear cells and T cells in infected Prf1-/- mice. Importantly, blocking experiments that clearly identified tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) as the principal contributor to the lethality observed in infected Prf1-/- mice provided support for the clinical potential of such an approach in HLH patients whose disease is triggered by viral infection. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We examined a time course of this male induction with histological and marker gene expression analyses. Oogenesis started in the gonads of the control embryo at hatching; spermatogenesis did not start until two months after hatching. In the MT-treated fish, oogenesis started initially as in the control but stopped completely within one month after hatching. Instead, spermatogonial proliferation started earlier than in the control fish and progressed to full spermatogenesis. Expression profiles of the sex-specific marker genes corresponded well with histological observations.

Heterogeneity in isotope profiles will reflect heterogeneity in molt locations, but also heterogeneity in breeding locations, because spatial heterogeneity in molt locations will be congruent with spatial heterogeneity in breeding locations in species with high connectivity between breeding and molting sites. We used information on the congruence of spatial heterogeneity in molt and breeding location to study population processes in Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica) from a region near Chernobyl, Ukraine, that has been radioactively contaminated since 1986; from an uncontaminated control region near Kanev, Ukraine; and from a sample of pre-1986 museum specimens used to investigate patterns prior to the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, from both regions. Previous studies have revealed severe reductions in Barn Swallow reproductive performance and adult survival in the Chernobyl region, implying that the population is a sink and unable to sustain itself. Female Barn Swallows are known to disperse farther from their natal site than males, implying that female stable-isotope profiles should tend to be more variable than profiles of males. However, if the Barn Swallows breeding at Chernobyl are not self-sustaining, we would expect males there also to originate from a larger area than males from the control region. We found evidence that the sample of adult Barn Swallows from the Chernobyl region was more isotopically heterogeneous than the control sample, as evidenced from a significant correlation between feather δ13C and δ15N values in the control region, but not in the Chernobyl region. Furthermore, we found a significant difference in feather δ15N values between regions and periods (before and after 1986). When we compared the variances in δ13C values of feathers, we found that variances in both sexes from post-1986 samples from Chernobyl were significantly larger than variances for feather samples from the control region, and than variances for historical samples from both regions. These findings suggest that stable-isotope measurements can provide information about population processes following environmental perturbations. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Barn Swallows; Chernobyl, Ukraine; Correlation of stable-isotope profiles; Hirundo rustica; Sinks; Sources; Variance in stable-isotope profiles","carbon; nitrogen; Chernobyl accident; feather; heterogeneity; passerine; reproductive behavior; reproductive success; stable isotope; aging; animal; article; chemistry; demography; feather; female; male; physiology; population migration; sexual development; swallow (bird); Ukraine; Aging; Animal Migration; Animals; Carbon Isotopes; Demography; Feathers; Female; Male; Nitrogen Isotopes; Sex Characteristics; Swallows; Ukraine; Cerkassy; Chernobyl; Eastern Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Kanev Reservoir; Kiev [Ukraine]; Ukraine; Aves; Hirundo; Hirundo rustica"

Timing of reproduction by five of the eight numerically most common prey of the sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus advanced significantly since 1971, during a period of temperature increase. There was no evidence that mean laying date or any other reproductive parameter of sparrowhawks changed consistently during the study period 1977-1997. Laying date advanced and percentage of unsuccessful female sparrowhawks decreased with beech mast in the current year, an index of food abundance for avian prey. Mean laying date of sparrowhawks was advanced in warmer springs, and although mean clutch size was not larger in warm than in cold springs, mean brood size of successful pairs and breeding success increased in such springs, showing that sparrowhawks enjoyed a fitness gain when reproducing early. The timing of sparrowhawk reproduction with respect to the peak in abundance of fledgling prey increased, from a good match between mean timing of fledging by prey and maximum demand for food by the predator in 1977, to reproduction occurring later than the peak in fledging prey availability in 1997. The size of the breeding population of sparrowhawks was not predicted by mean spring temperature, the size of the breeding population the previous year or beech mast crop. The size of the post-breeding population was predicted by size of the breeding and post-breeding population the previous year and by the proportion of unsuccessful females the current year. These findings imply that sparrowhawks did not respond to change in climate, although climate changed the timing of reproduction by the main prey species. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Beech mast; Fecundity; Laying date; Reproductive success; Variance in reproductive success","abundance; brood size; climate effect; fecundity; laying date; population density; prey availability; raptor; reproductive success; animal; article; beech; bird; climate; clutch size; fertility; food chain; growth, development and aging; hawk; periodicity; physiology; population density; time; Animals; Birds; Climate; Clutch Size; Fagus; Fertility; Food Chain; Hawks; Periodicity; Population Density; Time Factors; Accipiter nisus; Aves; Fagus"

Using a mouse renal cancer (Renca), we show that NKG2D recognition by NK cells was crucial for their ability to limit tumor metastases in vivo in both liver and lungs using perforin-dependent effector mechanisms. However, for the R331 cell line established from Renca, NKG2D recognition and perforin-dependent lysis played no role in controlling liver metastases. R331 cells were also more resistant to perforin-dependent lysis by NK cells in vitro. We therefore used these phenotypic differences between Renca and R331 to further investigate the crucial receptor:ligand interactions required for triggering lytic effector functions of NK cells. Reconstitution of R331 cells with ICAM-1, but not Rae-1γ, restored NKG2D-mediated, perforin-dependent lysis. Interestingly, R331 cells were efficiently lysed by NK cells using death ligand-mediated apoptosis. This death ligand-mediated killing did not depend on NKG2D recognition of its ligands on tumor cells. This result suggests that the intracellular signaling in NK cells required for perform and death ligand-mediated lysis of tumor target cell are quite distinct, and activation of both of these antitumor lytic effector functions of NK cells could improve therapeutic benefits for certain tumors.

R. marmoratus AR, ERα, and ERβ genes showed a high similarity to the relevant fish species on amino acid residues, respectively. Rm-ERα and Rm-ERβ cDNAs included a serine-rich region when compared to other teleost fish ER genes. Tissue-specific expression of Rm-AR and Rm-ERβ mRNAs in adult hermaphrodite R. marmoratus was high in the gonad, while Rm-ERα mRNA was high in the liver based on real-time RT-PCR. In addition, Rm-AR and Rm-ERα mRNAs increased along with developmental stage from stage 3 (5 dpf) to hatching, while Rm-ERβ mRNA increased from stage 2 (2 dpf). To uncover the effect of estrogenic chemicals on R. marmoratus, we exposed the fish to NP (300 μg/l) and BisA (600 μg/l) for 96 h. Significant down-regulation of Rm-AR, Rm-ERα, and Rm-ERβ mRNA was observed in gonadal tissue after exposure to NP but not BisA. In the liver, there were gender differences in gene expression after EDC exposure.

The brain aromatase (rm-cyp19b) cDNA consisted of 2,124 bp including the open reading frame (ORF), which encoded a putative protein of 505 amino acids. The ovarian aromatase (rm-cyp19a) cDNA consisted of 2,075 bp, including the ORF encoding a putative protein of 516 amino acids. Expression patterns of rm-cyp19b and rm-cyp19a mRNAs were investigated in embryos of different developmental stages and in seven different tissues of adult fish. The rm-cyp19b gene in hermaphrodite and secondary male R. marmoratus was predominantly expressed in the brain, while the rm-cyp19a gene was expressed gender-specifically in the gonad. The expression of rm-cyp19b mRNA increased from stage 1 (2d post fertilization) to stage 4 (12d post fertilization) in a developmental stage-dependent manner but steeply decreased in the hatching stage. Compared to the rm-cyp19b gene, the abundance of ovarian aromatase rm-cyp19a transcripts was very low, and its expression was first detected at stage 3 and then decreased gradually to the hatching stage.

In the Rm Ki-ras gene, the long form was expressed strongly in the gonad and intestine, and the short form was expressed ubiquitously, except for a low level of expression in the liver. Following 4-NP exposure (300 μg/L), the Rm Ki-ras long form in the liver was significantly expressed, while it was expressed moderately in the ovaries. However, the Rm Ha-ras gene was significantly over-expressed in the brain, while its expression in the gonad was down-regulated. In relation to these modulations after 4-NP exposure, we searched the Rm Ha- and Ki-ras promoter regions and found several ERE-half sites, that may be involved in the modulation of ras gene expression following 4-NP exposure. These genes could be applicable as new biomarker genes for assessing exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Further, this implies the disturbance of ras-dependent signal transduction following EDC exposure. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We used a combination of underwater videography, radio telemetry and direct observation to examine how the cost of parental care varied with both its duration and intensity. Duration of parental care, activity patterns, and energetic costs varied widely among species. Overall, the duration of care increased with parental size between species. When energetic costs were adjusted for species-specific differences in the duration of parental care, the cost of parental care also increased with mean size of the species. Species with extended parental care exhibited stage-specific patterns of activity and energy expenditure consistent with parental investment theory, whereas fish with short duration parental care tended to maintain high levels of activity throughout the entire period of parental care. The only apparent exception (a species with brief parental care but stage-specific behavior) was a species with multiple breeding bouts, and thus effectively having protracted parental care. These data suggest that some species with short duration parental care can afford not to adjust parental investment over stages of offspring development. Using our empirical data on parental care duration and costs, we reevaluated the relationship between egg size and quality of parental care. Variation in egg size explained almost all of the observed variation in total energetic cost of parental care, and to a lesser degree, duration-the larger the eggs, the more costly the parental care. This research highlights the value of incorporating energetic information into the study of parental care behavior and testing of ecological theory. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Activity patterns; Centrarchid fish; Egg size; Energetic costs; Parental care","bioenergetics; fish; parental care; animal; animal behavior; article; body size; comparative study; cytology; energy metabolism; female; growth, development and aging; histology; life cycle; male; oocyte; Perciformes; physiology; reproduction; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Size; Energy Metabolism; Female; Life Cycle Stages; Male; Ovum; Perciformes; Reproduction; Centrarchidae; Pisces"

In addition, highly social species that live in sites that are protected from extrinsic mortality due to predation should senesce at a slower rate than solitary species. Therefore, species that start reproducing late in life should senesce at a slower rate than species that start reproducing early. In addition, social species should senesce more slowly than solitary species. Here I investigate the rate of senescence using an extensive data set on longevity records under natural field conditions to test predictions about the evolution of senescence among 271 species of birds. Longevity records increased with sampling effort and body mass, but once these confounding variables were controlled statistically, there was a strongly positive relationship between relative longevity and relative adult survival rate. Relative longevity after controlling statistically for sampling effort, body mass and adult survival rate, increased with age at first reproduction, but not with degree of breeding sociality. These findings suggest that the evolution of senescence is related to timing of first reproduction, but that the evolution of breeding sociality has played a negligible role in the evolution of senescence. © 2006 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.","Age at first reproduction; Ageing; Coloniality; Longevity; Sampling effort; Survival","breeding; evolution; mutation; predation; survival; viability; aging; animal; article; bird; cultural anthropology; evolution; female; histology; male; physiology; reproduction; social behavior; Aging; Animals; Birds; Cultural Evolution; Evolution; Female; Male; Reproduction; Social Behavior; Aves"

In this study we have determined that mature NK1.1+ NKT cells are retained by the thymus to form an extremely long-lived resident population capable of rapid and prolonged production of IFN-γ and IL-4. The retention of mature NKT cells provides an explanation for why the periphery is mainly seeded by immature NK1.1 - cells despite mature NK1.1+ NKT cells being more abundant in the thymus.

However, few studies have investigated patterns of phenotypic selection across large spatial scales. We quantified the intensity of selection on morphology in a monogamous passerine bird, the barn swallow Hirundo rustica, using 6495 adults from 22 populations distributed across Europe and North Africa. According to the classical Darwin-Fisher mechanism of sexual selection in monogamous species, two important components of fitness due to sexual selection are the advantages that the most attractive males acquire by starting to breed early and their high annual fecundity. We estimated directional selection differentials on tail length (a secondary sexual character) and directional selection gradients after controlling for correlated selection on wing length and tarsus length with respect to these two fitness components. Phenotype and fitness components differed significantly among populations for which estimates were available for more than a single year. Likewise, selection differentials and selection gradients differed significantly among populations for tail length, but not for the other two characters. Sexual selection differentials differed significantly from zero across populations for tail length, particularly in males. Controlling statistically for the effects of age reduced the intensity of selection by 60 to 81%, although corrected and uncorrected estimates were strongly positively correlated. Selection differentials and gradients for tail length were positively correlated between the sexes among populations for selection acting on breeding date, but not for fecundity selection. The intensity of selection with respect to breeding date and fecundity were significantly correlated for tail length across populations. Sexual size dimorphism in tail length was significantly correlated with selection differentials with respect to breeding date for tail length in male barn swallows across populations. These findings suggest that patterns of sexual selection are consistent across large geographical scales, but also that they vary among populations. In addition, geographical patterns of phenotypic selection predict current patterns of phenotypic variation among populations, suggesting that consistent patterns of selection have been present for considerable amounts of time. © 2006 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

We have determined the structures of two human NKT TCRs that differ in their CDR3β composition and length. Both TCRs contain a conserved, positively charged pocket at the ligand interface that is lined by residues from the invariant TCR α- and semi-invariant β-chains. The cavity is centrally located and ideally suited to interact with the exposed glycosyl head group of glycolipid antigens. Sequences common to mouse and human invariant NKT TCRs reveal a contiguous conserved ""hot spot"" that provides a basis for the reactivity of NKT cells across species. Structural and functional data suggest that the CDR3β loop provides a plasticity mechanism that accommodates recognition of a variety of glycolipid antigens presented by CD1d.

Thus parental ability to provide nestlings with a carotenoid-rich diet may enhance offspring fitness. However, very little is known about the possible effects of carotenoid availability in the diet on growing nestlings in natural populations. We experimentally manipulated dietary intake of carotenoids by nestlings of two closely related passerine species, the great tit Parus major and the blue tit Parus caeruleus, and measured nestling antioxidants, body condition, immunity and plumage colour. There was no detectable increase in plasma carotenoids after treatment in carotenoid-fed nestlings of either species despite regular supply of dietary carotenoids. However, in carotenoid-fed blue tit nestlings, plasma vitamin E concentration increased with plasma carotenoid concentration, while that was not the case for control nestlings. In both species, there was no significant effect of carotenoid supply on immune function. Carotenoid supplementation enhanced yellow feather colour in great tit nestlings only. In both species a strong effect of carotenoid supply was found on body condition with an increase in body mass for small carotenoid-fed nestlings compared to similarly sized control nestlings. Dietary availability of carotenoids may thus have important fitness consequences for tits. We hypothesise that the difference in effect of dietary carotenoids on the two species is due to relatively larger clutch size and higher growth rates of blue tits compared to great tits, leading to blue tit nestlings being more in need of carotenoids for antioxidant function than great tit nestlings.","Antioxidants; Early development; Feather colour; Fledgling body mass; Immune function","antioxidant; carotenoid; animal; animal embryo; animal food; article; blood; diet; feather; France; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; phenotype; physiology; prenatal development; songbird; thorax; Animal Feed; Animals; Antioxidants; Carotenoids; Diet; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Feathers; France; Phenotype; Songbirds; Thorax; Aves; Parus caeruleus; Parus major; Passeriformes"

Although coevolutionary models assume that defences and counter-defences are genetically influenced, this has never been demonstrated for brood parasites. Here, we give strong evidence for genetic differences between ejector and nonejectors, which could allow the study of such host defence at the genetic level, as well as studies of maintenance of genetic variation in defences. Briefly, we found that magpies, that are the main host of the great spotted cuckoo in Europe, have alleles of one microsatellite locus (Ase64) that segregate between accepters and rejecters of experimental parasitic eggs.

Here, we examined the role of crossing distance on the cardiovascular response to exhaustive exercise among differentiated stocks of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides at 10°C and 20°C. Stocks of 2+ fish were produced using adults from three regions in the midwestern United States (southeastern Wisconsin, northwestern Wisconsin, and west central Minnesota) and were crossed with fish from central Illinois. Doppler flow probes were used to quantify cardiac output, heart rate, and stroke volume. Cardiac variables (both resting and maximal) were consistently lowest in pure Illinois fish relative to the F1 interstock hybrids. Additionally, when exposed to exercise, cardiac variables for F1 interstock hybrids required ∼40% longer to return to resting levels compared with the pure Illinois stock. However, the time required to exhaust fish was similar across stocks. Interestingly, all of the stocks (including the interstock hybrids and pure Illinois) maintained cardiac scope. In general, the patterns observed in cardiovascular performance were consistent for both water temperatures. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine which of the divergence metrics contributed to variation in cardiovascular performance in interstock hybrids. Mitochondrial DNA data (genetic distance) were infrequently identified as a significant source of variation in cardiovascular performance. However, genetic distance data for the neutral allozyme markers revealed that these stocks have experienced significant divergence. Latitude (geographic distance) accounted for between 31% and 45% of variation observed in the recovery parameters. This study suggests that the magnitude of stock divergence is an important determinant in the degree to which cardiovascular performance of bass is altered from interstock hybridization and associated breakdown of coadapted gene complexes. Furthermore, these data suggest that translocating bass among even geographically discrete regions or among stocks with reasonable genetic similarity can result in substantial performance alterations at the F1 generation. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

In contrast to NK cells, T cells fail to express the activation-signaling molecule DAP12 even when activated and, therefore, ligation of NKG2D alone is insufficient to induce T cell cytolytic function. To test whether we could endow T cells with NK cell-like effector function, we have engineered DAP12 into T cells by retroviral transduction (T-DAP12). T-DAP12 cells were demonstrated to specifically secrete interferon-γ following receptor ligation and to mediate potent and specific lysis of the NKG2D ligand (NKG2D-L) (Rae-1β) expressing MHC class I-deficient and class I-sufficient tumors. To circumvent the inability of T-DAP12 cells to proliferate following NKG2D ligation by Rae-1β expressing tumors, DAP12 was engineered into OT-1 cells with an endogenous T cell receptor specific for chicken ovalbumin peptide (amino acids 257-264). Importantly, following a period of proliferation through endogenous T cell receptor ligation, OT-1-DAP12 cells retained specificity against NKG2D-L expressing major histocompatibility complex class I-deficient tumor. In adoptive transfer experiments, T-DAP12 cells enhanced the survival of NK cell-depleted RAG-1-deficient mice inoculated with RMA-S-Rae-1β but not parental RMA-S tumors. Overall, this study demonstrated the significant potential of suppressing tumors and other cellular targets expressing NKG2D-L by endowing T cells with innate NK cell-like function. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Cells; Histology; Signaling; Tumors; Activation-signaling molecule; Cell cytolytic function; Histocompatibility; Receptor; Genetic engineering; amino acid; killer cell activating receptor associated protein; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; natural killer cell receptor NKG2D; retinoic acid; cytokine; epitope; gamma interferon; immunoglobulin receptor; ligand; natural killer cell activating receptors; ovalbumin; peptide; signal transducing adaptor protein; Tyrobp protein, mouse; animal cell; animal experiment; article; cell proliferation; cell survival; genetic engineering; mouse; natural killer T cell; nonhuman; priority journal; T lymphocyte activation; animal; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell line; chemistry; chicken; cytology; flow cytometry; genetics; immunology; immunotherapy; major histocompatibility complex; metabolism; methodology; molecular cloning; natural killer cell; neoplasm; physiology; polymerase chain reaction; Retrovirus; T lymphocyte; time; transgenic mouse; tumor cell line; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Animals; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Chickens; Cloning, Molecular; Cytokines; Epitopes; Flow Cytometry; Genetic Engineering; Immunotherapy; Interferon Type II; Killer Cells, Natural; Ligands; Major Histocompatibility Complex; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Neoplasms; Ovalbumin; Peptides; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Receptors, Immunologic; Retroviridae; T-Lymphocytes; Time Factors"

P. Moller, F. de Lope and N. Saino: Reproduction and migration in relation to senescence in the barn swallow Hirundo rustica: A study of avian 'centenarians'. Senescence reflects the decrease in age-dependent residual reproductive value, and a previous study of a cohort of migratory barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) that had reached advanced ages for this species (at least five years old) provided evidence consistent with senescence such as reduced reproductive performance and increased abundance of parasites. We studied a population of migratory barn swallows over a number of years. Several questions were asked including 1) how do longer lived birds compare to shorter lived individuals of the same species, 2) is there a difference in individuals of the same species that live in different geographical regions, and 3) how do patterns of reproduction change during aging? We compared the phenotypes of 87 individuals from three populations in Denmark, Italy and Spain that had reached at least five years old with those of control individuals matched for sex, arrival date and breeding site. These controls only became one year old, i.e., they were not found thereafter and both groups of individuals were compared in their first year of life. Results showed that there were no significant differences in any of 11 morphological characters or in the abundance of three ectoparasites between the two groups of birds. Females that eventually became very old had relatively smaller first clutches as one year olds than did one year old controls, while males that eventually became very old had mates that laid clutches that were relatively larger than those of controls. Annual fecundity showed a similar pattern, with an increased sex difference in fecundity between birds from Spain than in Italy and in Denmark. Danish barn swallows that achieved older ages had relatively lower haematocrits than control individuals of the same sex, age and arrival date captured at the same site, while the difference in haematocrits between these two categories of individuals was small for Italian birds. Spring arrival date was relatively earlier in Danish males that eventually became very old compared to control males of the same age and tail length (a correlate of fitness) that arrived at the same site, while the two age categories of females did not differ in arrival date. In the Spanish population there was no difference in arrival date between the birds that aged most successfully and controls for either sex. We will discuss these findings in relation to current senescence theories. © Springer 2006.","Arrival date; Fecundity; Maternal effects; Mechanisms of senescence; Senescence","article; barn swallow; bird; breeding method; controlled study; Denmark; ectoparasite; evidence based medicine; fertility; fitness; gender; hematocrit; Hirundo rustica; Italy; migration; nonhuman; phenotype; population migration; reproduction; senescence; Spain; species difference; statistical significance; theoretical model"

Liver-derived NKT cells were used in these studies because of their relative abundance in this organ, and it was assumed that they were representative of NKT cells from other sites. We compared NKT cells from liver, thymus, and spleen for their ability to mediate rejection of the sarcoma cell line (MCA-1) in vivo, and found that this was a specialized function of liver-derived NKT cells. Furthermore, when CD4+ and CD4- liver-derived NKT cells were administered separately, MCA-1 rejection was mediated primarily by the CD4- fraction. Very similar results were achieved using the B16F10 melanoma metastasis model, which requires NKT cell stimulation with α-galactosylceramide. The impaired ability of thymus-derived NKT cells was due, in part, to their production of IL-4, because tumor immunity was clearly enhanced after transfer of IL-4-deficient thymus-derived NKT cells. This is the first study to demonstrate the existence of functionally distinct NKT cell subsets in vivo and may shed light on the long-appreciated paradox that NKT cells function as immunosuppressive cells in some disease models, whereas they promote cell-mediated immunity in others.

We report that the G-CSF and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt-SL) chimeric cytokine, progenipoietin-1, markedly expands the splenic and hepatic NKT cell population and enhances functional responses to α-galactosylcerainide. In a murine model of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, donor NKT cells promoted host DC activation and enhanced perforin-restricted CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity against host-type antigens. Following leukemic challenge, donor treatment with progenipoietin-1 significantly improved overall survival when compared with G-CSF or control, attributable to reduced graft-versus-host disease mortality and paradoxical augmentation of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. Enhanced cellular cytotoxicity was dependent on donor NKT cells, and leukemia clearance was profoundly impaired in recipients of NKT cell-deficient grafts. Enhanced cytotoxicity and GVL effects were not associated with Flt-3L signaling or effects on DCs but were reproduced by prolonged G-CSF receptor engagement with pegylated G-CSF. Thus, modified G-CSF signaling during stem cell mobilization augments NKT cell-dependent CD8+ cytotoxicity, effectively separating graft-versus-host disease and GVL and greatly expanding the potential applicability of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for the therapy of malignant disease.",,"alpha galactosylceramide; CD8 antigen; chimeric protein; Flt3 ligand; granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor; pegylated granulocyte colony stimulating factor; perforin; progenipoietin 1; recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor; unclassified drug; allogeneic stem cell transplantation; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; cell survival; chimera; controlled study; cytokine production; cytotoxicity; drug potency; female; graft versus leukemia effect; immunoregulation; leukemia; leukemia cell; malignant transformation; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; priority journal; reproducibility; signal transduction; stem cell mobilization; Animals; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Colony-Stimulating Factors; Dendritic Cells; Female; Galactosylceramides; Graft vs Leukemia Effect; Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization; Killer Cells, Natural; Leukemia, Experimental; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Recombinant Proteins; Signal Transduction; Stem Cell Transplantation; T-Lymphocytes"

In vertebrates, a major mechanism of physiological response to stress is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and results in increased secretion of glucocorticosteroids, which can have adverse consequences on diverse phenotypic traits affecting fitness. Maternal stress may thus have carry-over effects on progeny if it influences pre-natal offspring environment in terms of glucocorticosteroid concentration, although this hypothesis has never been tested in any species under field conditions. We manipulated stress experienced by female barn swallows Hirundo rustica, by exposing them to a predator during laying and measured egg corticosterone concentration. Stressed females laid eggs with greater corticosterone concentration than controls exposed to a herbivore. In another experiment, we injected physiological doses of corticosterone in the egg albumen and compared the phenotype of offspring originating from these eggs with their control siblings originating from either sham-inoculated or unmanipulated eggs and reared in the same nest. Eggs injected with corticosterone had lower hatchability and produced fledglings with smaller body size and slower plumage development than did control eggs. Nestling body size in our study population predicts long-term survival. Thus, maternal stress impaired offspring phenotype and viability by increasing transmission of glucocorticosteroids to the eggs. This study identifies a novel mechanism mediating early maternal effects whereby maternal stress affects offspring quality. These results are relevant to biological conservation because they disclose a mechanism that can link environmental conditions to population productivity and viability. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"corticosterone; analysis of variance; animal; animal disease; article; bird disease; comparative study; drug effect; female; growth, development and aging; Italy; metabolism; newborn; oocyte; pathophysiology; stress; swallow (bird); Analysis of Variance; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Bird Diseases; Corticosterone; Female; Italy; Ovum; Stress; Swallows; Hirundo; Hirundo rustica; Vertebrata"

Fraser River sockeye were intercepted in the ocean as far away as the Queen Charlotte Islands (∼850 km from the Fraser River) and during freshwater migration to the spawning grounds; for some populations this was a distance of over 700 km. Sockeye migrating in seawater toward the mouth of the Fraser River and upriver to spawning grounds showed a decline in gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity. As a result, gill Na%K+-ATPase activity of fish arriving at the spawning grounds was significantly lower than values obtained from fish captured before entry into freshwater. Plasma osmolality and chloride levels also showed significant decreases from seawater values during the freshwater migration to spawning areas. Movement from seawater to freshwater increased mRNA expression of a freshwater-specific Na+,K+-ATPase isoform (α1a) while having no effect on the seawater-specific isoform (α1b). In addition, gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity generally increased in active spawners compared with unspawned fish on the spawning grounds and this was associated with a marked increase in Na+,K+-ATPase α1b mRNA. Increases in gill Na+,K+-ATPase activities observed in spawners suggests that the fish may be attempting to compensate for the osmotic perturbation associated with the decline in plasma chloride concentration and osmolality.","Ionoregulation; Migration; Oncorhynchus nerka; Salinity; Sockeye salmon; Spawning","adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); chloride; isoenzyme; analysis of variance; animal; article; blood; Canada; comparative study; gene expression regulation; gill; metabolism; osmolarity; Pacific Ocean; physiology; population migration; river; salmon; Analysis of Variance; Animal Migration; Animals; British Columbia; Chlorides; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gills; Isoenzymes; Na(+)-K(+)-Exchanging ATPase; Osmolar Concentration; Pacific Ocean; Rivers; Salmon; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus nerka"

Traditionally, these cells were defined as NK1.1+ T cells, although only a few mouse strains express the NK1.1 molecule. A popular alternative marker for NKT cells has been DX5, an Ab that detects the CD49b integrin, expressed by most NK cells and a subset of T cells that resemble NKT cells. Interpretation of studies using DX5 as an NKT cell marker depends on how well DX5 defines NKT cells. Using a range of DX5 and other anti-CD49b Abs, we reveal major differences in reactivity depending on which Ab and which fluorochrome are used. The brightest, PE-conjugated reagents revealed that while most CD1d-dependent NKT cells expressed CD49b, they represented only a minority of CD49b+ T cells. Furthermore, CB49b+ T cell numbers were near normal in CD1d -/- mice that are completely deficient for NKT cells. CD1d tetramer- CD49b+ T cells differ from NKT cells by their activation and memory marker expression, tissue distribution, and CD4/CD8 coreceptor profile. Interestingly, both NKT cells and CD1d tetramer- CD49b+ T cells produce cytokines, but the latter are clearly biased toward Th1-type cytokines, in contrast to NKT cells that produce both Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of CD49b by NKT cells does not dramatically alter with age, contrasting with earlier reports proposing DX5 as a maturation marker for NKT cells. In summary, our data demonstrate that DX5/CD49b is a poor marker for identifying CD1d-dependent NKT cells.

Although a number of Grzs, including GrzM, have been shown to mediate target cell apoptosis in the presence of perforin, the biological activity of Grz has been restricted to control of a number of viral pathogens, including two natural mouse pathogens, ectromelia, and murine CMV (MCMV). In this article, we describe the first reported gene targeting of GrzM in mice. GrzM-deficient mice display normal NK cell/T cell development and homeostasis and intact NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity of tumor targets as measured by membrane damage and DNA fragmentation. GrzM-deficient mice demonstrated increased susceptibility to MCMV infection typified by the presence of more viral inclusions and transiently higher viral burden in the visceral organs of GrzM-deficient mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. The cytotoxicity of NK cells from MCMV-infected GrzM-deficient mice remained unchanged and, like WT control mice, GrzM-deficient mice eventually effectively cleared MCMV infection from the visceral organs. In contrast, GrzM-deficient mice were as resistant as WT control mice to mouse pox ectromelia infection, as well as challenge with a number of NK cell-sensitive tumors. These data confirm a role for GrzM in the host response to MCMV infection, but suggest that GrzM is not critical for NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

However, it remains unclear how they respond to stimulation in vivo, which costimulatory pathways are important, and what factors (e.g., Ag availability and activation-induced cell death) limit their response. We have explored these questions in the context of an in vivo model of NKT cell dynamics spanning activation, population expansion, and subsequent contraction. Neither the B7/CD28 nor the CD40/CD40L costimulatory pathway was necessary for cytokine production by activated NKT cells, either early (2 h) or late (3 days) after initial stimulation, but both pathways were necessary for normal proliferative expansion of NKT cells in vivo. The proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim was necessary for normal contraction of the NKT cell population between days 3-9 after stimulation, suggesting that the pool size is regulated by apoptotic death, similar to that of conventional T cells. Ag availability was not the limiting factor for NKT cell expansion in vivo, and a second α-GalCer injection induced a very blunted response, whereby cytokine production was reduced and further expansion did not occur. This appeared to be a form of anergy that was intrinsic to NKT cells and was not associated with inhibitory NK receptor signaling. Furthermore, NKT cells from mice prechallenged with α-GalCer in vivo showed little cytokine production and reduced proliferation in vitro. In summary, this study significantly enhances our understanding of how NKT cells respond to primary and secondary antigenic challenge in vivo.

Mice treated with IL-21 reject tumor cells more efficiently, and a higher percentage of mice remain tumor-free compared with untreated controls. In this study, we demonstrate that in certain tumor models IL-21-enhanced tumor rejection is NKG2D dependent. When engagement of the NKG2D receptor was prevented, either due to the lack of ligand expression on the tumor cells or due to direct blocking with anti-NKG2D mAb treatment, the protective effects of IL-21 treatment were abrogated or substantially diminished. Specifically, IL-21 only demonstrated a therapeutic effect in mice challenged with a retinoic acid early inducible-1δ-bearing lymphoma but not in mice bearing parental RMA tumors lacking NKG2D ligands. Furthermore, treatment with a blocking anti-NKG2D mAb largely prevented the therapeutic effect of IL-21 in mice challenged with the 4T1 breast carcinoma, the 3LL lung carcinoma, and RM-1 prostate carcinoma. By contrast, IL-21 did mediate beneficial effects against both the parental DA3 mammary carcinoma and DA3 tumors transfected with H60, a NKG2D ligand. We also observed that IL-21 treatment could enhance RMA-retinoic acid early inducible-1δ tumor rejection in RAG-1 -/- deficient mice, thereby demonstrating that the IL-21-induced protective effect can be mediated by the innate immune system and that, in this case, IL-21 does not require the adaptive immune response. Collectively, these findings suggest that IL-21 therapy may work optimally against tumors that can elicit a NKG2D-mediated immune response.

We experimentally investigated the effects of carotenoid availability in the diet during egg laying on antioxidant deposition in egg yolk and the related effects on nestling condition, female body condition and parental investment in the blue tit (Parus caeruleus). Carotenoid supplementation of egg-laying females resulted in a significant increase in carotenoid concentration in egg yolk, but not in vitamin E or A concentration. There was no relationship between yellow plumage colour of adult females and carotenoid deposition in eggs, and no differential effect of feeding treatment depending on female colour. Nestlings from eggs laid by carotenoid supplemented females had longer tarsi, had faster development of the immune system as reflected by leukocyte concentration in blood, and grew brighter yellow feathers than nestlings from control females. However, nestlings from the two groups did not differ significantly in body mass, plasma antioxidants or plumage colour hue. At the time of chick rearing, carotenoid-fed females had increased plasma vitamin E levels compared to controls. However, females from the two treatment groups did not differ significantly in body condition or feeding rate. These results suggest that carotenoid availability is limiting during egg laying, and that females may have to balance the benefits of investing in egg quality against the potential costs of impairing their own future antioxidant protection. In addition, there may be considerable variation in carotenoid availability not only across seasons, but also among different stages of the breeding season. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Antioxidants; Carotenoid-based plumage colour; Fledgling condition; Parental investment; Yolk composition","alpha tocopherol; antioxidant; carotenoid; carotenoid; animal; article; body constitution; comparative study; diet; drug effect; egg yolk; feather; female; France; leukocyte count; metabolism; morphometrics; nesting; physiology; pigmentation; reproduction; songbird; Animals; Antioxidants; Body Constitution; Body Weights and Measures; Carotenoids; Diet; Egg Yolk; Feathers; Female; France; Leukocyte Count; Nesting Behavior; Passeriformes; Pigmentation; Reproduction; Vitamin E; Animalia; Parus caeruleus"

Here we report a rational approach to improving the antitumor activity of α-GalCer by using delayed interleukin (IL)-21 treatment to mature the α-GalCer-expanded pool of NK cells into highly cytotoxic effector cells. In a series of experimental and spontaneous metastases models in mice, we demonstrate far superior antitumor activity of the α-GalCer/IL-21 combination above either agent alone. Superior antitumor activity was critically dependent upon the increased perforin-mediated cytolytic activity of NK cells. Transfer of α-GalCer-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) followed by systemic IL-21 caused an even more significant reduction in established (day 8) metastatic burden and prolonged survival. In addition, this combination prevented chemical carcinogenesis more effectively. Combinations of IL-21 with other NK cell-activating cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-12, were much less effective in the same experimental metastases models, and these cytokines did not substitute effectively for IL-21 in combination with α-GalCer. Overall, the data suggest that NK cell antitumor function can be enhanced greatly by strategies that are designed to expand and differentiate NK cells via DC activation of NKT cells.

In addition, the impact that interstock hybridization had on adaptive differences was assessed using F1 hybrids. To accomplish these assessments, four genetically distinct stocks of fish were produced using adults from two regions in the midwestern United States identified as distinct conservation management units (central Illinois. IL and southeastern Wisconsin, WI): both P1 stocks and both reciprocal F1 interstock hybrids. Cardiac variables (both resting and maximal) were consistently lowest for the ILxIL stock relative to the WIxWI stock and both F1 interstock hybrids. Interestingly, however, all groups of fish were able to maintain similar levels of cardiac scope. All fish responded to exercise by increasing heart rate and decreasing stroke volume, consistent with the notion that largemouth bass modulate cardiac output via frequency. After exercise, cardiac variables returned to resting levels 25-35% more rapidly for ILXIL fish relative to all other groups at 20°C. At 10°C, recovery rates for both P1 stocks were similar but more rapid than the interstock hybrids. Collectively, these results indicate that the locally adapted stock (ILxIL) exhibited cardiovascular adaptations that enabled rapid cardiovascular recovery and maintenance of low resting cardiac output and heart rate. Conversely, the translocated stock (WIxWI) and the interstock hybrids required longer for cardiovascular variables to recover after exercise and exhibited higher resting levels of cardiac output and heart rate. This study provides some of the first direct evidence of a physiological mechanism by which mixing stocks could potentially decrease fitness and illustrates the magnitude of the intraspecific diversity of cardiovascular performance.","Cardiac output; Heart rate; Largemouth bass; Local adaptation; Micropterus salmoides; Outbreeding; Translocation","adaptation; animal; article; bass; exercise; genetics; heart output; heart rate; hybridization; physiology; temperature; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Bass; Cardiac Output; Exertion; Heart Rate; Hybridization, Genetic; Temperature; Micropterus salmoides"

We investigated interspecific patterns of circulating testosterone in male birds to test the hypothesis that testosterone plays a crucial role in sexual selection as determined by degree of polygyny and extra-pair paternity. We predicted that the evolution of increased levels of polygyny and extra-pair paternity would have resulted in the evolution of increased levels of testosterone to allow males more efficiently to compete for mates. This hypothesis was tested in comparative analyses of 116 species of birds using Generalized Least Squares Models. We assessed the importance of latitudinal distribution, because this can confound the relationship between testosterone and mating success. There were weak positive phylogenetic correlations between measures of testosterone and estimates of mating success at the social level, but this association appeared to be confounded by latitudinal distribution, a significant correlate of testosterone titers. However, we found a significantly positive relationship between peak and residual peak testosterone (which is the peak testosterone level that is controlled for the baseline level) and extra-pair paternity independent of latitude. These results suggest that selection pressures arising from social and sexual mating differently affected testosterone levels with the former being mediated by factors associated with latitudinal distribution. An analysis of residual testes size revealed a positive association between peak and residual testosterone and testes size relative to body size. In a path analysis, we show that relative testis size primarily evolved in association with intense sperm competition and thus high sperm production, and these mechanisms had a secondary impact on blood testosterone levels at a phylogenetic scale. Our results suggest that sperm competition has played an important role in the evolution of reproductive mechanisms in birds. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Here we demonstrate that TRAIL is the dominant cytotoxic effector molecule expressed by NK cells in fetal mice. On birth and with age, NK cells develop full functional capacity, including the ability to secrete Interferon γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin 13 (IL-13) and mediate perforin- and Fas ligand-mediated cytotoxicity. However, interestingly, a phenotypically immature TRAIL + NK cell subpopulation is retained in the liver of adult mice, and its retention is dependent on IFN-γ but not dependent on host IL-12, IL-18, or endogenous host pathogens. Adoptive transfer of either adult liver or neonatal TRAIL + NK cells resulted in the appearance of TRAIL - NK cells with a mature phenotype, suggesting that these TRAIL + NK cells were indeed a precursor. Although inducers of IFN-γ stimulated TRAIL expression on mature NK cells, our data indicated that constitutive TRAIL expression was a hallmark of immature cytotoxic NK cells.

Secondary sexual characters show the potential for rapid evolutionary change, as evidenced by strong divergence among species and high evolvability. Here we show that the length of the outermost tail feathers of males of the socially monogamous barn swallow Hirundo rustica, feathers that provide a mating advantage to males, has increased by more than 1 standard deviation during the period from 1984 to 2003. Barn swallows from the Danish population studied here migrate through the Iberian Peninsula to South Africa in fall, and return along the same route in spring. Environmental conditions on the spring staging grounds in Algeria, as indexed by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, predicted tail length and change in tail length across generations. However, conditions in the winter quarters and at the breeding grounds did not predict change in tail length. Environmental conditions in Algeria in spring showed a temporal deterioration during the study period, associated with a reduction in annual survival rate of male barn swallows. Phenotypic plasticity in tail length of males, estimated as the increase in tail length from the age of 1 to 2 years, decreased during the course of the study. Estimates of directional selection differentials for male tail length with respect to mating success, breeding date, fecundity, survival and total selection showed temporal variation, with the intensity of breeding date selection, survival selection and total selection declining during the study. Response to selection as estimated from the product of heritability and total selection was very similar to the observed temporal change in tail length. These findings provide evidence of rapid micro-evolutionary change in a secondary sexual character during a very short time period, which is associated with a rapid change in environmental conditions. © 2004 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.","Barn swallow; Climate change; Condition-dependence; Evolution; Hirundo rustica; Phenotypic plasticity; Remote sensing; Survival","climate change; environmental conditions; evolution; phenotypic plasticity; secondary sexual characteristics; tail feather; Algeria; analysis of variance; animal; article; climate; comparative study; Denmark; evolution; feather; genetic selection; histology; morphometrics; sexual development; survival; swallow (bird); tail; time; Algeria; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Body Weights and Measures; Climate; Denmark; Evolution; Feathers; Selection (Genetics); Sex Characteristics; Survival Analysis; Swallows; Tail; Time Factors; Hirundo rustica"

Antioxidant levels in blood, liver and eggs were reduced in Chernobyl, Ukraine, compared with an uncontaminated control area, and levels of antioxidants correlated negatively with levels of background radiation. The frequency of abnormal sperm was almost an order of magnitude higher in Chernobyl than in the control area and was negatively related to antioxidant levels in blood and liver. This is consistent with the hypothesis of a direct link between radiation and individual levels of antioxidants, suggesting that levels of mutation differ among individuals owing to individual differences in the abundance of antioxidants. © 2005 The Royal Society.","Barn swallow; Carotenoids; Hirundo rustica; Sperm abnormality; Vitamin A; Vitamin E","alpha tocopherol; antioxidant; carotenoid; free radical; retinol; antioxidant; antioxidant; passerine; radiation exposure; reproductive disorder; sperm; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bird; Chernobyl accident; comparative study; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA repair; drug blood level; drug liver level; egg; field experiment; gene mutation; hypothesis; ionizing radiation; nonhuman; priority journal; radiation exposure; radioactive contamination; spermatozoon abnormality; animal; congenital malformation; genetics; liver; male; metabolism; mutation; oocyte; radiation response; radiometry; spermatozoon; swallow (bird); Ukraine; Chernobyl; Eastern Europe; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Kiev [Ukraine]; Ukraine; World; Hirundinidae; Hirundo rustica; Animals; Antioxidants; Liver; Male; Mutation; Ovum; Radiation Effects; Radiometry; Spermatozoa; Swallows; Ukraine"

If both regeneration options are blocked in animal models, then liver failure and death ensues. The mechanisms underlying oval cell induction, proliferation, and subsequent liver regeneration remain poorly characterized. In particular, cell-signaling pathways that distinguish the alternative pathways are unknown. This study shows that in a mouse model, hepatic expression of lymphotoxin-β (LTβ) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) transcripts is increased in response to the choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet, which induces oval cell-mediated liver regeneration. Oval cells express LTβ and IFNγ transcripts, contributing to the increased expression in the liver of mice fed the CDE diet. An attenuated oval cell response to such a diet was observed in LTβ receptor-, LTβ-, and IFNγ-gene targeted mice. Loss of LTβ and LTβ receptor signaling reduced the number of oval cells expressing A6 and muscle pyruvate kinase. The lack of IFNγ signaling reduced muscle pyruvate kinase+, but not A6+, oval cells. In contrast, partial hepatectomy suppressed LTβ and IFNγ transcripts. We also show that IFNγ induces STAT-3 phosphorylation in an oval cell line. In conclusion. LTβ, LTβ receptor, and IFNγ are involved in oval cell-mediated, but not hepatocyte-mediated, liver regeneration, and the absence of these pathways impairs the oval cell-dependent regenerative response.",,"gamma interferon; lymphotoxin beta; pyruvate kinase; STAT3 protein; animal cell; animal model; article; cell division; cell proliferation; controlled study; liver cell; liver failure; liver injury; liver regeneration; liver resection; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; stem cell; vitamin deficiency; Acute Disease; Animals; Cell Line; Choline Deficiency; Chronic Disease; Diet; DNA-Binding Proteins; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Ethionine; Hepatectomy; Interferon Type II; Liver; Liver Regeneration; Lymphotoxin-alpha; Lymphotoxin-beta; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Phosphorylation; RNA, Messenger; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Stem Cells; Trans-Activators; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Wounds and Injuries"

For example, sperm competition involves clear-cut sex differences in behaviour, as males display, mate guard and copulate with females, while females choose among males, and solicit or reject copulations. These behaviours may require fundamentally different neural government in the two sexes leading to sex-dependent brain evolution. Using two phylogenetic approaches in a comparative study, we tested for roles of both natural and sexual-selection pressures on brain size evolution of birds. In accordance with the natural-selection theory, relative brain size of males coevolved with that of females, which may be the result of adaptation to similar environmental constraints such as feeding innovation. However, the mode of brain size evolution differed between the sexes, and factors associated with sperm competition as reflected by extra-pair paternity may give rise to sexually size dimorphic brains. Specifically, species in which females have larger brains than males were found to have a higher degree of extra-pair paternity independently of potentially confounding factors, whereas species in which males have relatively larger brains than females appeared to have lower rates of extra-pair paternity. Hence, the evolution of sperm competition may select for complex behaviours together with the associated neural substrates in the sex that has a higher potential to control extra-pair copulations at the observed levels. Brain function may thus be affected differently in males and females by sexual selection. © 2005 The Royal Society.","Birds; Brain size; Extra-pair paternity; Phylogenetic correlation; Sexual dimorphism","brain; extra-pair copulation; sexual dimorphism; sexual selection; sperm competition; adaptation; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bird; brain function; brain size; copulation; evolution; feeding; female; male; natural selection; nonhuman; paternity; phylogeny; priority journal; sex difference; sexual behavior; sperm competition; theory; animal; brain; comparative study; genetic selection; histology; physiology; sexual development; species difference; spermatozoon; Animals; Birds; Brain; Evolution; Female; Male; Phylogeny; Selection (Genetics); Sex Characteristics; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Species Specificity; Spermatozoa"

Such adaptation by parasites to host defenses may occur to the detriment of the ability of parasites to exploit alternative hosts, causing parasite specialization and speciation. We investigated the relationship between level of anti-parasite defense in hosts and taxonomic richness of two chewing louse suborders (Phthiraptera: Amblycera, Ischnocera) on birds. While Amblyceran lice tend to occur in contact with host skin, feed on host skin and chew emerging tips of developing feathers to obtain blood, Ischnoceran lice live on feathers and feed on the non-living keratin of feather barbules. We hypothesized that Amblyceran abundance and richness would have evolved in response to interaction with the immune system of the host, while Ischnoceran taxonomic richness would have evolved independently of immunological constraints. In an interspecific comparison, the abundance of Ischnocerans was positively related to host body size, while host body mass and Ischnoceran taxonomic richness accounted for the abundance of Amblycerans. Amblyceran taxonomic richness was predicted by the intensity of T-cell mediated immune response of nestling hosts, while the T-cell response of adults had no significant effect. In contrast, Ischnoceran taxonomic richness was not predicted by host T-cell responses. These results suggest that the taxonomic richness of different parasite taxa is influenced by different host defenses, and they are consistent with the hypothesis that increasing host allocation to immune defense increases Amblyceran biodiversity. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Amblycera; Immunity; Ischnocera; Parasites; Species diversity","antiparasite defense; biodiversity; coevolution; host-parasite interaction; immune response; species richness; animal; article; biodiversity; bird; body size; cellular immunity; comparative study; evolution; host parasite interaction; immunology; louse; parasitology; pathogenicity; physiology; population dynamics; regression analysis; species difference; T lymphocyte; Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; Body Size; Evolution; Host-Parasite Relations; Immunity, Cellular; Lice; Population Dynamics; Regression Analysis; Species Specificity; T-Lymphocytes; Amblycera; Aves; Galliformes; Ischnocera; Phthiraptera"

The relative size of the bursa of Fabricius and the spleen in adults covaried positively with relative brain size across bird species. The relative size of these two immune defence organs covaried with sex differences in relative size of the brain, indicating that the relationship between immune defence and brain size was stronger for males.

Whereas RBL cells expressing wild-type perforin (67 kD) efficiently killed Jurkat target cells to which they were conjugated, the substitution to tryptophan at position 225 resulted in expression of a truncated (∼45 kD) form of the protein, complete loss of cytotoxicity, and failure to traffic to rat basophil leukemia secretory granules. By contrast, G429E perforin was correctly processed, stored, and released, but the rat basophil leukemia cells possessed reduced cytotoxicity. The defective function of G429E perforin mapped downstream of exocytosis and was due to its reduced ability to bind lipid membranes in a calcium-dependent manner.

However, the evolution of slender aerodynamically advantageous streamers is also predicted by an alternative hypothesis, which suggests that such a trait could develop primarily to ameliorate the aerodynamic cost of a long size-dimorphic tail. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we have investigated for the effect on manoeuvrability of trimming the tips of the outer tail feathers into short streamers, without lengthening these feathers, in two streamerless hirundine species-the house martin (Delichon urbica) and the sand martin (Riparia riparia). This allowed us to examine the aerodynamic costs and benefits of streamers at an early evolutionary stage that predates elongation of the outermost tail feathers through female choice. We showed that such initial streamers enhance manoeuvrability in streamerless hirundines, confirming the findings of recent studies. However, in contrast to these studies, we showed that improved manoeuvrability resulting from streamers could arise before the outermost tail feathers have become elongated (e.g. owing to female choice). The occurrence of such an aerodynamic advantage depends on the ancestral shape of a forked tail. This provides support for the hypothesis that streamers, like those in the barn swallow, might evolve initially purely through natural selection for enhanced manoeuvrability. © 2004 The Royal Society.","Bird flight; Feather shape; Hirundinidae; Natural selection; Sexual selection; Tail streamer","flight; natural selection; ornamentation; secondary sexual characteristics; sexual selection; tail feather; animal experiment; article; bird; controlled study; Delichon urbica; feather; female; flying; male; natural selection; nonhuman; priority journal; Riparia riparia; sexual selection; tail; analysis of variance; animal; biomechanics; comparative study; evolution; feather; histology; physiology; songbird; tail; Delichon urbica; Hirundo rustica; Riparia riparia; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Biomechanics; Evolution; Feathers; Flight, Animal; Songbirds; Tail"

We tested for heterogeneity in stable-isotope profiles (δ15N, δ13C, δD) of feathers grown in the African winter quarters from a Danish breeding population of adult barn swallows, Hirundo rustica. Deuterium isotope values did not provide useful information on population segregation of wintering swallows in Africa. However, both δ15N and δ13C values showed a clearly bimodal distribution with 6% belonging to one category and the remaining birds belonging to another category, resulting in this population comprising three categories of birds. Adults belonging to the two categories of δ13C isotope profiles differed weakly in morphology for several different characters. The frequency and the size of second broods differed between categories of δ13C isotope profiles. Phenotypes of nestlings from the first brood in terms of tarsus length, body mass and T-cell response differed significantly between the two δ15N isotope categories, suggesting that conditions during winter carried over to the breeding season at least as late as the first brood.

Two recent studies, however, found no association between type 1 diabetes and blood NKT cell levels in humans and consequently rejected a link between the onset of diabetes and NKT cell deficiency. This cast considerable doubts on the potential for NKT cell-based clinical applications and challenged the validity of the NOD mouse as a model of human type 1 diabetes. We now report that NKT cell levels in blood are a poor representation of those in other organs. Strikingly, systemic NKT cell deficiencies were identified in NOD mice with normal, or even raised, blood levels.

We used a comparative approach to investigate the relationship between a component of host immune function (which reflects the evolutionary history of parasite-induced natural selection) and dispersal in birds. We used a sample of 46 species of birds for which we had obtained field estimates of T-cell response for nestlings, mainly from our own field studies in Denmark and Spain. Bird species with longer natal, but not with longer breeding dispersal distances had a stronger mean T-cell-mediated immune response in nestlings than species with short dispersal distances. That was also the case when controlling for the potentially confounding effect of migration from breeding to wintering area, which is known from previous studies to be positively associated with dispersal distance. These relationships held even when controlling for similarity among species because of common ancestry. Avian hosts with a larger number of different breeding habitats had weaker mean T-cell-mediated immune responses than habitat specialists. This relationship held even when controlling for similarity among species because of common ancestry. Therefore, T-cell-mediated immunity is an important predictor of evolutionary changes in dispersal ability among common European birds.","Breeding dispersal; Cell-mediated immunity; Ecological plasticity; Natal dispersal; Phytohaemagglutinin","phytohemagglutinin; bird; dispersal; host-parasite interaction; immunity; local adaptation; natal dispersal; parasitism; animal; article; bird; cellular immunity; comparative study; demography; Denmark; environment; evolution; genetics; geography; immunology; parasitology; phylogeny; physiology; population migration; Spain; Animal Migration; Animals; Birds; Demography; Denmark; Environment; Evolution; Geography; Immunity, Cellular; Phylogeny; Phytohemagglutinins; Spain; Animalia; Aves"

Residues known to be critical for CD28 signaling were mutated from tyrosine to phenylalanine at position 170 or proline to alanine at positions 187 and 190. Primary mouse T cells expressing either of the mutant receptors demonstrated impaired cytokine (IFN-γ and GM-CSF) production and decreased proliferation after antigen ligation in vitro and decreased antitumor efficacy in vivo compared with T cells expressing the wild-type scFv-CD28-ζ receptor, suggesting a key signaling role for the CD28 component of the scFv-CD28-ζ receptor. Importantly, cell surface expression, binding capacity and cytolytic activity mediated by the scFv-CD28-ζ receptor were not diminished by either mutation.

Second, pre-existing CTLs (induced by ovalbumin peptide-priming) increased the antibody response to a second unrelated antigen (β-galactosidase) co-immunized with ovalbumin.

The stressing effect of herbivory could also produce instability in the development of plant modules, and measures of such instability may reflect the fitness consequences of herbivory if instability is related to components of plant fitness. We analyse the relationships between herbivory, developmental instability and production of female flowers and fruits of holm oak Quercus ilex trees by means of herbivore removal experiments. Removal of leaf herbivores reduced herbivory rates at the tree level, but had no effect on mean production of female flowers or mature fruits, whereas herbivory tended to enhance flower production and had no effect on fruit abortion at the shoot level. Differences in herbivory levels between shoots of the same branch did not affect the size and fluctuating asymmetry of intact leaves. These results indicate compensation for herbivory at the tree level and over-compensation at the shoot level in terms of allocation of resources to female flower production. Removal of insect herbivores produced an increase in the mean developmental instability of leaves at the tree level in the year following the insecticide treatment, and there was a direct relationship between herbivory rates in the current year and leaf fluctuating asymmetry the following year irrespective of herbivore removal treatment. Finally, the production of pistillate flowers and fruits by trees was inversely related to the mean fluctuating asymmetry of leaves growing the same year. Leaf fluctuating asymmetry was thus an estimator of the stressing effects of herbivory on adult trees, an effect that was delayed to the following year. As leaf fluctuating asymmetry was also related to tree fecundity, asymmetry levels provided a sensitive measure of plant performance under conditions of compensatory responses to herbivory. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Compensation; Flower production; Fluctuating asymmetry; Leaves; Spatial scales","compensation; developmental stability; fecundity; fitness; fluctuating asymmetry; herbivory; removal experiment; animal; article; feeding behavior; fertility; flower; fruit; larva; moth; oak; physiology; plant; Animals; Feeding Behavior; Fertility; Flowers; Fruit; Larva; Moths; Plants, Edible; Quercus; Ilex; Insecta; Quercus; Quercus ilex"

Approximately half the cohort of perforin gene-targeted mice succumbed to spontaneous disseminated B cell lymphomas and in mice that also lacked β2m, the lymphomas developed earlier (by more than 100 d) and with greater incidence (84%). B cell lymphomas from perforin/β2m gene-targeted mice effectively primed cell-mediated cytotoxicity and perforin, but not IFN-γ, IL-12, or IL-18, was absolutely essential for tumor rejection. Activated NK1.1+ and γδTCR+ T cells were abundant at the tumor site, and transplanted tumors were strongly rejected by either, or both, of these cell types. Blockade of a number of different known costimulatory pathways failed to prevent tumor rejection. These results reflect a critical role for NK cells and γδTCR+ T cells in innate immune surveillance of B cell lymphomas, mediated by as yet undetermined pathway(s) of tumor recognition.","Effector; Immunosurveillance; NK cell; Perforin; Tumor","beta 2 microglobulin; CD16 antigen; CD1d antigen; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; perforin; T lymphocyte receptor delta chain; T lymphocyte receptor gamma chain; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; B cell lymphoma; cancer immunology; controlled study; cytokine production; immunosurveillance; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; priority journal; T lymphocyte; tumor rejection; Animals; beta 2-Microglobulin; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Flow Cytometry; Graft Rejection; Immunity, Natural; Killer Cells, Natural; Lymphoma, B-Cell; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neoplasm Transplantation; Neoplasms, Experimental; Peritoneum; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins; T-Lymphocytes"

These cells up-regulate the expression of the inhibitory CD94-NKG2A receptor complex and the activation markers CD154 and killer cell, lectin-like-receptor G1.

The enzyme is almost exclusively expressed in NK cell types. Granzyme M cleaves at the carboxy side of amino acids with long, hydrophobic side chains like Met, Leu, and Nle. To further study the substrate specificity of the enzyme, a series of peptide thiobenzyl esters was synthesized. The hydrolysis of the substrates with murine and human recombinant forms of granzyme M was observed. The results show that the enzyme has a strong preference for Pro at the P2 position and Ala, Ser, or Asp at the P3 position. These results suggest that the protein residues of the S2 and S3 subsites form important binding interactions that aid in the selection of specific natural substrates for granzyme M. A series of inhibitors was also tested with granzyme M. None of the inhibitors were effective inactivators of granzyme M, including the general serine protease inhibitor, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, which is usually a potent inactivator of serine proteases. This suggests that inhibition of granzyme M may be difficult. Also reported for the first time is the method utilized to isolate granzyme M used in this and previous publications.

After precipitation events, rivers often carry elevated silt loads, where as lakes generally remain free from suspended silt and sediment. To examine the physiological effects of silt on rock bass, we conducted a series of experiments using fish from Lake Opinicon and the Grand River in Ontario. Ultrasonic Doppler flow probes were surgically affixed around the ventral aorta to monitor cardiovascular performance. After recovery from surgery replicated treatment groups were exposed to incremental increases in silt load (made from bentonite slurry), while cardiac output and its two components, heart rate and stroke volume, were measured simultaneously. Although both groups of rock bass responded significantly to low concentrations of silt (10 NTU), the response by riverine rock bass was rapidly extinguished by acclimation or physiological adjustment. Compensatory mechanisms to minimize cardiac (and respiratory) disruption attributable to increases in suspended silt appear to be inherent in rock bass of riverine origin. These fish appear to fully compensate for interference in gas exchange at the gill surfaces 60 min after initial exposure. In contrast, individual lacustrine rock bass were highly variable in their response to elevated silt concentrations. Changes in stroke volume and cardiac output suggested no clear compensatory mechanism or strategy to cope with increased silt levels. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we 1) present a case study that used a fixed antenna array and continuously scanning coded receiving system to monitor the movement of radio-tagged smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in a thermal discharge canal on Lake Erie during the winter of 1998/1999, and 2) evaluate the use of fixed telemetry arrays for environmental monitoring. Although the number of radiotagged bass in the canal decreased gradually over time, fish spent the majority of the winter in the canal. When in the canal, bass selected areas upstream of the tempering pumps where water was the warmest. This region was also high in habitat complexity, had adequate velocity refuges, and abundant forage. Despite residing in the thermal effluent throughout the winter, none of the fish monitored were observed to participate in reproductive activities in the canal in the Spring. Interestingly, during a biofouling chlorination pulse in May, 50% of radiotagged fish still residing in the canal left and did not return during the monitoring period. Utility infrastructure accessible to fish, including thermal effluents, should be considered as fish habitat and managed accordingly to minimize mortality and sublethal effects on resident and transient fish. Fixed telemetry arrays that permit the continuous monitoring of fish behavior as described in this paper are widely applicable to many issues in environmental management, monitoring, and conservation.","Environmental monitoring; Fish behavior; Pollution; Radio telemetry; Thermal effluent","Conservation; Ecosystems; Fisheries; Telemetering; Thermal effects; Environmental monitoring; Fish behaviours; Environmental engineering; lake water; behavioral response; biotelemetry; environmental monitoring; thermal pollution; winter; animal behavior; article; bass; biodiversity; Canada; effluent; environmental monitoring; fish; forage; lake; movement (physiology); nonhuman; reproduction; seasonal variation; telemetry; water temperature; winter; Animals; Bass; Behavior, Animal; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Heat; Mortality; Movement; Population Dynamics; Power Plants; Survival Analysis; Telemetry; Water; Great Lakes; Lake Erie; North America; Animalia; Micropterus; Micropterus dolomieu"

The prevalence and the abundance of the chewing lice did not differ significantly between adult male and female hosts. The resemblance in parasite intensity of H. malleus of offspring and their parents was positive and highly significant, and an analysis of extra-pair paternity in the host allowed partitioning of this resemblance between genetic and common environment effects. There was no significant resemblance in parasite intensity between extra-pair offspring and their foster parents, although the resemblance remained for within-pair offspring.

Across 14 species of birds, spleen mass was significantly positively correlated with the NAO index, while the delayed effect of NAO on spleen mass was not significant. Spleen mass was positively related to body condition, but body condition did not depend significantly on NAO or delayed NAO effects. Bird species with a strong positive effect of NAO on spleen mass tended to have small spleens for their body size, while species with a strong negative effect of NAO on spleen mass tended to have relatively large spleens. Since bird species with relatively large spleen have been shown to suffer more from the negative effects of parasites, we can infer that the effects of climate as indexed by NAO on the size of the spleen depends on the importance of parasite-mediated natural selection.","Body mass; Delayed climatic effects; North Atlantic Oscillation; Parasite-induced mortality","avifauna; body condition; body mass; climate conditions; natural selection; North Atlantic Oscillation; adaptation; animal; article; bird; climate; female; health status; histology; immune system; immunology; male; parasitology; physiology; population dynamics; spleen; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Birds; Climate; Female; Health Status; Immune System; Male; Population Dynamics; Spleen; Animalia; Aves"

This shows that the population ecological consequences of an expected climate change will depend on how climate affects the environmental stochasticity in the population process.

Acquired immunity provides hosts with efficient mechanisms of anti-parasite defence, but the effect of senescence on immunocompetence has never been studied in natural populations. In the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), primary antibody response to an antigen during one breeding season declined with age in females, while secondary response during the following breeding season declined with age in both sexes. Parasite-mediated sexual selection theory posits that male secondary sexual characters reveal resistance to parasites. Males with large tail ornaments had stronger primary response, retained larger antibody levels until the following year, but did not differ in secondary response compared with short-tailed males, as predicted if ornamentation reflects resistance to parasites. This is the first study showing that immunocompetence declines with age in any vertebrate under natural conditions.","Ageing; Humoral immunity; Parasite-mediated sexual selection; Secondary sexual characters; Senescence","antiparasite defense; immune response; immunocompetence; ornamentation; secondary sexual characteristics; senescence; sex-related difference; aging; animal; antibody production; article; body constitution; female; host parasite interaction; immunocompetence; immunology; male; parasitology; physiology; sexual behavior; sexual development; songbird; Aging; Animals; Antibody Formation; Body Constitution; Female; Host-Parasite Relations; Immunocompetence; Male; Sex Characteristics; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Songbirds; Animalia; Hirundo; Hirundo rustica; Passeri; Vertebrata"

We tested this hypothesis using the elevated mutation rates in the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) of the Chernobyl region of Ukraine as a model system. A great deal is known about the relative importance of different characters for male mating success in this species. The importance of phenotypic characters for male mating success was quantified based on a long-term study of a Danish breeding population, by expressing phenotypic differences between mated and unmated males as the difference between log-transformed mean values. For field samples from Ukraine we likewise expressed the difference in male phenotype between individuals living in a relatively uncontaminated area and individuals from the Chernobyl region as the difference between log-transformed mean values. The standardized difference in male phenotype between the two regions in Ukraine for the 41 different characters was strongly positively correlated with the standardized difference in male phenotype between mated and unmated males from Denmark. The standardized difference in male phenotype between the two regions in Ukraine was significantly positively associated with sexual size dimorphism. However, the standardized difference in male phenotype between mated and unmated males was a much better predictor of standardized difference in male phenotype between the two regions in Ukraine than was the standardized difference in sexual size dimorphism, expressed as the difference between log-transformed mean values for males and females. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that traits most important for sexual selection are particularly susceptible to the effects of deleterious mutations.","Antioxidants; Chernobyl; Condition dependence; Hirundo rustica; Mate choice; Mutation; Sexual selection","Chernobyl accident; mate choice; mutation; radioactive pollution; secondary sexual characteristics; sexual selection; animal; article; body constitution; comparative study; congenital malformation; genetic selection; genetics; histology; male; mutation; pathophysiology; phenotype; physiology; radiation exposure; radiobiology; sexual development; songbird; Ukraine; Abnormalities, Radiation-Induced; Animals; Body Constitution; Male; Mutation; Phenotype; Radiobiology; Selection (Genetics); Sex Characteristics; Songbirds; Ukraine; Denmark; Ukraine; Animalia; Aves; Hirundinidae; Hirundo; Hirundo rustica; Passeri"

In this study, we identified two blastocyst MHC gene transcripts encoding a full-length α-chain (bc1) and an alternatively spliced form lacking the α2 domain (bc2), which may be homologous to HLA-G1 and HLA-G2, respectively. Both placenta and a teratocarcinoma cell line predominantly expressed the bc2 transcript. When these cDNAs were expressed in TAP-deficient RMA-S or TAP-sufficient RMA cells, only bc1 protein was expressed on the surface of RMA cells, but both bc1 and bc2 proteins were retained in the cytoplasm of RMA-S cells. Significantly, the RMA-S cells expressing either bc1 or bc2 were protected from lysis by NK cells in vitro. This protection was at least partly mediated by up-regulation of Qa-1b expression on the surface of RMA-S cells, which engaged the CD94/NKG2A inhibitory receptor on NK cells. More importantly, the bc1- or bc2-expressing RMA-S cells were significantly protected from NK cell-mediated rejection in vivo.

Because temperature also influences the activity rates of fish, it has the potential to alter the chronology of parental care activities and possibly the immediate or future reproductive success of individual fish. We conducted a study in a thermal effluent canal on Lake Erie to examine the influence of fluctuating thermal regimes on parental care and reproductive success of smallmouth bass. In general, parental care activity of these smallmouth bass was higher than previously reported for non-thermally altered environments and did not follow conventional stage-specific patterns. In fact, individual fish exhibited very different patterns, with no consistency among individuals. Despite these behavioral alterations and the thermal instability in the canal, the reproductive success of smallmouth bass (i.e., the percentage of nesting males that successfully produced free-swimming fry) was high relative to other published values. Behavioral alterations observed were variable and did not conform with theory. However, the high level of reproductive success implies that fish are capable of adjusting energetic expenditures in response to a suite of conditions and risks. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested predictions from this hypothesis using acorns of holm oaks Quercus ilex as a model system. Fecundity of oak trees was negatively related to mean fluctuating asymmetry of leaves, and abortion rates were positively related to leaf fluctuating asymmetry in at least one population. Aborted acorns were asymmetric in 83-99% of cases in three samples, while mature acorns were only asymmetric in 57-78% of cases. Acorn asymmetry was unrelated to germination probability and germination date, and had no significant effect on number of leaves, leaf mass, stem mass, seedling height or leaf area of seedlings. However, acorn asymmetry affected the trade-off between number and size of leaves in seedlings. Seedlings from asymmetric acorns showed a positive relationship between acorn size and number of leaves, but no relationships between acorn size and leaf area, while symmetric acorns showed the opposite. A positive relationship between acorn size and number of leaves in spring was found for naturally emerged seedlings that died during their first summer, whereas the number of leaves produced by surviving seedlings did not depend on acorn size. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that stressed trees selectively abort propagules of low viability, and that developmental selection acts on a measure of developmental instability of fruits.","Acorn; Fluctuating asymmetry; Leaf number; Leaf size; Maternal effect","abortion; developmental biology; developmental stability; fluctuating asymmetry; fruiting; viability; adaptation; article; fertility; fruit; growth, development and aging; oak; phenotype; plant leaf; plant seed; seedling; survival; Adaptation, Physiological; Fertility; Fruit; Phenotype; Plant Leaves; Quercus; Seedling; Seeds; Survival Analysis; Ilex; Quercus; Quercus ilex; Spermatophyta"

Mothers allocated more antibodies against a pathogen to eggs with a daughter than a son. However, concentration of antioxidants was independent of embryonic sex. Sex-dependent allocation was independent of paternal attractiveness. Thus, mothers adjusted allocation of substances to offspring in a complex manner, that may be part of a strategy of favouritism of daughters, which have larger mortality than sons.

R331 grew in tissue culture in vitro at a rate similar to that of the parental Renca cell line but formed larger and more numerous colonies than parental Renca in soft agar.

Perceived differences in winter activity were reflected in cardiac responses; e.g. basal cardiac values were lowest for largemouth bass, highest for white bass, and intermediate for black crappie. In addition, cardiac recovery was most rapid for white bass, slowest for largemouth bass and intermediate for black crappie. When disturbed at low temperatures, largemouth bass and black crappie elevated cardiac output principally through increases in heart rate despite substantial decreases in stroke volume. Conversely, white bass principally used stroke volume modulation to change cardiac output. The results of this study indicate that different species respond differently to exercise at low temperatures.

Rae-1β expression stimulated NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-γ secretion in vitro, but not proliferation. Surprisingly, only NK cell perforin-mediated cytotoxicity, but not production of IFN-γ, was critical for the rejection of Rae-1β-expressing tumor cells in vivo. This distinct requirement for perforin activity contrasts with the NK cell-mediated rejection of MHC class I-deficient RMA-S tumor cells expressing other activating ligands such as CD70 and CD80.

Given that T cells require both primary and costimulatory signals for optimal activation and that many tumors do not express critical costimulatory ligands, modified single-chain Ab receptors have been engineered to codeliver CD28 costimulation. In this study, we have compared the antitumor potency of primary T lymphocytes expressing carcinoembryonic Ag (CEA)-reactive chimeric receptors that incorporate either TCR-ζ or CD28/TCR-ζ signaling.

The observed enhanced antitumor activity of T cells expressing the scFv-CD28-ζ receptor was critically dependent on perforin and the production of IFN-γ.

Herein we have compared disease progression in mice additionally deficient in the inflammatory mediator TNF. Unlike pfp/FasL double-deficient mice (TNF+/+ pfp-/- gld), mice lacking functional TNF, FasL and pfp (TNF-/- pfp-/- gld) were comparatively fertile, with the majority of mice not suffering severe pancreatitis or hysterosalphingitis in the first 5 months of life. The mean lifespan of TNF-/- pfp-/- gld mice was 217 ± 79 days compared with 69 ± 10 days for TNF+/+ pfp-/- gld mice and the majority of moribund TNF-/- pfp-/- gld mice appeared to die as a result of severe pancreatitis, suggesting that loss of TNF was not completely protective. At 8 weeks of age, characteristics associated with the gld phenotype, such as expansion of B220+ CD4- CD8- T cells, lymphadenopathy and hypergammaglobulinemia were comparable between TNF+/+ pfp-/- gld and TNF-/- pfp-/- gld mice, although the lymphoid organs of TNF+/+ pfp-/- gld mice contained greater numbers of B220+ CD4- CD8- T cells, macrophages and T cells. We conclude that TNF is necessary for the full manifestation of immune dysregulation caused by pfp/FasL-deficiency, in particular in the early and overwhelming tissue infiltration and destruction caused by inflammatory cells.","Apoptosis; Immunodeficiency diseases; Inflammation; Rodent; Transgenic/ knockout","FAS ligand; perforin; tumor necrosis factor; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; disease course; female; histopathology; hypergammaglobulinemia; immunofluorescence; immunopathology; infertility; inflammatory cell; lifespan; lymphadenopathy; lymphoid organ; macrophage; male; mouse; nonhuman; organ weight; pancreatitis; phenotype; protein deficiency; salpingitis; T lymphocyte; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Progression; Endometritis; Fas Ligand Protein; Female; Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Infertility, Female; Longevity; Lymphatic Diseases; Lymphoproliferative Disorders; Male; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Pancreatitis; Phenotype; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins; Salpingitis; Splenomegaly; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Animalia; Rodentia"

In addition, we studied sex-allocation in relation to parentage, parental age and expression of a secondary sexual character of fathers. Molecular sexing was conducted using the sex chromosome-linked avian CHD1 gene. Sex of the offspring was not associated with laying or hatching order. None of nine morphological, serological and immunological variables varied in relation to offspring sex. Sexual dimorphism did not vary in relation to parental age and expression of a paternal secondary sexual character. The proportion of sons declined with brood size. Individual males and females had a similar proportion of sons during consecutive breeding years. The proportion of sons of individual females declined with age, but increased with the expression of a secondary sexual character of their current mate. The generalized lack of variation in sexual dimorphism among nestlings may suggest that barn swallows do not differentially invest in sons vs. daughters. Alternatively, male offspring may require different parental effort Compared to their female siblings in order to attain the same morphological state. The lack of variation in offspring sexual dimorphism with paternal ornamentation suggests no adjustment of overall parental effort in relation to reproductive value of the two sexes. However, male-biased sex ratio among offspring of highly ornamented males may represent an adaptive sex-allocation strategy because the expression of male ornaments is heritable and highly ornamented males are at a sexual selection advantage.","Cost of sons and daughters; Hirundo rustica; Laying order; Parental age; Secondary sexual characters; Sex ratio","Age Factors; Animal; Evolution; Female; Male; Sex Behavior, Animal; Sex Characteristics; Songbirds; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Survival Rate; Age Factors; Animals; Evolution; Female; Male; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Survival Rate; Aves; Galliformes; Hirundinidae; Hirundo; Hirundo rustica; age; animal; article; evolution; female; histology; male; physiology; sexual behavior; sexual development; songbird; survival rate"

Although numerous studies of the effects of IFN-γ on primary-solid-tumor growth have been performed and several potential mechanisms for its efficacy have been proposed, it remains unclear how IFN-γ modulates tumor progression and whether it exerts its effects indirectly via host cells or directly by interacting with tumor cells. Using the well-characterized mouse metastatic mammary carcinoma 4T1 in a postsurgery setting, IFN-γ-deficient mice were found to have significantly shorter survival time relative to wild-type mice, demonstrating that IFN-γ is also a critical component in regulating innate immunity to metastatic disease. Experiments quantifying lung and liver metastasis indicate that decreased survival of IFN-γ-deficient mice is attributable to increased metastatic disease. To determine whether IFN-γ is acting directly on the tumor cells, IFN-γ-nonresponsive 4T1 cells were generated by transfection (4t1/IRt). Metastasis experiments with 4T1/IRt demonstrated that IFN-γ mediates its effects via host-derived cells, rather than by directly affecting tumor growth. To identify the population of cells responsible for IFN-γ efficacy, perforin-deficient, T-cell subset-depleted, natural killer cell-depleted, or carrageenan-treated phagocytic cell-depleted mice were inoculated with 4T1 and assessed for primary tumor growth and metastatic disease. None of the conditions altered primary tumor growth; however, the carrageenan treatment significantly increased metastatic disease in the liver and lungs. Survival experiments in 4T1-inoculated, carrageenan-treated mice confirmed that the elimination of phagocytic cells significantly reduces survival time and yields a survival phenotype comparable with IFN-γ deficiency. Therefore, IFN-γ is a critical component of innate immunity to metastatic mammary carcinoma that probably mediates its effects via host-derived phagocytic cells.",,"carrageenan; gamma interferon; perforin; animal experiment; animal model; article; breast carcinoma; cell proliferation; cell survival; controlled study; female; genetic transfection; liver metastasis; lung metastasis; metastasis; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; phagocyte; priority journal; T lymphocyte subpopulation; tumor immunity; Animals; Cell Division; Female; Interferon Type II; Killer Cells, Natural; Liver Neoplasms, Experimental; Lung Neoplasms; Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Phagocytes; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins; T-Lymphocytes; Transfection"

Structures involved in behavioural visual information processing are expected to coevolve with enlargement of the brain. Because birds are mainly vision-oriented animals, we tested the predictions that adaptation to different foraging constraints can result in eye size evolution, and that species with large eyes have evolved large brains to cope with the increased amount of visual input. Using a comparative approach, we investigated the relationship between eye size and brain size, and the effect of prey capture technique and nocturnality on these traits. After controlling for allometric effects, there was a significant, positive correlation between relative brain size and relative eye size. Variation in relative eye and brain size were significantly and positively related to prey capture technique and nocturnality when a potentially confounding variable, aquatic feeding, was controlled statistically in multiple regression of independent linear contrasts. Applying a less robust, brunching approach, these patterns also emerged, with the exception that relative brain size did not vary with prey capture technique. Our findings suggest that relative eye size and brain size have coevolved in birds in response to nocturnal activity and, at least partly, to capture of mobile prey.","Adaptation; Behaviour; Brain size; Coevolution; Eye size; Vision","adaptation; behavior; bird; coevolution; eye; prey capture; vision; adaptation; allometry; animal behavior; animal tissue; article; bird; brain function; brain size; evolution; eye; multiple regression; nonhuman; prey; priority journal; vision; visual information; animal; bird; brain; darkness; evolution; eye; histology; multivariate analysis; phylogeny; physiology; predation; statistical model; Animal; Birds; Brain; Darkness; Evolution; Eye; Linear Models; Multivariate Analysis; Phylogeny; Predatory Behavior; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Animals; Brain; Darkness; Linear Models; Multivariate Analysis; Phylogeny; Animalia; Aves"

NK1.1+ NKT cells, including CD4+ and CD4-CD8- subsets, appeared at days 7-8 but remained a minor subset until at least 3 wk of age. Using intrathymic transfer experiments, CD4+NK1.1- NKT cells gave rise to NK1.1+ NKT cells (including CD4+ and CD4- subsets), but not vice-versa. This maturation step was not required for NKT cells to migrate to other tissues, as NK1.1- NKT cells were detected in liver and spleen as early as day 8 after birth, and the majority of NKT cells among recent thymic emigrants (RTE) were NK1.1-.

The murine renal cancer Renca has been used as a model for developing new preclinical approaches to the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Successful cytokine-based approaches require CD8+ T cells, but the exact mechanisms by which T cells mediate therapeutic benefit have not been completely identified. After successful biological therapy of Renca in BALB/c mice, we generated CTLs in vitro using mixed lymphocyte tumor cultures. These CTL mediated tumor-specific H-2Kd-restricted lysis and production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and Fas ligand (FasL) in response to Renca. CTL used both granule- and FasL-mediated mechanisms to lyse Renca, although granule-mediated killing was the predominant lytic mechanism in vitro. The cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α increased the sensitivity of Renca cells to CTL lysis by both granule- and FasL-mediated death pathways. Adoptive transfer of these anti-Renca CTL into tumor-bearing mice cured most mice of established experimental pulmonary metastases, and successfully treated mice were immune to tumor rechallenge. Interestingly, we were able to establish Renca-specific CTL from mice gene targeted for perforin (pfp-/-) mice. Although these pfp-/- CTL showed reduced cytotoxic activity against Renca, their IFN-γ production in the presence of Renca targets was equivalent to that of wild-type CTL, and adoptive transfer of pfp-/- CTL was as efficient as wild-type CTL in causing regression of established Renca pulmonary metastases. Therefore, although granule-mediated killing is of paramount importance for CTL-mediated lysis in vitro, some major in vivo effector mechanisms clearly are independent of perforin.",,"FAS ligand; gamma interferon; perforin; adoptive transfer; animal cell; article; cell granule; cell killing; cell specificity; controlled study; cytokine production; cytolysis; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; cytotoxicity; gene targeting; immunotherapy; in vitro study; in vivo study; kidney cancer; kidney carcinoma; lung metastasis; mouse strain; nonhuman; priority journal; tumor regression; Animals; Antigens, CD95; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Cell Line, Transformed; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte; Fas Ligand Protein; Immunotherapy, Adoptive; Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1; Kidney Neoplasms; Ligands; Lung Neoplasms; Lymphocyte Activation; Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1; Melanoma, Experimental; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C3H; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Inbred DBA; Mice, Knockout; Neoplasm Transplantation; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic; TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"

Using gene-targeted mice and antibody treatments, the critical need for interleukin 12 (IL-12), IFN-γ and NK cells has been shown in the antimetastatic activity of α-GalCer in the lungs and the liver. By contrast, in lung and liver metastasis models, cytotoxic molecules expressed by NK cells and NKT cells (perforin, Fas ligand, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) and an NKT cell-secreted cytokine, IL-4, were not necessary for the antitumor activity of α-GalCer.

Most importantly, after adoptive transfer of α-GalCer-reactive NKT cells or NK cells into NKT cell-deficient, IFN-γ-deficient, or RAG-1-deficient mice, it was demonstrated that the sequential production of IFN-γ by NKT cells and NK cells was absolutely required to reconstitute the antimetastatic activity of α-GalCer. © 2002 by The American Society of Hematology.",,"antibody; FAS ligand; galactosylceramide; gamma interferon; interleukin 12; interleukin 18; interleukin 4; perforin; RAG1 protein; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; adoptive transfer; animal cell; animal experiment; antineoplastic activity; article; cell activation; cytokine production; gene targeting; liver metastasis; lung metastasis; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; priority journal; T lymphocyte; tumor rejection; Adoptive Transfer; Animals; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Galactosylceramides; Interferon Type II; Interleukin-12; Interleukin-18; Killer Cells, Natural; Liver Neoplasms; Lung Neoplasms; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Neoplasm Metastasis; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins"

Thus, mutations are assumed to give rise to deviant phenotypes that are generally selected against. Radioactive contamination in the Chernobyl region of Ukraine is associated with a significant increase by a factor two to 10 in mutation rate in microsatellite markers of the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica. Barn swallows from Chernobyl had a temporally constant, elevated frequency of partial albinism compared to the situation before radioactive contamination and compared to birds from a control area. Albinism disproportionately affected the carotenoid-based plumage of the head, suggesting that carotenoid metabolism is particularly susceptible to the effects of radiation. Individuals with partially albinistic plumage had, on average, lower mean phenotypic values than other birds, and this was particularly the case for males. Furthermore, differences in phenotypic variation, as determined using Levene's test, were significantly larger in partial albinos compared to nonalbinos in males, but not in females, even though the null expectation would be the opposite due to the lower mean phenotypic values of partial albinos. Although small phenotypes were commonly associated with germline mutations, there was no general decrease in overall body size during the period 1991-2000, implying that small individuals were selected against. Because partial albinism is disfavored by natural selection, the effects of mutations are deleterious, giving rise to a balance between mutation and selection.","Albinism; Carotenoids; Mutation; Phenotypic coefficient of variation; Phenotypic correlation; Radiation; Selection","albinism; Chernobyl accident; mutation; phenotype; radioactive pollution; selection; Ukraine; Aves; Hirundinidae; Hirundo rustica; albinism; animal; article; body constitution; genetic recombination; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; histology; mutation; phenotype; physiology; radiation accident; radioactive waste; songbird; Ukraine; Accidents, Radiation; Albinism; Animal; Body Constitution; Mutation; Phenotype; Radioactive Fallout; Recombination, Genetic; Selection (Genetics); Songbirds; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Ukraine; Variation (Genetics)"

Here, we have generated a congenic line of NOD mice (NOD.b-Nkrp1b) which express the allelic NK1.1 marker, enabling the direct study of NK and NKT cells in NOD mice. Major deficiencies in both populations were identified when NOD.b-Nkrp1b mice were compared with C57BL/6 and BALB.B6-Cmv1r mice by flow cytometry. The decrease in numbers of peripheral NK cells was associated with an increase in their numbers in the bone marrow, suggesting that a defect in NK cell export may be involved. In contrast, the most severe deficiency of NKT cells found was in the thymus, indicating that defects in thymic production were probably responsible. The deficiencies in NK cell activity in NOD mice could only partly be accounted for by the reduced numbers of NK cells, and fewer NKT cells from NOD mice produced IL-4 following stimulation, suggesting that NK and NKT cells from NOD mice shared functional deficiencies in addition to their numerical deficiencies. Despite the relative lack of IL-4 production by NOD NKT cells, adoptive transfer of αβTCR+NK1.1+ syngeneic NKT cells into 3-week-old NOD recipients successfully prevented the onset of spontaneous diabetes. As both NK and NKT cells play roles in regulating immune responses, we postulate that the synergistic defects reported here contribute to the susceptibility of NOD mice to autoimmune disease.","Autoimmunity; Cytokines; Cytotoxicity; Immunoregulation; Type 1 diabetes","cell marker; T lymphocyte receptor; adolescent; adoptive transfer; allele; analysis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; autoimmune disease; bone marrow; cell activity; cell count; cell transport; congenic strain; controlled study; cytokine production; disease predisposition; female; flow cytometry; immune response; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; lymphocyte subpopulation; male; mouse; mouse strain; natural killer cell; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; recipient; regulatory mechanism; stimulation; thymus; Animals; Antigens; Antigens, Surface; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Flow Cytometry; Incidence; Interleukin-4; Killer Cells, Natural; Lectins, C-Type; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, Transgenic; Proteins; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta; T-Lymphocytes"

The effects of parasites on clutch size variation among species can be complex, however, because different parasites can induce age-specific differences in mortality that can cause clutch size to evolve in different directions. We provide a conceptual argument that differences in immunocompetence among species should integrate differences in overall levels of parasite-induced mortality to which a species is exposed. We test this assumption and show that mortality caused by parasites is positively correlated with immunocompetence measured by cell-mediated measures. Under life history theory, clutch size should increase with increased adult mortality and decrease with increased juvenile mortality. Using immunocompetence as a general assay of parasite-induced mortality, we tested these predictions by using data for 25 species. We found that clutch size increased strongly with adult immunocompetence. In contrast, clutch size decreased weakly with increased juvenile immunocompetence. But, immunocompetence of juveniles may be constrained by selection on adults, and, when we controlled for adult immunocompetence, clutch size decreased with juvenile immunocompetence. Thus, immunocompetence seems to reflect evolutionary differences in parasite virulence experienced by species, and differences in age-specific parasite virulence appears to exert opposite selection on clutch size evolution.","Age-specific mortality; Evolution; Life history","age; article; controlled study; correlation function; immunocompetence; molecular evolution; mortality; nonhuman; parasite; parasite virulence; prediction; priority journal; species difference; Animals; Evolution; Immunocompetence; Parasites; Parasitic Diseases; Phytohemagglutinins; T-Lymphocytes"

As the rejection of many experimental cancers by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells is dependent on the pore-forming protein perforin (pfp), we examined pfp-deficient mice for increased cancer susceptibility. Here we show that pfp-deficient mice have a high incidence of malignancy in distinct lymphoid cell lineages (T, B, NKT), indicating a specific requirement for pfp in protection against lymphomagenesis. The susceptibility to lymphoma was accentuated by simultaneous lack of expression of the p53 gene, mutations in which also commonly predispose to human malignancies, including lymphoma. In contrast, the incidence and age of onset of sarcoma was unaffected in p53-deficient mice. Pfp-deficient mice were at least 1,000-fold more susceptible to these lymphomas when transplanted, compared with immunocompetent mice in which tumor rejection was controlled by CD8+ T lymphocytes. This study is the first that implicates direct cytotoxicity by lymphocytes in regulating lymphomagenesis.","Cytotoxic T lymphocyte; Lymphoma; Perforin; Surveillance; Tumor immunity","perforin; protein p53; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; B lymphocyte; cancer incidence; cancer susceptibility; controlled study; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; cytotoxicity; lymphoma; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; onset age; priority journal; protein expression; T lymphocyte; tumor rejection; Animals; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Graft Rejection; Humans; Lymphoma; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neoplasm Transplantation; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"

For example, metastasis of the MHC class I-deficient lymphoma, EL4-S3, was strictly controlled by NK cells using perforin either naturally or following therapy with high-dose IL-12. Intriguingly, in B16F10 and RM-1 tumor models both NK and NKT cells contribute to natural protection from tumor metastasis. In these models, a lower dose of IL-12 or delayed administration of IL-12 dictated a greater relative role of NKT cells in immune protection from tumor metastasis.

In particular, TNF provides essential signals for the formation of secondary lymphoid tissue structures and plays an important role in several physiological and pathological conditions that relate to its action in inflammation and leukocyte movement. The TNF-related family of membrane-anchored and secreted ligands also represents a major mechanism regulating cell death and cell survival. TNF was first described as an endotoxin-induced and macrophage secreted factor that caused haemorrhagic necrosis of tumor cells. Over the past two decades we have come to appreciate that T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells also produce TNF, yet no clear single role for lymphocyte-derived TNF has emerged.

Overexpression of Bcl-2 resulted in inhibition of multiple parameters of apoptosis in response to purified perforin and granzyme B, including DNA fragmentation, changes in light scatter profile indicating cell shrinkage and increased refractivity, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibited colony formation in clonogenic assays. Nevertheless, when exposed to cytotoxic lymphocytes, FDC-P1 and YAC-1 cells overexpressing Bcl-2 remained susceptible to death imparted by cytolytic granules, irrespective of whether the granules contained granzyme B. Thus, alternative granzyme B-independent pathways can be activated by intact lymphocytes to overcome Bcl-2-like inhibitors of apoptosis, enabling CTLs to overcome potential viral blocks to granzyme B-mediated cell death.","Apoptosis; Bcl-2; BHRF1; Granzyme; Mitochondrion","DNA fragment; glutamic acid; glycine; granzyme B; perforin; protein bcl 2; virus protein; animal cell; apoptosis; article; bone marrow culture; cell death; cell granule; cell membrane; cell protection; cell size; clonogenic assay; colony formation; controlled study; cytolysis; cytotoxic lymphocyte; exposure; gene mutation; gene overexpression; genetic transfection; human; human cell; light scattering; membrane potential; mitochondrial membrane; mouse; nonhuman; parameter; priority journal; protein expression; protein purification; Animal; Apoptosis; Gene Expression; Human; Jurkat Cells; Leukemia, Myeloid; Lymphoma; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mitochondria; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Serine Endopeptidases; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic; Transfection; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Viral Proteins"

In T helper cells, this process is controlled by chromatin changes and distal and proximal regulatory elements as well as specific transcription factors. Analogous events during cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) differentiation remain to be identified. This process is known, however, to be crucially regulated by interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (R) signals. It is accompanied by the induction of perforin expression via a mechanism that does not entail proximal regulatory elements. In this report, transgenically expressed human perforin gene locus DNAs demonstrate that IL-2R signals target two IL-2- dependent enhancers ~15 and 1 kilobase upstream of the promoter. The most distal enhancer may also respond to TCR signals. In transient transfections, both enhancers required two identically spaced Stat-like elements for their activation, which was abolished by expression of a dominant negative signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)5 molecule, whereas a constitutively active Stat5 molecule bypassed the requirement for IL-2R signals. These results provide a molecular explanation for the activation of the perforin gene during CTL differentiation and complement the analysis of animals deficient in the activation of the IL-2R Stat signaling pathway by establishing perforin as a target gene.","Cytotoxic T lymphocyte; IL-2 receptor; Perforin; T cell activation; Transgenic mouse","interleukin 2 receptor; perforin; stat5 protein; animal cell; article; controlled study; cytotoxic t lymphocyte; effector cell; gene activation; gene control; gene expression; gene induction; gene locus; gene targeting; helper cell; lymphocyte differentiation; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; rat; signal transduction; Animals; Base Sequence; Cell Line; DNA-Binding Proteins; Enhancer Elements (Genetics); Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Reporter; Humans; Interleukin-2; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Milk Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins; Receptors, Interleukin-2; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; RNA, Messenger; Signal Transduction; STAT5 Transcription Factor; T-Lymphocytes; Trans-Activation (Genetics); Trans-Activators; Transfection"

The intensity of carotenoid-based sexual coloration was compared among three populations of barn swallows Hirundo rustica differing in exposure to radioactive contamination. Lymphocyte and immunoglobulin concentrations were depressed, whereas the heterophil:lymphocyte ratio, an index of stress, was enhanced in Chernobyl swallows compared to controls. Spleen size was reduced in Chernobyl compared to that of two control populations. Sexual coloration varied significantly among populations, with the size of a secondary sexual character (the length of the outermost tail feathers) being positively related to coloration in the two control populations, but not in the Chernobyl population. Thus the positive covariation between coloration and sexual signalling disappeared in the population subject to intense radioactive contamination.

Studies of specific host-parasite systems and comparative analyses have revealed both supportive and conflicting evidence for these hypotheses. A metaanalysis of the available evidence revealed a negative relationship between parasite load and the expression of male secondary sexual characters. Experimental studies yielded more strongly negative relationships than observations did, and the relationships were more strongly negative for ectoparasites than for endoparasites. There was no significant difference in the magnitude of the negative effect for species with and without male parental care, or between behavioral and morphological secondary sexual characters. There was a significant difference between studies based on host immune function and those based on parasite loads, with stronger effects for measures of immune function, suggesting that the many negative results from previous analyses of parasite-mediated sexual selection may be explained because relatively benign parasites were studied. The multivariate analyses demonstrating strong effect sizes of immune function in relation to the expression of secondary sexual characters, and for species with male parental care as compared to those without, suggest that parasite resistance may be a general determinant of parasite-mediated sexual selection.",,"animal; article; clinical trial; female; genetic selection; histology; host parasite interaction; immune system; male; male genital system; meta analysis; physiology; reproduction; sexual behavior; Animals; Female; Genitalia, Male; Host-Parasite Relations; Immune System; Male; Reproduction; Selection (Genetics); Sexual Behavior, Animal; Animalia"

We have confirmed in C57BL/6 (B6) mice lacking perforin that peritoneal growth of MHC class I- RMA-S tumor cells in unprimed mice is controlled by perforin-dependent cytotoxicity mediated by CD3-NK1.1+ cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that B6 mice lacking tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are also significantly defective in their rejection of RMA-S, despite the fact that RMA-S is insensitive to TNF in vitro and that spleen NK cells from B6 and TNF-deficient mice are equally lytic towards RMA-S. NK cell recruitment into the peritoneum was abrogated in TNF-deficient mice challenged with RMA-S or RM-1, a B6 MHC class I- prostate carcinoma, compared with B6 or perforin-deficient mice. The reduced NK cell migration to the peritoneum of TNF-deficient mice correlated with the defective NK cell response to tumor in these mice. By contrast, a lack of TNF did not affect peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated rejection of tumor from the peritoneum of preimmunized mice. Overall, these data show that NK cells delivering perforin are the major effectors of class I- tumor rejection in the peritoneum, and that TNF is specifically critical for their recruitment to the peritoneum.","Natural killer cell; Perforin; Recruitment; Tumor; Tumor necrosis factor","CD3 antigen; CD4 antigen; CD8 antigen; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; monoclonal antibody; perforin; tumor necrosis factor alpha; animal cell; article; cell migration; cytotoxicity; major histocompatibility complex; male; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; peritoneum; priority journal; prostate carcinoma; spleen cell; tumor cell; tumor growth; tumor immunology"

Perforin allows granzyme B access to cytosolic and nuclear substrates that, when cleaved, result in the characteristic apoptotic phenotype. Key among these substrates is a family of cytoplasmic caspases that mediate cell suicide. We have examined the caspase dependence of several nuclear and cytoplasmic parameters of apoptosis induced by purified perforin and granzyme B. Cell membrane leakage in response to perforin and granzyme B was independent of caspase activation; however, nuclear events such as DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation and disintegration were abolished by the broad-acting caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk. Despite being spared from nuclear damage, z-VAD-fmk- treated cells exposed to both cytotoxins uniformly died when they were re- cultured, while cells exposed to perforin or granzyme alone survived and proliferated as readily as untreated cells. Pretreatment of cells with z- VAD-fmk also resulted in reduced granzyme B nuclear uptake following addition of perforin; however, its uptake into the cytoplasm in the absence of perforin was unaffected.

The causes of this remarkable interspecific variation are largely unknown, although intraspecific analyses suggest that females seek extra-pair matings to improve the genetic quality of their offspring. If this is a general explanation for the occurrence of extra-pair matings, then proportionally more females should seek to modify the paternity of their clutch when there is more variation among males in their genetic quality. Here we test this prediction in birds and show that interspecific variation in the proportion of extra-pair offspring is positively related to the proportion of polymorphic loci as measured by protein electrophoresis, even when controlling for potentially confounding variables. Genetic variability was also assessed, for sister pairs of species and populations differing significantly in extra-pair paternity, by using random priming, which provides an estimate of genome-wide diversity. We found that genetic diversity was higher in the populations with a higher level of extra-pair paternity.

We have previously shown that perforin specifically induces the redistribution of cytoplasmic grB into the nucleus of dying cells, however a causal role for nuclear targeting of grB in cell death has not been demonstrated. In the present study, we used confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to determine whether the nuclear accumulation of fluoresceinated (FITC-) grB precedes or is a consequence of apoptosis. Two distinct and mutually exclusive cellular responses were observed in FDC-P1 cells: (i) up to 50% of the cells rapidly accumulated FITC grB in the nucleus (maximal at 7 min; t(1/2) of 2 min) and underwent apoptosis; (ii) the remaining cells took up FITC-grB only into the cytoplasm, and escaped apoptosis. Under these conditions, DNA fragmentation was not observed for at least 13 min, indicating nuclear accumulation of grB preceded the execution phase of apoptosis. Furthermore, nuclear import of grB proceeded through an intact nuclear membrane, as the nuclei of cells whose cytoplasm was pre-loaded with 70 kDa FITC-dextran excluded dextran for up to 90 min while still undergoing apoptosis in response to perforin and grB. These findings indicated that perforin-induced nuclear accumulation of grB precedes apoptosis, and is not a by-product of caspase-induced nuclear membrane degradation. The cell membrane lesions formed by perforin in these experiments were not large enough to permit a 13 kDa protein (yeast cdk p13(SUC)) access into the cytoplasm, but an 8 kDa protein (bacterial azurin) was able to equilibrate between the cytosol and the exterior. Therefore, transmembrane pores large enough to allow passive diffusion of grB (32 kDa) into the cell are not necessary for apoptosis. Rather, a perforin-dependent signal results in a redistribution of grB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it may contribute to the nuclear changes associated with apoptosis.","Caspases; Cytolytic lymphocyte; Granzyme; Nuclear localization; Perforin","azurin; cyclin dependent kinase; dextran; dna fragment; fluorescein isothiocyanate; granzyme b; perforin; animal cell; apoptosis; article; cell nucleus; cell nucleus membrane; controlled study; dna cleavage; laser microscopy; membrane transport; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein transport; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Line; Cell Membrane Permeability; Cell Nucleus; Dextrans; DNA Fragmentation; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate; Granzymes; Kinetics; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Microscopy, Confocal; Nuclear Envelope; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins; Serine Endopeptidases; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms)"

Transfected MD45 subclones lysed CEA-positive human colon carcinoma cell lines in an antigen-specific and FasL-dependent manner. The degree of lysis correlated with the level of chimeric receptor expressed on transduced MD45 subclones. The requirement for an intact Y65TGL motif in the signaling γ chain suggested that interaction of the chimeric receptor with target cell CEA induced the cytotoxicity of MD45-scFv subclones. However, MD45 expressing a Y65F mutant chimera still displayed minor levels of lysis following PMA stimulation, suggesting that PMA could bypass γ chain induction of functional FasL. Pretreatment of Fas-resistant CEA-positive colon carcinoma target cells with IFN-γ increased their sensitivity of MD45-scFv subclones and FasL-mediated lysis.

Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed based on sequence motifs selectively expressed in granzymes. These motifs flank ""delta"" regions that are unique for each granzyme. Total RNA of RNK-16 cells or activated splenocytes was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR to obtain cDNA fragments of several new granzymes. Gene-specific primers based on these delta regions were then used for 3′-RACE to obtain clones with the 3′ gene ends. Reverse (antisense) delta-based or active site serine primers were used with a granzyme 5′-UTR primer to obtain clones extending to the 5′ ends. Using this technique, two new cDNAs, RNKP-4 and RNKP-7, which encode granzymes of 248 and 241 amino acids, respectively, were cloned from activated lymphocytes. RNKP-4 is likely the rat equivalent of mouse granzyme C. RNKP-7 is most closely related to granzymes F and G. Modeling of the predicted proteins suggests large/polar P1 (Gln/Asn) specificity for RNKP-4 and large/hydrophobic P1 (e.g., Phe) specificity for RNKP-7.

We have used a mouse perforin 5'-promoter to express a single-chain human Fcε receptor in the mouse cytotoxic T lymphocyte cell line, CTLL-R8. Upon ligation of the chimeric Fcε receptors by IgE, a signal for effector function is transmitted via the intracellular domain of CD3ζ.

Granzymes have features that are strongly conserved including: consensus sequences at their N-termini and around the three catalytic residues, activation from zymogenic forms, and conserved disulphide bridges. However, there is good genetic evidence to suggest that three distinct subfamilies of granzymes have coevolved. These subfamilies are most strikingly depicted by their distinct chromosomal loci and gene organization, dividing the granzyme family into subfamilies of the following: tryptases (human chromosome 5); chymotrypsin-like proteases (human chromosome 14); and a Metase amongst a cluster of elastase-like proteases (human chromosome 19). Modeling and mutational analysis has revealed that each subfamily of granzymes displays special sequence and structural features and a proteolytic specificity determined by subtle modifications to substrate binding pocket residues. It now remains of great interest to determine whether these subfamilies also possess distinct biological functions. Granzyme B has been shown to play an important role in lymphocyte-mediated target cell apoptosis and the tryptase, granzyme A, has been demonstrated to regulate the clearance of some pox virus infections. The future creation of other granzyme gene knockout mice should elucidate whether other chymotrypsin-like granzymes (C-H) also contribute to target cell apoptosis and whether the third subfamily member, natural killer cell-specific Metase, has a distinct biological function.","Apoptosis; Cytotoxic lymphocytes; Gene structure; Perforin; Serpin","granzyme; perforin; serine proteinase inhibitor; unclassified drug; apoptosis; cytotoxic t lymphocyte; gene structure; human; human cell; nonhuman; priority journal; review; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Apoptosis; Consensus Sequence; Cytoplasmic Granules; Evolution, Molecular; Exocytosis; Genes; Humans; Isoenzymes; Killer Cells, Natural; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Rats; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Serine Endopeptidases; Serine Proteinase Inhibitors; Substrate Specificity; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic; pox virus"

It is conventionally accepted that perform acts by perforating the target cell membrane; however, the site and mode of action of granzyme B are unknown. We have addressed this issue using Western blotting, proteolytic assays, and confocal laser scanning microscopy to demonstrate that purified human granzyme B can be taken up in large amounts and bound within nuclei. By contrast, perform and nongranzyme serine proteases did not undergo nuclear uptake. Both unglycosylated human granzyme B (26 kDa) and that bearing high mannose glycosylation (32 kDa) were internalized and bound within nuclei, but forms greater than 32 kDa with complex carbohydrate addition were excluded. The uptake of granzymes was not dependent on net charge, as nuclei absorbed similar quantities of granzyme B at neutral pH and through a range of basic pHs but did not take up other very basic serine proteases such as the mouse mast cell protease 5. Confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated nuclear and nucleolar accumulation of fluoresceinated granzyme B by isolated nuclei. Measurement of the kinetics of nuclear import using an in vitro nuclear transport assay indicated maximal levels of nuclear accumulation of granzyme about 2.5-fold above those in the cytoplasm and nucleolar accumulation a further 3-4-fold higher. Nuclear and nucleolar accumulation were exceedingly rapid, reaching half-maximal levels within 3.3 and 7.5 min, respectively, implying that nuclear accumulation probably occurs prior to transport to the nucleolus.

Molecular biology has dominated the recent study of cytotoxic lymphocyte function, allowing the characterisation of recognition structures on cytotoxic lymphocytes, the definition of two distinct mechanisms of cytotoxicity and the determination of their relevance in vivo. Biological and genetic experimental approaches which exploit the targeted cytolytic activity of lymphocytes are now being developed for immunotherapy. A greater knowledge of the biology of cytotoxic lymphocytes when adoptively transferred, the development of engineered monoclonal antibodies and the characterisation of novel endogenous tumour cell antigens, has us on the brink of using these cells to greater therapeutic advantage.

To characterize the genomic sequences responsible for the CD3- LGL-restricted expression of this gene, we screened a rat genomic library with RNK-Met-1 cDNA, and obtained bacteriophage clones that contained the RNK-Met-1 gene. The RNK-Met-1 gene comprises 5 exons and spans approximately 5.2 kilobases (kb), exhibiting a similar structural organization to a class of CTL-serine proteases with protease catalytic residues encoded near the borders of exons 2, 3, and 5. The 5′-flanking region of the RNK-Met-1 gene contains a number of putative promoter and enhancer regulatory elements and shares several regions of homology with the 5′-flanking region of the mouse perforin gene. We have prepared nested deletions from approximately 3.3 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the RNK-Met-1 gene, and inserted these upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. These 5′-flanking RNK-Met-1-CAT constructs were transiently transfected into rat LGL leukemia, T-lymphoma, and basophilic leukemia cell lines. © 1995, Springer-Verlag.

Utilizing molecular sieve chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC, we purified RNK-Tryp-2 to homogeneity and sequenced 33 NH2-terminal amino acids. Oligonucleotide primers were used in the PCR to generate a 528-bp cDNA clone encoding a novel serine protease from RNK-16 mRNA. This cDNA clone was used to isolate an 884-bp RNK-Tryp-2 cDNA from an RNK-16 λ-gt11 library. The open reading frame predicts a mature protein of 233 amino acids which does not have potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. The cDNA encodes a leader peptide of at least 25 amino acids. The characteristic Ile-Ile-Gly-Gly amino acids of the N-terminus, and the His, Asp, and Ser amino acids that form the catalytic triad of serine proteases, are conserved. The amino acid sequence has less than 45% identity with any other member of the serine protease family, indicating that RNK- Tryp-2 is distinct protease. Southern blot analysis suggests the existence of one or more related genes. A single 1.3-kb mRNA transcript was detected by Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA from the in vivo passaged RNK- 16, rat splenocytes, lung and liver nonparenchymal cells, as well as in highly purified rat LGL and T cells. RNK-Tryp-2 is a novel serine protease that is expressed in the granules of large granular lymphocytes.",,"complementary dna; serine proteinase; amino acid sequence; amino terminal sequence; animal cell; animal experiment; article; enzyme purification; large granular lymphocyte; leukemia cell line; molecular cloning; nonhuman; open reading frame; priority journal; rat; sequence homology; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Chymases; Cloning, Molecular; Cytoplasmic Granules; DNA Primers; DNA, Complementary; Gene Expression; Killer Cells, Natural; Leukemia, Experimental; Molecular Sequence Data; Rats; RNA, Messenger; Serine Endopeptidases; Tryptases; Tumor Cells, Cultured"
"TRAPANI J.A., SMYTH M.J.","Theoretical Article Killing by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells: Multiple granule serine proteases as initiators of DNA fragmentation","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027318806&doi=10.1111%2fj.1440-1711.1993.tb03404.x&partnerID=40&md5=152f230e5fbb12fbc5bbe8e08aa9e8de","The vectorial secretion of the contents of highly specialized cytoplasmic granules is of pivotal importance to the killing by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells. The purification and biochemical characterization of some of the granule constituents, in particular the pore‐forming protein perforin, had engendered the notion that the killing of cellular targets was largely an osmotic phenomenon analogous to the insult delivered by complement attack. However, the apparent absence of membrane perforation in various examples of lymphocyte‐mediated killing, and the observation that perforation alone could not account for apoptosis associated with programmed cell death, suggested that perforin activity represented, at best, only a part of the whole mechanism. More recently, the characterization of a large family of granule serine proteases (granzymes) has provided evidence that these molecules may collaborate in the killing process by inducing a ‘suicide’ pathway in target cells, resulting in DNA fragmentation. However, the serine proteases are inactive alone, their natural substrates have not been defined and they require access into the target cell cytoplasm via perforin‐induced pores to exert their deleterious effects. Thus, we propose that the cytotoxic granule‐mediated mechanism comprises at least two interdependent arms, perforin and serine proteases, that together are capable of inflicting cell death by osmotic shock and/or nuclear collapse.

Cells of this line exhibit a fibroblastlike appearance and grew optimal at 25°C in, TC-199 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, but slower growth continued down to 4°C, where they could be stored for prolonged periods. Seeding efficiency of ULF-23HU cells on the plastic substratum was approximately 85% in the above culture medium at 25°C. They had a 32-h cell cycle time taken up by a 20-h S period as determined by the autoradiographic analysis of the fraction of labeled mitosis. Cultures showed relatively high mitotic index (0.84 to 2.35%) during exponential growth phase lasting about 7 d. Karyological analysis of the cells at the different subculture passages revealed constant chromosome modal number of 23 consisting of metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes, which were primarily similar to those of in vivo cells, with one additional chromosome. The spontaneous sister chromatid exchange rate was 5.3 per metaphse. When ULF-23HU cells were exposed to N-nitroso-N-methylurea, a clastogen in the mammalian cells, dose-dependent increases both in sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations were clearly detected. These results on the growth kinetics and cytogenetic characteristics offered the high possibility of the use of this cell line as a suitable in vitro model for clastogenicity studies in fish. © 1989 Tissue Culture Association, Inc.","chromosome; clastogenicity assay; growth kinetics; Umbra limi cell line","radioisotope; animal cell; article; autoradiography; cell culture; chromosome; clastogenicity; cytogenesis; fish; nonhuman; priority journal; Animalia; Bovinae; Mammalia; Umbra limi"
