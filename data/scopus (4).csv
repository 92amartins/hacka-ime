It is one of the most widely spread cancer among women. As per the survey, one out of eight women in the world are at risk of breast cancer at some point of time in her life. One of the methods to reduce breast cancer mortality rate is timely detection and effective treatment. That is why, more accurate classification of a breast cancer tumor has become a challenging problem in the medical field. Many classification techniques are proposed in the literature. Today, expert systems and machine learning techniques are being extensively used in the breast cancer classification problem. They provide high classification accuracy and effective diagnostic capabilities. In this paper, we have proposed a novel Gauss-Newton representation based algorithm (GNRBA) for breast cancer classification. It uses the sparse representation with training sample selection. Until now, sparse representation has been successfully applied in pattern recognition only. The proposed method introduces a novel Gauss-Newton based approach to find the optimal weights for the training samples for classification. In addition, it evaluates the sparsity in a computationally efficient way as compared to the conventional l1-norm method. The effectiveness of the GNRBA is examined on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database (WBCD) and the Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer (WDBC) database from the UCI Machine Learning repository. Various performance measures like classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrices, a statistical test and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) are reported to show the superiority of the proposed method as compared to classical models. The experimental results show that the proposed GNRBA could be a good alternative for breast cancer classification for clinical experts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Breast cancer classification; Euclidean distance measure; Gauss-Newton representation based algorithm; Sparse representation","Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Expert systems; Gaussian distribution; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Sampling; Breast cancer classifications; Euclidean distance measure; Gauss Newton; Gauss-Newton based approach; Machine learning techniques; Receiver operating characteristics; Sparse representation; UCI machine learning repository; Diseases"

We present a novel benefit of voting, that has not been observed before: we can use the voting patterns to assess the performance of a team and predict their final outcome. This prediction can be executed at any moment during problem-solving and it is completely domain independent. Hence, it can be used to identify when a team is failing, allowing an operator to take remedial procedures (such as changing team members, the voting rule, or increasing the allocation of resources). We present three main theoretical results: (1) we show a theoretical explanation of why our prediction method works; (2) contrary to what would be expected based on a simpler explanation using classical voting models, we show that we can make accurate predictions irrespective of the strength (i.e., performance) of the teams, and that in fact, the prediction can work better for diverse teams composed of different agents than uniform teams made of copies of the best agent; (3) we show that the quality of our prediction increases with the size of the action space. We perform extensive experimentation in two different domains: Computer Go and Ensemble Learning. In Computer Go, we obtain high quality predictions about the final outcome of games. We analyze the prediction accuracy for three different teams with different levels of diversity and strength, and show that the prediction works significantly better for a diverse team. Additionally, we show that our method still works well when trained with games against one adversary, but tested with games against another, showing the generality of the learned functions. Moreover, we evaluate four different board sizes, and experimentally confirm better predictions in larger board sizes. We analyze in detail the learned prediction functions, and how they change according to each team and action space size. In order to show that our method is domain independent, we also present results in Ensemble Learning, where we make online predictions about the performance of a team of classifiers, while they are voting to classify sets of items. We study a set of classical classification algorithms from machine learning, in a data-set of hand-written digits, and we are able to make high-quality predictions about the final performance of two different teams. Since our approach is domain independent, it can be easily applied to a variety of other domains. © 2016, The Author(s).","Collective intelligence; Distributed problem solving; Single and multiagent learning; Social choice theory; Teamwork","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computer games; Forecasting; Learning systems; Multi agent systems; Collective intelligences; Distributed problem solving; Multi-agent learning; Social choice theory; Teamwork; Problem solving"

Of various machine-learning techniques, sparse regression models have proved their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data but with a small number of training samples, especially in medical problems. In the meantime, deep learning methods have been making great successes by outperforming the state-of-the-art performances in various applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines the two conceptually different methods of sparse regression and deep learning for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment diagnosis and prognosis. Specifically, we first train multiple sparse regression models, each of which is trained with different values of a regularization control parameter. Thus, our multiple sparse regression models potentially select different feature subsets from the original feature set; thereby they have different powers to predict the response values, i.e., clinical label and clinical scores in our work. By regarding the response values from our sparse regression models as target-level representations, we then build a deep convolutional neural network for clinical decision making, which thus we call ‘Deep Ensemble Sparse Regression Network.’ To our best knowledge, this is the first work that combines sparse regression models with deep neural network. In our experiments with the ADNI cohort, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving the highest diagnostic accuracies in three classification tasks. We also rigorously analyzed our results and compared with the previous studies on the ADNI cohort in the literature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alzheimer's disease; Convolutional neural network; Deep ensemble learning; Sparse regression model","Artificial intelligence; Brain mapping; Clustering algorithms; Computer aided analysis; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer aided instruction; Convolution; Data handling; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical problems; Neural networks; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neuroimaging; Regression analysis; Alzheimer's disease; Clinical decision making; Convolutional neural network; Diagnosis and prognosis; Ensemble learning; Machine learning techniques; Sparse regression; State-of-the-art performance; Deep learning; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain disease; clinical decision making; clinical effectiveness; deep ensemble learning; female; human; learning algorithm; major clinical study; male; mathematical computing; mild cognitive impairment; nerve cell network; predictive value; priority journal; prognosis; regression analysis; scoring system; sparse regression model"

We proposed a multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP) for creating a heterogeneous flexible neural tree (HFNT), tree-like flexible feedforward neural network model. The functional heterogeneity in neural tree nodes was introduced to capture a better insight of data during learning because each input in a dataset possess different features. MOGP guided an initial HFNT population towards Pareto-optimal solutions, where the final population was used for making an ensemble system. A diversity index measure along with approximation error and complexity was introduced to maintain diversity among the candidates in the population. Hence, the ensemble was created by using accurate, structurally simple, and diverse candidates from MOGP final population. Differential evolution algorithm was applied to fine-tune the underlying parameters of the selected candidates. A comprehensive test over classification, regression, and time-series datasets proved the efficiency of the proposed algorithm over other available prediction methods. Moreover, the heterogeneous creation of HFNT proved to be efficient in making ensemble system from the final population. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Approximation; Ensemble; Feature selection; Flexible neural tree; Pareto-based multiobjectives","Approximation algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Complex networks; Evolutionary algorithms; Feature extraction; Feedforward neural networks; Forestry; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Pareto principle; Approximation; Differential evolution algorithms; Ensemble; Flexible neural trees; Functional heterogeneity; Multi objective; Multiobjective genetic programming; Pareto optimal solutions; Trees (mathematics)"

It is first shown that, at the static level, desires should satisfy certain principles that differ from those to which beliefs obey. In this sense, from a static perspective, the logic of desires is different from the logic of beliefs. While the accumulation of beliefs tend to reduce the remaining possible worlds they point at, the accumulation of desires tends to increase the set of states of affairs tentatively considered as satisfactory. Indeed beliefs are expected to be closed under conjunctions, while, in the positive view of desires developed here, one can argue that endorsing φ∨ ψ as a desire means to desire φ and to desire ψ. However, desiring φ and ¬ φ at the same time is not usually regarded as rational, since it does not make much sense to desire one thing and its contrary at the same time. Thus when a new desire is added to the set of desires of an agent, a revision process may be necessary. Just as belief revision relies on an epistemic entrenchment relation, desire revision is based on a hedonic entrenchment relation satisfying other properties, due to the different natures of belief and desire. While epistemic entrenchment relations are known to be qualitative necessity relations (in the sense of possibility theory), hedonic relations obeying a set of reasonable postulates correspond to another set-function in possibility theory, called guaranteed possibility, that drive well-behaved desire revision operations. Then the general framework of possibilistic logic provides a syntactic setting for encoding desire change. The paper also insists that desires should be carefully distinguished from goals. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Desire; Possibility theory; Revision","Artificial intelligence; Philosophical aspects; Belief revision; Desire; Formal approach; Logical approaches; Other properties; Possibilistic logic; Possibility theory; Revision; Computer circuits"

Indeed, pesticide degradation in soil may be influenced by either biotic or abiotic factors. In addition, the toxicity of pesticides for living organisms depends on their adsorption, distribution, biotransformation, dissemination of metabolites together with interaction with cellular macromolecules and excretion. Biotransformation may result in the formation of less toxic and/or more toxic metabolites, while other processes determine the balance between toxic and a nontoxic upcoming. Aggregate exposure and risk assessment involve multiple pathways and routes, including the potential for pesticide residues in food and drinking water, in addition to residues from pesticide use in residential and non-occupational environments.

In recent times, a number of artificial intelligence scheduling techniques are applied to reduced task execution delay. These techniques have contributed toward the need for an ideal solution. The objective of this study is to optimize task scheduling based on proposed orthogonal Taguchi-based cat swarm optimization (OTB-CSO) in order to reduce total task execution delay. In our proposed algorithm, Taguchi orthogonal approach was incorporated into tracing mode of CSO to scheduled tasks on VMs with minimum execution time. CloudSim tool was used to implement the proposed algorithm where the impact of the algorithm was checked with 5, 10 and 20 VMs besides input tasks and evaluated based on makespan and degree of imbalance metrics. Experimental results showed that for 20 VMs used, our proposed OTB-CSO was able to minimize makespan of the total tasks scheduled across VMs with 42.86, 34.57 and 2.58% improvement over minimum and maximum job first (Min–Max), particle swarm optimization with linear descending inertia weight (PSO-LDIW) and hybrid PSO with simulated annealing (HPSO-SA) and likewise returned degree of imbalance with 70.03, 62.83 and 35.68% improvement over existing algorithms.

Teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is a recent metaheuristic, which is inspired through the teaching and learning process of both teacher and learner. As compared to other algorithms, it is efficient and robust due to its non-controlling parameter adjustments feature. Elitist TLBO is an improved version of TLBO with the addition of elitist solutions, which makes it more efficient. During the experiment, first the TLBO and then ETLBO algorithm are applied with only Pi-sigma neural network and its performance has been compared with other methods such as GA and PSO. Then, the ETLBO algorithm is applied with JPSNN and found better results over other methods. The proposed method has been tested with real-world benchmark datasets considered from UCI machine learning repository, and the performance has been compared with all seven approaches along with other HONN to prove the effectiveness of the method.

VPPs are formed via the aggregation of a large number of DERs, so that they exhibit the characteristics of a traditional generator in terms of predictability and robustness. In this work, we promote the formation of such “cooperative” VPPs (CVPPs) using techniques from the field of distributed Artificial Intelligence and game theory. In particular, we design a payment mechanism that encourages DERs to join CVPPs with increased size and visibility to the network operator. Our method is based on strictly proper scoring rules and incentivises the provision of accurate predictions of expected electricity generation from member DERs, which aids in the planning of the supply schedule at the Grid. We empirically evaluate our approach using the real-world setting of 16 commercial wind farms in the UK, and we show that it incentivises real DERs to form CVPPs, and outperforms the current state of the art payment mechanism developed for this problem. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Coalition formation; Cooperative virtual power plants; Game theory; Multi-agent systems; Scoring rules","Artificial intelligence; Energy resources; Game theory; Intelligent agents; Multi agent systems; Small power plants; Wind power; Coalition formations; Distributed Artificial Intelligence; Distributed Energy Resources; Electricity generation; Electricity supply network; Proper scoring rules; Scoring rules; Virtual power plants; Electric power transmission networks; artificial intelligence; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy planning; energy resource; game theory; power plant; solar power; wind farm"

FNT resembles feedforward neural network, which creates a tree-like structure by using genetic programming. To improve accuracy, FNT parameters were optimized by using differential evolution algorithm. The performance of the FNT-based CI model was evaluated and compared with other CI techniques: multilayer perceptron, Gaussian process regression, and reduced error pruning tree. The accuracy of the CI model was evaluated experimentally using die filling as a case study. The die filling experiments were performed using a model shoe system and three different grades of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) powders (MCC PH 101, MCC PH 102, and MCC DG). The feed powders were roll-compacted and milled into granules. The granules were then sieved into samples of various size classes. The mass of granules deposited into the die at different shoe speeds was measured. From these experiments, a dataset consisting true density, mean diameter (d50), granule size, and shoe speed as the inputs and the deposited mass as the output was generated. Cross-validation (CV) methods such as 10FCV and 5x2FCV were applied to develop and to validate the predictive models. It was found that the FNT-based CI model (for both CV methods) performed much better than other CI models. Additionally, it was observed that process variables such as the granule size and the shoe speed had a higher impact on the predictability than that of the powder property such as d50. Furthermore, validation of model prediction with experimental data showed that the die filling behavior of coarse granules could be better predicted than that of fine granules. © 2016 The Natural Computing Applications Forum","Die filling; Feature selection; Flexible neural tree; Flowability; Pharmaceutical granules; Predictive modeling","Artificial intelligence; Cellulose; Dies; Evolutionary algorithms; Feature extraction; Feedforward neural networks; Filling; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Optimization; Powders; Die filling; Flexible neural trees; Flowability; Pharmaceutical granules; Predictive modeling; Granulation"

The efficacy of radiation treatment highly depends on segmentation accuracy. However, accurate segmentation of male pelvic organs is challenging due to low tissue contrast of CT images, as well as large variations of shape and appearance of the pelvic organs. Among existing segmentation methods, deformable models are the most popular, as shape prior can be easily incorporated to regularize the segmentation. Nonetheless, the sensitivity to initialization often limits their performance, especially for segmenting organs with large shape variations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to guide deformable models, thus making them robust against arbitrary initializations. Specifically, we learn a displacement regressor, which predicts 3D displacement from any image voxel to the target organ boundary based on the local patch appearance. This regressor provides a non-local external force for each vertex of deformable model, thus overcoming the initialization problem suffered by the traditional deformable models. To learn a reliable displacement regressor, two strategies are particularly proposed. 1) A multi-task random forest is proposed to learn the displacement regressor jointly with the organ classifier; 2) an auto-context model is used to iteratively enforce structural information during voxel-wise prediction. Extensive experiments on 313 planning CT scans of 313 patients show that our method achieves better results than alternative classification or regression based methods, and also several other existing methods in CT pelvic organ segmentation. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","computed tomography; deformable model; Image segmentation; machine learning; pelvic organs; prostate cancer; random forest","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Deformation; Diseases; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Radiotherapy; Sensitivity analysis; Urology; Deformable modeling; Initialization Problem; pelvic organs; Prostate cancers; Random forests; Segmentation accuracy; Segmentation methods; Structural information; Computerized tomography; Article; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; computer assisted tomography; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; pelvis; prostate cancer; random forest; treatment planning; artificial neural network; bladder; computer assisted diagnosis; decision tree; diagnostic imaging; machine learning; pelvis; procedures; prostate; prostate tumor; rectum; x-ray computed tomography; Decision Trees; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Male; Neural Networks (Computer); Pelvis; Prostate; Prostatic Neoplasms; Rectum; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Urinary Bladder"

Many nonproft agencies conduct interventions to educate and train a select group of homeless youth about HIV prevention and treatment practices and rely on word-of-mouth spread of information through their one single social network Previous work in strategic selection of intervention participants does not handle uncertainties in the social networks' structure and evolving network state, potentially causing significant shortcomings in spread of information. Thus, we developed PSINET, a decision-support system to aid the agencies in this task. PSINET includes the following key novelties: (1) it handles uncertainties in network structure and evolving network state; (2) it addresses these uncertainties by using POMDPs in influence maximization; and (3) it provides algorithmic advances to allow high-quality approximate solutions for such POMDPs. Simulations show that PSINET achieves around 60 percent more information spread over the current state of the art.

To circumvent this problem, feature selection and subspace learning have been playing core roles in the literature. Generally, feature selection methods are preferable in clinical applications due to their ease for interpretation, but subspace learning methods can usually achieve more promising results. In this paper, we combine two different methodological approaches to discriminative feature selection in a unified framework. Specifically, we utilize two subspace learning methods, namely, linear discriminant analysis and locality preserving projection, which have proven their effectiveness in a variety of fields, to select class-discriminative and noise-resistant features. Unlike previous methods in neuroimaging studies that mostly focused on a binary classification, the proposed feature selection method is further applicable for multiclass classification in AD diagnosis.

To add to the woe, it is tedious to adjust the set of weights of ANNs by using appropriate learning algorithm to obtain better classification accuracy. In this paper, an improved variant of harmony search (HS), called self-adaptive harmony search (SAHS) along with gradient descent learning is used with functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) for the task of classification in data mining. Using its past experiences, SAHS adjusts the harmonies according to the maximum and minimum values in the current harmony memory. The powerful combination of this unique strategy of SAHS and searching capabilities of gradient descent search is used to obtain optimal set of weights for FLANN. The proposed method (SAHS-FLANN) is implemented in MATLAB and the results are contrasted with other alternatives (FLANN, GA based FLANN, PSO based FLANN, HS based FLANN, improved HS based FLANN and TLBO based FLANN). To illustrate its effectiveness, SAHS-FLANN is tested on various benchmark datasets from UCI machine learning repository by using 5-fold cross validation technique. Under the null-hypothesis, the proposed method is analyzed by using various statistical tests for statistical correctness of results. The performance of the SAHS-FLANN is found to be better and statistically significant in comparison with other alternatives. The SAHS-FLANN differs from HS-FLANN (HS based FLANN) by the elimination of constant parameters (bandwidth and pitch adjustment rate). Furthermore, it leads to the simplification of steps for the improvisation of weight-sets in IHS-FLANN (improved HS based FLANN) by incorporating adjustments of new weight-sets according to the weight-sets with maximum and minimum fitness. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Data mining; Functional link artificial neural network; Gradient descent learning; Machine intelligence; Self adaptive harmony search","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Optimization; Statistical tests; Classification accuracy; Cross-validation technique; Functional link artificial neural networks; Gradient descent; Machine intelligence; Searching capability; Self adaptive harmony searches; UCI machine learning repository; Classification (of information); Article; artificial neural network; controlled study; data mining; functional link artificial neural network; gradient descent learning; learning algorithm; memory consideration probability; priority journal; probability; process optimization; random probability; self adaptive harmony search; validation process"

This motivates an approach for revising desires, a topic remained largely untouched. Desires do not behave as beliefs. While beliefs are closed under conjunction, one may argue that the disjunction of desires reflects the endorsement of each desire. In a possibility theory modeling setting, desires are expressed by a strong possibility set function, while beliefs are encoded by means of a necessity function.

Subsequent research has worked on the significant evolution of PAWS, from an emerging application to a regularly deployed software. A key advance of the deployed version of PAWS is that it incorporates the complex terrain information and generates a strategy consisting of easy-to-follow routes.

We model the problem of maintenance performance, assuming maintenance is time consuming. We solve the optimal policy for the user, i.e., the optimal timing for a user to perform maintenance. This optimal strategy depends on the value of user's time, and thus it may vary from user to user and may change over time. Based on the solved optimal strategy we present a personalized maintenance agent, which, depending on the value of user's time, provides alerts to the user when she should perform maintenance.

However, current large-scale environmental participatory sensing campaigns typically do not coordinate the measurements of participants, which can lead to gaps or redundancy in the collected data. While some work has considered this problem, it has made several unrealistic assumptions. In particular, it assumes that complete and accurate knowledge about the participants future movements is available and it does not consider constraints on the number of measurements a user is willing to take. To address these shortcomings, we develop a computationally-efficient coordination algorithm (Bestmatch) to suggest to users where and when to take measurements. Our algorithm exploits human mobility patterns, but explicitly considers the inherent uncertainty of these patterns.We empirically evaluate our algorithm on a real-world human mobility and air quality dataset and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art greedy and pull-based proximity algorithms in dynamic environments. © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

In order to save wildlife in designated wildlife parks, park rangers conduct patrols over the park area to combat such illegal activities. An important aspect of the patrolling activity of the rangers is to anticipate where the poachers are likely to catch animals and then respond accordingly. Previous work has applied defender-attacker Stackel-berg Security Games (SSGs) to solve the problem of wildlife protection, wherein attacker behavioral models are used to predict the behaviors of the poachers. However, these behavioral models have several limitations which limit their accuracy in predicting poachers' behavior. First, existing models fail to account for the rangers' imperfect observations w.r.t poaching activities (due to the limited capability of rangers to patrol thoroughly over a vast geographical area). Second, these models are built upon discrete choice models that assume a single agent choosing targets, while it is infeasible to obtain information about every single attacker in wildlife protection. Third, these models do not consider the etfect of past poachers' actions on the current poachers' activities, one of the key factors affecting the poachers' behaviors. In this work, we attempt to address these limitations while providing three main contributions. First, we propose a novel hierarchical behavioral model, HiBRID, to predict the poachers' behaviors wherein the rangers' imperfect detection of poaching signs is taken into account - a significant advance towards existing behavioral models in security games. Furthermore, HiBRID incorporates the temporal effect on the poachers' behaviors. The model also does not require a known number of attackers. Second, we provide two new heuristics: parameter separation and target abstraction to reduce the computational complexity in learning the model parameters. Finally, we use the real-world data collected in Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP) in Uganda over 12 years to evaluate the prediction accuracy of our new model.

First of all,gray matter and white matter tissue volumes in brain regions of interest are extracted as two feature vectors. Then,a small group of significant features were selected using the iterative structure of our proposed ICCA framework from both feature vectors. Finally,the selected features are used to build a robust classifier for automatic diagnosis of PD. Experimental results show that the proposed feature selection method results in better diagnosis accuracy,compared to the baseline and state-of-the-art methods. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Artificial intelligence; Brain; Correlation methods; Diagnosis; Feature extraction; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neuroimaging; Alternative solutions; Canonical correlation analysis; Feature selection methods; Machine learning methods; Neurodegenerative disorders; Neuroimaging techniques; State-of-the-art methods; White matter tissues; Computer aided diagnosis"

In this paper, we propose an automatic learning-based hippocampal subfields segmentation framework using multi-modality 3TMR images, including T1 MRI and restingstate fMRI (rs-fMRI). To do this, we first acquire both 3T and 7T T1 MRIs for each training subject, and then the 7T T1 MRI are linearly registered onto the 3T T1 MRI. Six hippocampal subfields are manually labeled on the aligned 7T T1 MRI, which has the 7T image contrast but sits in the 3T T1 space. Next, corresponding appearance and relationship features from both 3T T1 MRI and rs-fMRI are extracted to train a structured random forest as a multi-label classifier to conduct the segmentation. Finally, the subfield segmentation is further refined iteratively by additional context features and updated relationship features. To our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the challenging automatic hippocampal subfields segmentation using 3T routine T1 MRI and rs-fMRI. The quantitative comparison between our results and manual ground truth demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Besides, we also find that (a) multi-modality features significantly improved subfield segmentation performance due to the complementary information among modalities; (b) automatic segmentation results using 3T multimodality images are partially comparable to those on 7T T1 MRI. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computer aided instruction; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Automatic segmentations; Automatic-learning; Multi modality image; Multi-modality images; Neurological disease; Quantitative comparison; Resting-state fmri; Segmentation performance; Image segmentation"

In this paper, we analyze TH equilibria of Plurality voting. We provide an efficient algorithm for computing a TH best response and establish many useful properties of TH equilibria in Plurality voting games.

In the present work, a characterization of discrete Choquet integrals with respect to a possibility or a necessity measure is proposed, understood as a criterion for decision under uncertainty. This kind of criterion has the merit of being very simple to define and compute. To get our characterization, it is shown that it is enough to respectively add an optimism or a pessimism axiom to the axioms of the Choquet integral with respect to a general capacity. This additional axiom enforces the maxitivity or the minitivity of the capacity and essentially assumes that the decisionmaker preferences only reflect the plausibility ordering between states of nature. The obtained pessimistic (resp. optimistic) criterion is an average of the maximin (resp. maximax) criterion of Wald across cuts of a possibility distribution on the state space. The additional axiom can be also used in the axiomatic approach to Sugeno integral and generalized forms thereof.

In particular, the tissue segmentation of white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is crucial for brain measurement and disease diagnosis. A variety of studies have shown that the learning-based techniques are efficient and effective in brain tissue segmentation. However, the learning-based segmentation methods depend largely on the availability of good training labels. The commonly used 3T magnetic resonance (MR) images have insufficient image quality and often exhibit poor intensity contrast between WM, GM, and CSF, therefore not able to provide good training labels for learning-based methods. The advances in ultra-high field 7T imaging make it possible to acquire images with an increasingly high level of quality. In this study, we propose an algorithm based on random forest for segmenting 3T MR images by introducing the segmentation information from their corresponding 7T MR images (through semi-automatic labeling). Furthermore, our algorithm iteratively refines the probability maps of WM, GM, and CSF via a cascade of random forest classifiers to improve the tissue segmentation.

As only certain brain regions are related to AD progression, many feature selection methods have been proposed to identify informative features (i.e., brain regions) to build an accurate prediction model. These methods mostly only focus on the feature-target relationship to select features which are discriminative to the targets (e.g., diagnosis labels). However, since the brain regions are anatomically and functionally connected, there could be useful intrinsic relationships among features. In this paper, by utilizing both the feature-target and feature-feature relationships, we propose a novel sparse regression model to select informative features which are discriminative to the targets and also representative to the features. We argue that the features which are representative (i.e., can be used to represent many other features) are important, as they signify strong “connection” with other ROIs, and could be related to the disease progression. We use our model to select features for both binary and multi-class classification tasks, and the experimental results on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset show that the proposed method outperforms other comparison methods considered in this work. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Artificial intelligence; Brain; Classification (of information); Computer aided instruction; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Neuroimaging; Regression analysis; Accurate prediction; Brain regions; Comparison methods; Disease diagnosis; Disease progression; Feature selection methods; Multi-class classification; Sparse regression; Feature extraction"

The approach uses non-instantiated possibility weights to define conditional preference tables. Moreover, additional information about the relative strengths of these symbolic weights can be taken into account. The fact that at best we have some information about the relative values of these weights acknowledges the qualitative nature of preference specification. These conditional preference tables give birth to vectors of symbolic weights that reflect the preferences that are satisfied and those that are violated in a considered situation. The comparison of such vectors may rely on different orderings: the ones induced by the product-based, or the minimum-based chain rule underlying the possibilistic network, the discrimin, or leximin refinements of the minimum-based ordering, as well as Pareto ordering, and the symmetric Pareto ordering that refines it. A thorough study of the relations between these orderings in presence of vector components that are symbolic rather numerical is presented. In particular, we establish that the product-based ordering and the symmetric Pareto ordering coincide in presence of constraints comparing pairs of symbolic weights. This ordering agrees in the Boolean case with the inclusion between the sets of preference statements that are violated. The symmetric Pareto ordering may be itself refined by the leximin ordering.

Previous studies showed network breakdown in MCI patients with thresholded rs-fMRI connectivity networks. Recently, machine learning techniques have assisted MCI diagnosis by integrating information from multiple networks constructed with a range of thresholds. However, due to the difficulty of searching optimal thresholds, they are often predetermined and uniformly applied to the entire network. Here, we propose an element-wise thresholding strategy to dynamically construct multiple functional networks, i.e., using possibly different thresholds for different elements in the connectivity matrix. These dynamically generated networks are then integrated with a network fusion scheme to capture their common and complementary information. Finally, the features extracted from the fused network are fed into support vector machine (SVM) for MCI diagnosis.

However, the characteristics of such longitudinal images and how they lodge into the image manifold are often neglected in existing labeling methods. Indeed, most of them independently align atlases to each target time-point image for propagating the pre-defined atlas labels to the subject domain. In this paper, we present a dual-layer groupwise registration method to consistently label anatomical regions of interest in brain images across different time-points using a multi-atlases-based labeling framework. Our framework can best enhance the labeling of longitudinal images through: (1) using the group mean of the longitudinal images of each subject (i.e., subject-mean) as a bridge between atlases and the longitudinal subject scans to align atlases to all time-point images jointly; and (2) using inter-atlas relationship in their nesting manifold to better register each atlas image to the subject-mean. These steps yield to a more consistent (from the joint alignment of atlases with all time-point images) and more accurate (from the manifold-guided registration between each atlases and the subject-mean image) registration, thereby eventually improving the consistency and accuracy for the subsequent labeling step. We have tested our dual-layer groupwise registration method to label two challenging longitudinal brain datasets (i.e., healthy infants and Alzheimer’s disease subjects). Our experimental results have showed that our method achieves higher labeling accuracy while keeping the labeling consistency over time, when compared to the traditional registration scheme (without our proposed contributions). Moreover, the proposed framework can flexibly integrate with the existing label fusion methods, such as sparse-patch based methods, to improve the labeling accuracy of longitudinal datasets. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Artificial intelligence; Brain mapping; Computer aided instruction; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Anatomical labeling; Anatomical regions; Labeling accuracies; Longitudinal registrations; Patch-based methods; Registration methods; Registration scheme; Temporal consistency; Image processing"

However, very few registration methods can work universally well for infant brain images at arbitrary development stages from birth to one year old, mainly due to (1) large anatomical variations and (2) dynamic appearance changes. In this paper, we propose a novel learningbased registration method to not only align the anatomical structures but also estimate the appearance difference between two infant MR images with possible large age gap. To achieve this goal, we leverage the random forest regression and auto-context model to learn the evolution of shape and appearance from a set of longitudinal infant images (with subject-specific temporal correspondences well determined) and then predict both the deformation pathway and appearance change between two new infant subjects. After that, it becomes much easier to deploy any conventional image registration method to complete the remaining registration since the above challenges for current state-of-the-art registration methods have been solved successfully.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that utilizes sparse regression models as target-level representation learner and builds a deep convolutional neural network for clinical decision making. Specifically, we first train multiple sparse regression models, each of which has different values of a regularization control parameter, and use the outputs of the trained regression models as target-level representations. Note that sparse regression models trained with different values of a regularization control parameter potentially select different sets of features from the original ones, thereby they have different powers to predict the response values, i.e., a clinical label and clinical scores in our work. We then construct a deep convolutional neural network by taking the target-level representations as input. Our deep network learns to optimally fuse the predicted response variables, i.e., target-level representations, from the same sparse response model(s) and also those from the neighboring sparse response models. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that systematically integrates sparse regression models with deep neural network. In our experiments with ADNI cohort, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving the highest classification accuracies in three different tasks of Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment identification. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Convolution; Data handling; Decision making; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Neuroimaging; Classification accuracy; Clinical decision making; Control parameters; Convolutional neural network; Deep neural networks; High dimensional data; Mild cognitive impairments; Number of samples; Regression analysis"

To help optimize treatment strategy,accurate preoperative prediction of HGG patient’s outcome (i.e.,survival time) is of great clinical value. However,there are huge individual variability of HGG,which produces a large variation in survival time,thus making prognostic prediction more challenging. Previous brain imaging-based outcome prediction studies relied only on the imaging intensity inside or slightly around the tumor,while ignoring any information that is located far away from the lesion (i.e.,the “normal appearing” brain tissue). Notably,in addition to altering MR image intensity,we hypothesize that the HGG growth and its mass effect also change both structural (can be modeled by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)) and functional brain connectivities (estimated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)). Therefore,integrating connectomics information in outcome prediction could improve prediction accuracy. To this end,we unprecedentedly devise a machine learning-based HGG prediction framework that can effectively extract valuable features from complex human brain connectome using network analysis tools,followed by a novel multi-stage feature selection strategy to single out good features while reducing feature redundancy. Ultimately,we use support vector machine (SVM) to classify HGG outcome as either bad (survival time >650 days) or good (survival time ≤650 days). Our method achieved 75 % prediction accuracy. We also found that functional and structural networks provide complementary information for the outcome prediction,thus leading to increased prediction accuracy compared with the baseline method,which only uses the basic clinical information (63.2 %). © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Artificial intelligence; Brain; Brain mapping; Complex networks; Diagnosis; Diffusion tensor imaging; Forecasting; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Neuroimaging; Patient treatment; Support vector machines; Tensors; Tumors; Brain connectivity; Clinical information; Feature redundancy; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; High-grade gliomata; Individual variability; Prediction accuracy; Structural networks; Functional neuroimaging"

Different from conventional deformable segmentation, which often deforms shape model locally and thus sensitive to initialization, we propose to learn a regressor to explicitly guide the shape deformation, thus eventually improves the performance of ROI segmentation. The regressor is learned via two steps, (1) a joint classification and regression random forest (CRRF) and (2) an auto-context model. The CRRF predicts each voxel’s deformation to the nearest point on the ROI boundary as well as each voxel’s class label (e.g., ROI versus background). The auto-context model further refines all voxel’s deformations (i.e., deformation field) and class labels (i.e., label maps) by considering the neighboring structures. Compared to the conventional random forest regressor, the proposed regressor provides more accurate deformation field estimation and thus more robust in guiding deformation of the shape model.

In general, most network connectivity models are based on correlations between discrete-time series signals that only connect two different brain regions.

Here we propose a learning-based method to explore subnetwork biomarkers that are significantly distinguishable between two clinical cohorts. Learning on hypergraph is employed in our work. Specifically, we construct a hypergraph by exhaustively inspecting all possible subnetworks for all subjects, where each hyperedge connects a group of subjects demonstrating highly correlated functional connectivity behavior throughout the underlying subnetwork. The objective function of hypergraph learning is to jointly optimize the weights for all hyperedges which make the separation of two groups by the learned data representation be in the best consensus with the observed clinical labels.

While traditional approaches are mostly based on questionnaires, in this paper we present an alternative one that relies on the observation of the individual's interaction with the computer. We show that this interaction changes with the onset of fatigue and that these changes are significant enough to support the training of a neural network that can classify mental fatigue in real time.

Among the various existing methods for landmark detection, regression-based methods have recently attracted much attention due to their robustness and efficiency. In these methods, landmarks are localised through voting from all image voxels, which is completely different from the classification-based methods that use voxel-wise classification to detect landmarks. Despite their robustness, the accuracy of regression-based landmark detection methods is often limited due to (1) the inclusion of uninformative image voxels in the voting procedure, and (2) the lack of effective ways to incorporate inter-landmark spatial dependency into the detection step. In this paper, we propose a collaborative landmark detection framework to address these limitations. The concept of collaboration is reflected in two aspects. (1) Multi-resolution collaboration. A multi-resolution strategy is proposed to hierarchically localise landmarks by gradually excluding uninformative votes from faraway voxels. Moreover, for informative voxels near the landmark, a spherical sampling strategy is also designed at the training stage to improve their prediction accuracy. (2) Inter-landmark collaboration. A confidence-based landmark detection strategy is proposed to improve the detection accuracy of 'difficult-to-detect' landmarks by using spatial guidance from 'easy-to-detect' landmarks. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments extensively on three datasets for detecting prostate landmarks and head & neck landmarks in computed tomography images, and also dental landmarks in cone beam computed tomography images. The results show the effectiveness of our collaborative landmark detection framework in improving landmark detection accuracy, compared to other state-of-the-art methods. © 2015 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","image analysis; image processing; image registration; landmark detection; landmark-based analysis; machine learning; prostate localization","Artificial intelligence; Computerized tomography; Image processing; Image registration; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Regression analysis; Tomography; Urology; Classification based methods; Computed tomography images; Cone-beam computed tomography; Landmark detection; landmark-based analysis; Prostate localization; Spatial dependencies; State-of-the-art methods; Image analysis; cone beam computed tomography; diagnostic imaging; head and neck tumor; human; jaw disease; male; procedures; prostate tumor; regression analysis; reproducibility; three dimensional imaging; x-ray computed tomography; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Mandibular Diseases; Maxillary Diseases; Prostatic Neoplasms; Regression Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

However, most existing methods construct classifiers using data from one particular target domain (e.g., MCI), and ignore data in other related domains (e.g., AD and normal control (NC)) that may provide valuable information to improve MCI conversion prediction performance. To address is limitation, we develop a novel domain transfer learning method for MCI conversion prediction, which can use data from both the target domain (i.e., MCI) and auxiliary domains (i.e., AD and NC). Specifically, the proposed method consists of three key components: 1) a domain transfer feature selection component that selects the most informative feature-subset from both target domain and auxiliary domains from different imaging modalities; 2) a domain transfer sample selection component that selects the most informative sample-subset from the same target and auxiliary domains from different data modalities; and 3) a domain transfer support vector machine classification component that fuses the selected features and samples to separate MCI-C and MCI-NC patients. We evaluate our method on 202 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) that have MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data. The experimental results show the proposed method can classify MCI-C patients from MCI-NC patients with an accuracy of 79.4%, with the aid of additional domain knowledge learned from AD and NC. © 2015 IEEE.","Alzheimer's Disease; Domain Transfer Learning; Feature Selection; Mild Cognitive Impairment Converters; Sample Selection","Artificial intelligence; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine components; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neuroimaging; Alzheimer's disease; Domain transfers; Machine learning methods; Mild cognitive impairments; Mild cognitive impairments (MCI); Prediction performance; Sample selection; Support vector machine classification; Classification (of information); fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; aged; Article; brain region; classifier; Clinical Dementia Rating; controlled study; diagnosis; diagnostic accuracy; disease course; domain transfer learning; human; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; major clinical study; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; support vector machine; Wechsler Memory Scale; Alzheimer disease; case control study; Cognitive Dysfunction; computer assisted diagnosis; factual database; machine learning; middle aged; pathology; procedures; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Case-Control Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; Databases, Factual; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging"

Such procedures are defined by a voting rule and a (restricted) iterative process, where at each step one agent can modify his vote towards a better outcome for himself. It is already known that if the iteration dynamics (the manner in which voters are allowed to modify their votes) are unrestricted, then the voting process may not converge. For most common voting rules this may be observed even under the best response dynamics limitation. It is therefore important to investigate whether and which natural restrictions on the dynamics of iterative voting procedures can guarantee convergence. To this end, we provide two general conditions on the dynamics based on iterative myopic improvements, each of which is sufficient for convergence. We then identify several classes of voting rules (including Positional Scoring Rules, Maximin, Copeland and Bucklin), along with their corresponding iterative processes, for which at least one of these conditions hold.

Simulations show that PSINET achieves ∼60% more information spread over the current state-of-the-art. PSINET was developed in collaboration with My Friend's Place (a drop-in agency serving homeless youth in Los Angeles) and is currently being reviewed by their officials. © Copyright 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).",,"Decision support systems; Approximate solution; Evolving networks; Influence maximizations; Prevention practices; Risk behavior; Spread of informations; State of the art; Word of mouth; Artificial intelligence"

We propose a natural axiom for this setting, which we call justified representation (JR). This axiom requires that if a large enough group of voters exhibits agreement by supporting the same candidate, then at least one voter in this group has an approved candidate in the winning committee. We show that for every list of ballots it is possible to select a committee that provides JR. We then check if this axiom is fulfilled by well-known approval-based voting rules. We show that the answer is negative for most of the rules we consider, with notable exceptions of PAV (Proportional Approval Voting), an extreme version of RAV (Reweighted Approval Voting), and, for a restricted preference domain, MA V (Minimax Approval Voting). We then introduce a stronger version of the JR axiom, which we call extended justified representation (EJR), and show that PAV satisfies EJR, while other rules do not. We also consider several other questions related to JR, and EJR, including the relationship between JR./EJR and unanimity, and the complexity of the associated algorithmic problems.

In order to help people in such situations, this paper provides an innovative methodology for developing an agent that can support people in argumentative discussions by proposing possible arguments to them. By analyzing more than 130 human discussions and 140 questionnaires, answered by people, we show that the well-established Argumentation Theory is not a good predictor of people's choice of arguments. Then, we present a model that has 76% accuracy when predicting peoples top three argument choices given a partial deliberation. We present the Predictive and Relevance based Heuristic agent (PRH), which uses this model with a heuristic that estimates the relevance of possible arguments to the last argument given in order to propose possible arguments. Through extensive human studies with over 200 human subjects, we show that peoples satisfaction from the PRH agent is significantly higher than from other agents that propose arguments based on Argumentation Theory, predict arguments without the heuristics or only the heuristics. People also use the PRH agent's proposed arguments significantly more often than those proposed by the other agents.

The main solution concept there is the Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE), which optimizes the defender's random allocation of limited security resources. However, solely deploying the SSE mixed strategy has limitations. In the extreme case, there are security games in which the defender is able to defend all the assets ""almost perfectly"" at the SSE, but she still sustains significant loss. In this paper, we propose an approach for improving the defender's utility in such scenarios. Perhaps surprisingly, our approach is to strategically reveal to the attacker information about the sampled pure strategy. Specifically, we propose a two-stage security game model, where in the first stage the defender allocates resources and the attacker selects a target to attack, and in the second stage the defender strategically reveals local information about that target, potentially deterring the attacker's attack plan. We then study how the defender can play optimally in both stages. We show, theoretically and experimentally, that the two-stage security game model allows the defender to achieve strictly better utility than SSE.

However, current techniques suffer from several drawbacks in their tracking policy: (i) they usually do not consider the forecasted or prevailing weather conditions; even when they do, they (ii) rely on complex closed-loop controllers and sophisticated instruments; and (iii) typically, they do not take the energy consumption of the trackers into account. In this paper, we propose a policy iteration method (along with specialized variants), which is able to calculate near-optimal trajectories for effective and efficient day-ahead solar tracking, based on weather forecasts coming from online providers. To account for the energy needs of the tracking system, the technique employs a novel and generic consumption model. Our simulations show that the proposed methods can increase the power output of a PVS considerably, when compared to standard solar tracking techniques.

In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid Approach of Classifier and Clustering, which we refer to as HACC, to solve the missing node identification problem in social networks. HACC utilizes a classifier as a preprocessing step in order to integrate all known information into one similarity measure and then uses a clustering algorithm to identify missing nodes. Specifically, we used the information on the network structure, attributes about known users (nodes) and pictorial information to evaluate HACC and found that it performs significantly better than other missing node algorithms. We also argue that HACC is a general approach and domain independent and can be easily applied to other domains. We support this claim by evaluating HACC on a second authorship identification domain as well. Copyright © 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

A wealth of information about public opinions, cur-rent events, and authors' insights into specific topics can be gained by understanding the text written by users. How-ever, there is a wide variation in the language used by different authors in different contexts on the web. This diversity in language makes interpretation an extremely challenging task. Crowdsourcing presents an opportunity to interpret the sentiment, or topic, of free-Text. However, the subjec-tivity and bias of human interpreters raise challenges in in-ferring the semantics expressed by the text. To overcome this problem, we present a novel Bayesian approach to lan-guage understanding that relies on aggregated crowdsourced judgements. Our model encodes the relationships between labels and text features in documents, such as tweets, web articles, and blog posts, accounting for the varying reliability of human labellers. It allows inference of annotations that scales to arbitrarily large pools of documents. Our evalu-ation using two challenging crowdsourcing datasets shows that by efficiently exploiting language models learnt from aggregated crowdsourced labels, we can provide up to 25% improved classifications when only a small portion, less than 4% of documents has been labelled. Compared to the six state-of-The-Art methods, we reduce by up to 67% the num-ber of crowd responses required to achieve comparable accu-racy.

According to a given query in the training set, the documents are divided into several groups based upon their relevance labels. The group with higher relevance labels is always ranked upon the ones with lower relevance labels. Further a preference strategy is introduced in the loss functions, which are sensitive to the group with higher relevance labels to enhance the group ranking method.

Hence, it is fundamental to design and construct buildings that are energy-efficient. It is known that the early stage of architectural design has a significant impact on this matter. However, it is complex to create designs that are optimally energy efficient, and at the same time balance other essential criterias such as economics, space, and safety. One state-of-the art approach is to create parametric designs, and use a genetic algorithm to optimize across different objectives. We further improve this method, by aggregating the solutions of multiple agents. We evaluate diverse teams, composed by different agents; and uniform teams, composed by multiple copies of a single agent.

This prediction can be executed at any moment during problem-solving and it is completely domain independent. We present a preliminary theoretical explanation of why our prediction method works, where we show that the accuracy is better for diverse teams composed by different agents than for uniform teams made of copies of the same agent. We also perform experiments in the Computer Go domain, where we show that we can obtain a high accuracy in predicting the final outcome of the games.

Typically, approaches that seek to address this challenge use a model that captures the thermal dynamics within a building, also referred to as a thermal model. Among thermal models, gray-box models are a popular choice for modeling the thermal dynamics of buildings. They combine knowledge of the physical structure of a building with various data-driven inputs and are accurate estimators of the state (internal temperature). However, existing gray-box models require a detailed specification of all the physical elements that can affect the thermal dynamics of a building a priori. This limits their applicability, particularly in residential buildings, where additional dynamics can be induced by human activities such as cooking, which contributes additional heat, or opening of windows, which leads to additional leakage of heat. Since the incidence of these additional dynamics is rarely known, their combined effects cannot readily be accommodated within existing models. To overcome this limitation and improve the general applicability of gray-box models, we introduce a novel model, which we refer to as a latent force thermal model of the thermal dynamics of a building, or LFM-TM. Our model is derived from an existing gray-box thermal model, which is augmented with an extra term referred to as the learned residual. This term is capable of modeling the effect of any a priori unknown additional dynamic, which, if not captured, appears as a structure in a thermal model's residual (the error induced by the model). More importantly, the learned residual can also capture the effects of physical elements such as a building's envelope or the lags in a heating system, leading to a significant reduction in complexity compared to existing models. To evaluate the performance of LFM-TM, we apply it to two independent data sources. The first is an established dataset, referred to as the FlexHouse data, which was previously used for evaluating the efficacy of existing gray-box models [Bacher and Madsen 2011]. The second dataset consists of heating data logged within homes located on the University of Southampton campus, which were specifically instrumented to collect data for our thermal modeling experiments. On both datasets, we show that LFM-TM outperforms existing models in its ability to accurately fit the observed data, generate accurate day-ahead internal temperature predictions, and explain a large amount of the variability in the future observations. This, along with the fact that we also use a corresponding efficient sequential inference scheme for LFM-TM, makes it an ideal candidate for model-based predictive control, where having accurate online predictions of internal temperatures is essential for high-quality solutions. © 2015 ACM.","Artificial intelligence; Energy savings; HVAC; Latent force models; Residential buildings; Smart homes; Sustainability; Thermal models","Air conditioning; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Dynamics; Energy conservation; Forecasting; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Model predictive control; Quality control; Sustainable development; Thermography (temperature measurement); Force model; HVAC; Residential building; Smart homes; Thermal model; Buildings"

To this end, intelligent domestic heating agents (IDHAs) aim to operate domestic heating systems more efficiently with minimum user input. In this work, we propose a new general IDHA that balances heating cost and thermal discomfort in an infinite horizon optimization manner, learns an adaptive thermal model of the system under control on-line and plans a heating schedule that fully exploits the probabilistic occupancy estimates. Importantly, our agent adapts to the user preferences in balancing heating cost and thermal discomfort, as it relies on a single parametrization variable that is learned on-line, and is able to consider a wide range of heating systems typically employed in domestic settings. The backbone of our IDHA is an adaptive model predictive control approach along with a new general planning algorithm that utilizes dynamic programming. We present a thorough evaluation of our approach, and show its effectiveness in terms of Pareto efficiency and usability criteria against state-of-the-art IDHAs. By so doing, we also conduct a comprehensive characterization of existing IDHAs to provide significant insights about their performance in different operational settings.

Since most intermodality registration methods simply estimate deformations in a local scale, but optimizing MI from the entire image, the estimated deformations for certain structures could be dominated by the surrounding unrelated structures. Also, since there often exist multiple structures in each image, the intensity correlation between two images could be complex and highly nonlinear, which makes global MI unable to precisely guide local image deformation. To solve these issues, we propose a hierarchical inter-modality registration method by robust feature matching. Specifically, we first select a small set of key points at salient image locations to drive the entire image registration. Since the original image features computed from different modalities are often difficult for direct comparison, we propose to learn their common feature representations by projecting them from their native feature spaces to a common space, where the correlations between corresponding features are maximized. Due to the large heterogeneity between two high-dimension feature distributions, we employ Kernel CCA (Canonical Correlation Analysis) to reveal such non-linear feature mappings. Then, our registration method can take advantage of the learned common features to reliably establish correspondences for key points from different modality images by robust feature matching. As more and more key points take part in the registration, our hierarchical feature-based image registration method can efficiently estimate the deformation pathway between two inter-modality images in a global to local manner. We have applied our proposed registration method to prostate CT and MR images, as well as the infant MR brain images in the first year of life. Experimental results show that our method can achieve more accurate registration results, compared to other state-of-the-art image registration methods. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Artificial intelligence; Brain mapping; Computer aided instruction; Computerized tomography; Deformation; Image registration; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Accurate registration; Canonical correlation analysis; Feature distribution; Hierarchical features; Intensity correlation; Multimodal image registration; Mutual informations; Registration methods; Medical imaging"

However, in these attempts, a choice function is completely specified. That is, given any subset of options, called an issue, the best option over that issue is always known, whilst in real-world scenarios, it is very often that only a few choices are known instead of all. In this paper, we study partial choice functions and investigate necessary and sufficient rationality conditions for situations where only a few choices are known. We prove that our necessary and sufficient condition for partial choice functions boils down to the necessary and sufficient conditions for complete choice functions proposed in the literature. Choice functions have been instrumental in belief revision theory. That is, in most approaches to belief revision, the problem studied can simply be described as the choice of possible worlds compatible with the input information, given an agent’s prior belief state. The main effort has been to devise strategies in order to infer the agents revised belief state. Our study considers the converse problem: given a collection of input information items and their corresponding revision results (as provided by an agent), does there exist a rational revision operation used by the agent and a consistent belief state that may explain the observed results? © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computers; Belief revision; Choice function; Information items; Possible worlds; Real-world scenario; Rational functions"

This is in part due to the fact that the working capacity and the performance of an individual, either physical or mental, generally decrease as the day progresses, although factors like motivation also play a significant role. These negative effects are especially significant when carrying out long or demanding tasks, as often happens in an educational context. In order to avoid these effects, initiatives to promote a good management of the time and effort invested in each task are mandatory. Such initiatives, when effective, can have a wide range of positive effects, including on the performance, productivity, attention and even mental health. Seeking to find a viable and realistic approach to address this problem, this paper presents a non-invasive and non-intrusive way to measure mental workload, one of the aspects that affects mental fatigue the most. Specifically, we target scenarios of e-learning, in which the professor may not be present to assess the student's state. The aim is to create a tool that enables an actual management of fatigue in such environments and thus allows for the implementation of more efficient learning processes, adapted to the abilities and state of each student.","E-learning; Fatigue management; Human performance; Machine learning; Mental fatigue; Mental workload","Artificial intelligence; Diseases; Embedded systems; Learning systems; E-learning scenario; Educational context; Efficient learning; Fatigue management; Human performance; Mental fatigue; Mental workload; Performance degradation; E-learning"

Appropriate tuning of the underlying parameters can drastically improve the performance of a meta-heuristic. The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a population based meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of the ants, is no different. Fundamentally, the ACO depends on the construction of new solutions, variable by variable basis using Gaussian sampling of the selected variables from an archive of solutions. A comprehensive performance analysis of the underlying parameters such as: selection strategy, distance measure metric and pheromone evaporation rate of the ACO suggests that the Roulette Wheel Selection strategy enhances the performance of the ACO due to its ability to provide non-uniformity and adequate diversity in the selection of a solution. On the other hand, the Squared Euclidean distance-measure metric offers better performance than other distance-measure metrics. It is observed from the analysis that the ACO is sensitive towards the evaporation rate. Experimental analysis between classical ACO and other meta-heuristic suggested that the performance of the well-tuned ACO surpasses its counterparts. © 2014 IEEE.","Ant colony optimization; Continuous optimization; Metaheuristic; Performance analysis","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Evaporation; Heuristic algorithms; Intelligent systems; Optimization; Systems analysis; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Comprehensive performance; Continuous function optimization; Continuous optimization; Meta heuristic algorithm; Metaheuristic; Performance analysis; Squared euclidean distance; Ant colony optimization"

In MAS, a novel target image is segmented by fusing the label maps of a set of annotated images (or atlases), after spatial normalization. Weighted voting is a well-known label fusion strategy consisting of computing each target label as a weighted average of the atlas labels in a local neighborhood. The weights, denoting the local anatomical similarity of the candidate atlases, are often approximated using image-patch similarity measurements. Such an approach, known as patch-based label fusion (PBLF), may fail to discriminate the anatomically relevant patches in challenging regions with high label variability. In order to overcome this limitation we propose a supervised method that embeds the original image patches onto a space that emphasizes the appearance characteristics that are critical for a correct labeling, while supressing the irrelevant ones. We show that PBLF using the embedded patches compares favourably with state-of-the-art methods in brain MR image segmentation experiments. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Maps; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Anatomical similarity; Brain MR image segmentation; Dimensionality reduction; Local neighborhoods; Similarity measurements; Spatial normalization; State-of-the-art methods; Supervised methods; Image segmentation"

Existing approaches focus on probabilistic modelling of user's reliability as the key to accurate aggregation. However, these are either limited to estimating discrete quantities, or require a significant number of reports from each user to accurately model their reliability. To mitigate these issues, we adopt a community-based approach, which reduces the data required to reliably aggregate real-valued estimates, by leveraging correlations between the reporting behaviour of users belonging to different communities. As a result, our method is up to 16.6% more accurate than existing state-of-the-art methods and is up to 49% more effective under data sparsity when used to estimate Wi-Fi hotspot locations in a real-world crowdsourcing application.",,"Bayesian networks; Bayesian modelling; Community based approach; Community-based; Multi-dimensional trust; Participatory Sensing; Participatory sensing applications; Probabilistic modelling; State-of-the-art methods; Artificial intelligence"

In RF, each sample is directed from the root to each leaf based on the decisions made in the interior nodes, also called splitting nodes. The splitting nodes assign a testing sample to either left or right child based on the learned splitting function. The final prediction is determined as the average of label probability distributions stored in all arrived leaf nodes. For ambiguous testing samples, which often lie near the splitting boundaries, the conventional splitting function, also referred to as hard split function, tends to make wrong assignments, hence leading to wrong predictions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel soft-split random forest (SSRF) framework to improve the reliability of node splitting and finally the accuracy of classification. Specifically, a soft split function is employed to assign a testing sample into both left and right child nodes with their certain probabilities, which can effectively reduce influence of the wrong node assignment on the prediction accuracy. As a result, each testing sample can arrive at multiple leaf nodes, and their respective results can be fused to obtain the final prediction according to the weights accumulated along the path from the root node to each leaf node. Besides, considering the importance of context information, we also adopt a Haar-features based context model to iteratively refine the classification map. We have comprehensively evaluated our method on two public datasets, respectively, for labeling hippo-campus in MR images and also labeling three organs in Head & Neck CT images. Compared with the hard-split RF (HSRF), our method achieved a notable improvement in labeling accuracy. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computer aided instruction; Computerized tomography; Decision trees; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Probability distributions; Query processing; Accuracy of classifications; Context information; Context modeling; Labeling accuracies; Node-splitting; Prediction accuracy; Splitting nodes; Testing samples; Medical imaging"

In this paper, we propose multi-atlas context forests to first segment bones and then segment cartilages. Specifically, for both the bone and cartilage segmentations, we iteratively train sets of random forests, based on training atlas images, to classify the individual voxels. The random forests rely on (1) the appearance features directly computed from images and also (2) the context features associated with tentative segmentation results, generated by the previous layer of random forest in the iterative framework. To extract context features, multiple atlases (with expert segmentation) are first registered, with the tentative segmentation result of the subject under consideration. Then, the spatial priors of anatomical labels of registered atlases are computed and used to calculate context features of the subject. Note that these multi-atlas context features will be iteratively refined based on the (updated) tentative segmentation result of the subject. As better segmentation result leads to more accurate registration between multiple atlases and the subject, context features will become increasingly more useful for the training of subsequent random forests in the iterative framework. As validated by experiments on the SKI10 dataset, our proposed method can achieve high segmentation accuracy. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Artificial intelligence; Bone; Cartilage; Computer aided instruction; Decision trees; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Accurate registration; Bone and cartilages; Context features; Iterative framework; Random forests; Segmentation accuracy; Segmentation results; Spatial priors; Image segmentation"

Focusing on games under Plurality, we extend the standard model to allow for situations where voters may refuse to return their votes to those candidates who had previously left the election, should they decide to run again. We show that if at the time when a candidate withdraws his candidacy, with some positive probability each voter takes this candidate out of his future consideration, the process converges with probability 1. This is in sharp contrast with the original model where the very existence of a Nash equilibrium is not guaranteed. We then consider the two extreme cases of this setting, where voters may block a withdrawn candidate with probabilities 0 or 1. In these scenarios, we study the complexity of reaching equilibria from a given initial point, converging to an equilibrium with a predermined winner or to an equilibrium with a given set of running candidates.

For orthognathic surgical planning, it is critical to have a patient-specific jaw reference model as guidance. One way is to estimate a normal jaw shape for the patient, by first searching for a normal subject with similar midface and then borrowing his/her (normal) jaw shape as reference. Intuitively, we can search for multiple normal subjects with similar midface and then linearly combine them as final reference. The respective coefficients for linear combination can be estimated, i.e., by sparse representation of patient’s midface by midfaces of all training normal subjects. However, this approach implicitly assumes that the representation of midface shapes is strongly correlated with the representation of jaw shapes, which is unfortunately difficult to meet in practice due to generally different data distributions of shapes of midfaces and jaws. To address this limitation, we propose to estimate the patient-specific jaw reference model in a coherent space. Specifically, we first employ canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to map the midface and jaw landmarks of training normal subjects into a coherent space, in which their correlation is maximized. Then, in the coherent space, the mapped midface landmarks of patient can be sparsely represented by the mapped midface landmarks of training normal subjects. Those learned sparse coefficients can now be used to combine the jaw landmarks of training normal subjects for estimating the normal jaw landmarks for patient and then building normal jaw shape reference model. Moreover, we also iteratively maximize the correlation between the midface and the jaw shapes in the new coherent space with a multi-layer mapping and refinement (MMR) process. Experimental results on real clinical data show that the proposed method can more accurately reconstruct the normal jaw shape for patient than the competing methods. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Deformation; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Surgery; Canonical correlation analysis; Craniomaxillofacial; Data distribution; Deformity correction; Linear combinations; Orthognathic surgeries; Reference modeling; Sparse representation; Medical imaging"

While previous research on patrolling games has considered the attacker's real-time surveillance, our settings, therefore models and techniques, are fundamentally different. More specifically, after describing the information leakage model, we start with an LP formulation to compute the defender's optimal strategy in the presence of leakage. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that a key subproblem to solve this LP (more precisely, the defender oracle) is NP-hard even for the simplest of security game models.

First, we present a model which has 78% accuracy in predicting drivers' reactions to different advice in different situations. Using the prediction model, we designed a Markov Decision Process which solution provided the advising policy for MACS. Through empirical evaluation using an electric car, with 83 human subjects, we show that MACS successfully reduced the energy consumption of the subjects by 33% compared to subjects who were not equipped with MACS. MACS also outperformed the state-of-the-art Social agent for Advice Provision (SAP).",,"Artificial intelligence; Automobiles; Climate control; Control systems; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Markov processes; Automated agents; Automobile climate control; Empirical evaluations; Energy consumer; Human subjects; Markov Decision Processes; Prediction model; State of the art; Adaptive control systems"

The goal of the decision-maker is to maximise the total expected value of chosen items with respect to the knapsack capacity and a finite time horizon. We provide the first comprehensive theoretical analysis of the problem. In particular, we propose OPT-S-MCKP, the first algorithm that achieves optimality when the value-weight distributions are known. This algorithm also enjoys O(√T) performance loss, where T is the finite time horizon, in the unknown value-weight distributions scenario. We also further develop two novel approximation methods, FR-S-MCKP and G-S-MCKP, and we prove that FR-S-MCKP achieves O(√T) performance loss in both known and unknown value-weight distributions cases, while enjoying polynomial computational complexity per time step. On the other hand, G-S-MCKP does not have theoretical guarantees, but it still provides good performance in practice with linear running time.",,"Artificial intelligence; Combinatorial optimization; Decision making; Polynomial approximation; Stochastic systems; Approximation methods; Decision makers; Finite time horizon; Multiple choice knapsack problem; Performance guarantees; Performance loss; Theoretical guarantees; Weight distributions; Algorithms"

Two competitive approaches have been pursued by previous work on addressing uncertainties in SSGs, namely: (1) applying robust optimization techniques without requiring a prior distribution; and (2) using probabilistic models to capture uncertainties. In general, the decision of which approach to use is based on the availability of data. While the first approach suits data-sparse domains, the second approach works better for data-rich domains. My thesis will focus on addressing uncertainties in SSGs following these two leading approaches. In particular, with regards to robust methods, I attempt to develop new maximin/minimax regret-based robust algorithms for computing a defender's optimal strategy given uncertainties. I also aim to contribute to probabilistic modeling techniques by developing a new computational model of human decision making to capture the adversary's bounded rationality.

Moreover, these actions also show how behaviors differ between different scenarios or contexts. However, Human behavior is a complex issue as it results from the interaction of various internal and external factors such as personality, culture, education, social roles and social context, life experiences, among many others. This implies that a specific user may show different behaviors for a similar circumstance if one or more of these factors change. In past work we have addressed the development of behavior-based user identification based on keystroke and mouse dynamics. However, user states such as stress or fatigue significantly change interaction patterns, risking the accuracy of the identification.

Longitudinal neuroimaging analysis and modeling have become the new trend to advance research in this field. However, this is challenged by a limited number of acquisition timepoints and the absence of inter-subject matching between timepoints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that unprecedentedly solves the problem of predicting the dynamic evolution of infant cortical surface shape solely from a single baseline shape based on a spatiotemporal (4D) current-based learning approach. Specifically, our method learns from longitudinal data both the geometric (vertices positions) and dynamic (temporal evolution trajectories) features of the infant cortical surface, comprising a training stage and a prediction stage. In the training stage, we first use the current-based shape regression model to set up the inter-subject cortical surface correspondences at baseline of all training subjects. We then estimate for each training subject the diffeomorphic temporal evolution trajectories of the cortical surface shape and build an empirical mean spatiotemporal surface atlas. In the prediction stage, given an infant, we first warp all training subjects onto its baseline cortical surface. Second, we select the most appropriate learnt features from training subjects to simultaneously predict the cortical surface shapes at all later timepoints from its baseline cortical surface, based on closeness metrics between this baseline surface and the learnt baseline population average surface atlas. We used the proposed framework to predict the inner cortical surface shape at 3, 6 and 9 months from the cortical shape at birth in 9 healthy infants.

Specifically, we extract both Region-Of-Interest (ROI) features and Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features from each MRI image, and then propose mapping HOG features onto the space of ROI features to make them comparable and to impose high intra-class similarity with low inter-class similarity. Finally, both mapped HOG features and original ROI features are input to the support vector machine for AD diagnosis. The purpose of mapping HOG features onto the space of ROI features is to provide complementary information so that features from different views can not only be comparable (i.e., homogeneous) but also be interpretable. For example, ROI features are robust to noise, but lack of reflecting small or subtle changes, while HOG features are diverse but less robust to noise. The proposed multi-view learning method is designed to learn the transformation between two spaces and to separate the classes under the supervision of class labels. The experimental results on the MRI images from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset show that the proposed multi-view method helps enhance disease status identification performance, outperforming both baseline methods and state-of-the-art methods. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Diagnosis; Image processing; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mapping; Neuroimaging; Baseline methods; Class labels; Histograms of oriented gradients (HoG); Inter class; Multi-view learning; Region of interest; State-of-the-art methods; Status identifications; Medical imaging"

Recently, multitask feature selection methods are typically used for joint selection of common features across multiple modalities. However, one disadvantage of existing multimodality based methods is that they ignore the useful data distribution information in each modality, which is essential for subsequent classification. Accordingly, in this paper we propose a manifold regularized multitask feature learning method to preserve both the intrinsic relatedness among multiple modalities of data and the data distribution information in each modality. Specifically, we denote the feature learning on each modality as a single task, and use group-sparsity regularizer to capture the intrinsic relatedness among multiple tasks (i.e., modalities) and jointly select the common features from multiple tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a new manifold-based Laplacian regularizer to preserve the data distribution information from each task. Finally, we use the multikernel support vector machine method to fuse multimodality data for eventual classification. Conversely, we also extend our method to the semisupervised setting, where only partial data are labeled. We evaluate our method using the baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data of subjects from AD neuroimaging initiative database.

This short paper briefly explains how a recent generalization of possibilistic logic (GPL) can be used to characterize the semantics of answer set programming. This characterization has several advantages over existing characterizations of the stable model semantics. First, unlike reduct-based approaches, it does not rely on a syntactic procedure: we can directly characterize answer sets based on the minimally specific models of a GPL theory. Second, GPL enables us to study extensions of ASP in an intuitive way: unlike in existing generalizations of ASP such as equilibrium logic and autoepistemic logic, all formulas in GPL have a meaning which is intuitively clear. Finally, being based on possibilistic logic, GPL offers a natural way of dealing with uncertainty in answer set programs. © Copyright 2015, for this paper by its authors.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer programming; Knowledge representation; Logic programming; Reconfigurable hardware; Semantics; A-stable; Answer set; Answer set programming; Equilibrium logic; Negation as failures; Possibilistic logic; Stable model semantics; Computer circuits"

Such cost to serve analysis has application both strategically and operationally in transportation. The problem is formally given by the traveling salesperson game (TSG), a cooperative total utility game in which agents correspond to locations in a travelling salesperson problem (TSP). The cost to serve a location is an allocated portion of the cost of an optimal tour. The Shapley value is one of the most important normative division schemes in cooperative games, giving a principled and fair allocation both for the TSG and more generally. We consider a number of direct and sampling-based procedures for calculating the Shap-ley value, and present the first proof that approximating the Shapley value of the TSG within a constant factor is NP-hard. Treating the Shapley value as an ideal baseline allocation, we then develop six proxies for that value which are relatively easy to compute. We perform an experimental evaluation using Synthetic Euclidean games as well as games derived from real-world tours calculated for fast-moving consumer goods scenarios. Our experiments show that several computationally tractable allocation techniques correspond to good proxies for the Shapley value.",,"Artificial intelligence; Costs; Game theory; Location; Constant factors; Cooperative game; Experimental evaluation; Fair allocation; Fast moving consumer goods; Sampling-based; Transport costs; Travelling salesperson problems; Cost benefit analysis"

Possibility theory lies at the crossroads between fuzzy sets, probability, and nonmonotonic reasoning. Possibility theory can be cast either in an ordinal or in a numerical setting. Qualitative possibility theory is closely related to belief revision theory, and commonsense reasoning with exception-tainted knowledge in artificial intelligence. Possibilistic logic provides a rich representation setting, which enables the handling of lower bounds of possibility theory measures, while remaining close to classical logic. Qualitative possibility theory has been axiomatically justified in a decision-theoretic framework in the style of Savage, thus providing a foundation for qualitative decision theory. Quantitative possibility theory is the simplest framework for statistical reasoning with imprecise probabilities. As such, it has close connections with random set theory and confidence intervals, and can provide a tool for uncertainty propagation with limited statistical or subjective information. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,"Set theory; Commonsense reasoning; Imprecise probabilities; Non-monotonic reasoning; Possibilistic logic; Qualitative possibility theory; Statistical reasoning; Subjective information; Uncertainty propagation; Decision theory"

To this end, we utilize the framework of persuasion games-a branch of game theory that deals with asymmetric interactions where one player (Sender) possesses more information about the world, but it is only the other player (Receiver) who can take an action. In particular, we use an extended persuasion model, where the Sender's information is imperfect and the Receiver has more than two alternative actions available. We design a computational algorithm that, from the Sender's standpoint, calculates the optimal information disclosure rule. The algorithm is parameterized by the Receiver's decision model (i.e., what choice he will make based on the information disclosed by the Sender) and can be retuned accordingly. We then provide an extensive experimental study of the algorithm's performance in interactions with human Receivers. First, we consider a fully rational (in the Bayesian sense) Receiver decision model and experimentally show the efficacy of the resulting Sender's solution in a routing domain. Despite the discrepancy in the Sender's and the Receiver's utilities from each of the Receiver's choices, our Sender agent successfully persuaded human Receivers to select an option more beneficial for the agent. Dropping the Receiver's rationality assumption, we introduce a machine learning procedure that generates a more realistic human Receiver model. We then show its significant benefit to the Sender solution by repeating our routing experiment. To complete our study, we introduce a second (supply-demand) experimental domain and, by contrasting it with the routing domain, obtain general guidelines for a Sender on how to construct a Receiver model. © 2014 ACM.","Human modeling; Human-agent interaction; Information disclosure; Persuasion","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Computation theory; Game theory; Learning systems; Algorithm's performance; Asymmetric interaction; Computational algorithm; Human agent interactions; Human Model; Information disclosure; Persuasion; Receiver modeling; Algorithms"

Here, we focus on the problems of both feature representation and fusion of multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). To our best knowledge, the previous methods in the literature mostly used hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness, gray matter densities from MRI, or voxel intensities from PET, and then combined these multimodal features by simply concatenating into a long vector or transforming into a higher-dimensional kernel space. In this paper, we propose a novel method for a high-level latent and shared feature representation from neuroimaging modalities via deep learning. Specifically, we use Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM). 22Although it is clear from the context that the acronym DBM denotes ""Deep Boltzmann Machine"" in this paper, we would clearly indicate that DBM here is not related to ""Deformation Based Morphometry""., a deep network with a restricted Boltzmann machine as a building block, to find a latent hierarchical feature representation from a 3D patch, and then devise a systematic method for a joint feature representation from the paired patches of MRI and PET with a multimodal DBM. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on ADNI dataset and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In three binary classification problems of AD vs. healthy Normal Control (NC), MCI vs. NC, and MCI converter vs. MCI non-converter, we obtained the maximal accuracies of 95.35%, 85.67%, and 74.58%, respectively, outperforming the competing methods.

Collecting the feature values into a matrix, with each row containing a feature vector of a sample, we propose a framework to predict the corresponding associated multiple target outputs (e.g., diagnosis label and clinical scores) from this feature matrix by performing matrix shrinkage following matrix completion. Specifically, we first combine the feature and target output matrices into a large matrix and then partition this large incomplete matrix into smaller submatrices, each consisting of samples with complete feature values (corresponding to a certain combination of modalities) and target outputs. Treating each target output as the outcome of a prediction task, we apply a 2-step multi-task learning algorithm to select the most discriminative features and samples in each submatrix. Features and samples that are not selected in any of the submatrices are discarded, resulting in a shrunk version of the original large matrix. The missing feature values and unknown target outputs of the shrunk matrix is then completed simultaneously.

Few works have dealt with this matter in the past but they include some by Halpern, and Benferhat et al. Here we focus on semantic aspects, namely the construction of a partial order on interpretations from a partial order on formulas and conversely. It requires the capability of inducing a partial order on subsets of a set from a partial order on its elements. The difficult point lies in the fact that equivalent definitions in the totally ordered case are no longer equivalent in the partially ordered one. We give arguments for selecting one approach extending comparative possibility and its preadditive refinement, pursuing some previous works by Halpern. It comes close to non-monotonic inference relations in the style of Kraus Lehmann and Magidor. We define an intuitively appealing notion of closure of a partially ordered belief base from a semantic standpoint, and show its limitations in terms of expressiveness, due to the fact that a partial ordering on subsets of a set cannot be expressed by means of a single partial order on the sets of elements. We also discuss several existing languages and syntactic inference techniques devised for reasoning from partially ordered belief bases in the light of this difficulty. The long term purpose is to find a proof method adapted to partially ordered formulas, liable of capturing a suitable notion of semantic closure. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",,"Inference techniques; Non-monotonic inference; Partial order; Possibilistic logic; Preorders; Proof methods; Total order; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Semantics"

In order to fulfill this goal, we analyze a set of commercial providers (in this case twenty four) and some research projects (in this circumstance six). Supported by the results so far achieved, a new approach to deal with the problem of ODR is proposed, in which we take on some of the problems identified in the current state of the art in linking ODR and AI. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Alternative dispute resolution; Artificial intelligence; Online dispute resolution","Alternative dispute resolution; Conflict Resolution; Critical evaluation; Dispute resolution; Electronic contracting; On-line dispute resolution; State of the art; Tools and techniques; Laws and legislation; Artificial intelligence"

On the other hand, the IGRT workflow involves collecting a series of computed tomography (CT) images from the same patient under treatment. These images contain valuable patient-specific information yet are often neglected by previous works. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework, namely incremental learning with selective memory (ILSM), to effectively learn the patient-specific appearance characteristics from these patient-specific images. Specifically, starting with a population-based discriminative appearance model, ILSM aims to 'personalize' the model to fit patient-specific appearance characteristics. The model is personalized with two steps: backward pruning that discards obsolete population-based knowledge and forward learning that incorporates patient-specific characteristics. By effectively combining the patient-specific characteristics with the general population statistics, the incrementally learned appearance model can localize the prostate of a specific patient much more accurately. This work has three contributions: 1) the proposed incremental learning framework can capture patient-specific characteristics more effectively, compared to traditional learning schemes, such as pure patient-specific learning, population-based learning, and mixture learning with patient-specific and population data; 2) this learning framework does not have any parametric model assumption, hence, allowing the adoption of any discriminative classifier; and 3) using ILSM, we can localize the prostate in treatment CTs accurately (DSC ∼0.89 ) and fast (∼4 s), which satisfies the real-world clinical requirements of IGRT. © 2013 IEEE.","Anatomy detection; Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT); Incremental learning; Machine learning; Prostate segmentation","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Male; Prostate; Radiotherapy, Image-Guided; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

Quantitative measurement of abnormality of brain connectivity in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), have also been widely reported, especially at a group level. Recently, machine learning techniques have been applied to the study of AD and MCI, i.e., to identify the individuals with AD/MCI from the healthy controls (HCs). However, most existing methods focus on using only a single property of a connectivity network, although multiple network properties, such as local connectivity and global topological properties, can potentially be used. In this paper, by employing multikernel based approach, we propose a novel connectivity based framework to integrate multiple properties of connectivity network for improving the classification performance. Specifically, two different types of kernels (i.e., vector-based kernel and graph kernel) are used to quantify two different yet complementary properties of the network, i.e., local connectivity and global topological properties. Then, multikernel learning (MKL) technique is adopted to fuse these heterogeneous kernels for neuroimaging classification. We test the performance of our proposed method on two different data sets. First, we test it on the functional connectivity networks of 12 MCI and 25 HC subjects. The results show that our method achieves significant performance improvement over those using only one type of network property. Specifically, our method achieves a classification accuracy of 91.9%, which is 10.8% better than those by single network-property-based methods. Then, we test our method for gender classification on a large set of functional connectivity networks with 133 infants scanned at birth, 1 year, and 2 years, also demonstrating very promising results. © 1964-2012 IEEE.","Connectivity network; connectivity property; mild cognitive impairment (MCI); multikernel learning (MKL); topological property","Classification performance; Connectivity properties; Functional connectivity networks; Global topological properties; Machine learning techniques; Mild cognitive impairments (MCI); Multi-kernel learning; Topological properties; Learning systems; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neuroimaging; Topology; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain function; clinical article; disease classification; female; human; machine learning; male; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; Adult; Algorithms; Area Under Curve; Artificial Intelligence; Brain Mapping; Case-Control Studies; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mild Cognitive Impairment; ROC Curve; Sex Determination Analysis; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"

A grid system provides location-independent access to the resources and services of geographically distributed machines. An essential ingredient for supporting location-independent computations is the ability to discover resources that have been requested by the users. Because the number of grid users can increase and the grid environment is continuously changing, a scheduler that can discover decentralized resources is needed. Grid resource scheduling is considered to be a complicated, NP-hard problem because of the distribution of resources, the changing conditions of resources, and the unreliability of infrastructure communication. Various artificial intelligence algorithms have been proposed for scheduling tasks in a computational grid. This paper uses the imperialist competition algorithm (ICA) to address the problem of independent task scheduling in a grid environment, with the aim of reducing the makespan. Experimental results compare ICA with other algorithms and illustrate that ICA finds a shorter makespan relative to the others. Moreover, it converges quickly, finding its optimum solution in less time than the other algorithms. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

This is an important real world application, not only because building design and construction is one of the world's largest industries measured by global expenditures, but also because the early stage design decision making has a significant impact on the energy consumption of buildings. We present a mapping between the domain of architecture and engineering research and that of the agent models present in the literature. We study the importance of forming diverse teams when aggregating the opinions of different agents for architectural design, and also the effect of having agents optimizing for different factors of a multi-objective optimization design problem. We find that a diverse team of agents is able to provide a higher number of top ranked solutions for the early stage designer to choose from.

The axiom ensures that a group of agents that is large enough should have at least one approved candidate in the winning set. The concept has some better computational, fairness, and proportionality properties than some of the previous approaches for proportional voting using approval ballots. We show that some standard approval-based multi-winner rules - AV (approval voting), SAV (satisfaction approval voting) and MAV (minimax approval voting) - do not satisfy justified representation. We suggest natural modifications of MA V as well as PA V (proportional approval voting) that satisfy justified representation. We then present a simple linear-time algorithm that satisfies justified representation and constitutes a reasonable approval-based rule in its own right.

Without niching strategies, they usually converge to a single optimum, even in multimodal search spaces where numerous global or local solutions exist. In the literature, several niching approaches have been proposed for simultaneously computing multiple optima, though most of them require some user-specified parameters that should be calculated a priori, i.e. additional knowledge about the problem domain is required. Recently, it was demonstrated that particle swarm optimization (PSO) using a ring topology for neighborhood definition can give rise to robust and parameterless niching methods. Nevertheless, their performance dramatically worsens when the dimensionality of the solution space hikes, thus increasing the number of local optima. This paper aims at enhancing the performance of these types of PSO-based algorithms by introducing two procedures: (1) a differential operator for improving the search ability and (2) a heuristic clearing operator for controlling the swarm diversity. Such operators are probabilistically activated through a novel self-adaptive learning strategy. Empirical results confirm the superiority of our proposed scheme with respect to six other competitive niching techniques. © 2013 IEEE.","differential operator; heuristic clearing; multimodal optimization; particle swarm optimizer; ring topology","Artificial intelligence; Differential equations; Heuristic algorithms; Mathematical operators; Topology; Differential operators; heuristic clearing; Multi-modal optimization; Particle swarm optimizers; Ring topology; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)"

This so-called crowdsourcing has been applied successfully to a range of tasks, from translating text and annotating images, to collecting information during crisis situations and hiring skilled workers to build complex software. While traditionally these tasks have been small and could be completed by non-professionals, organisations are now starting to crowdsource larger, more complex tasks to experts in their respective fields. These tasks include, for example, software development and testing, web design and product marketing. While this emerging expert crowdsourcing offers flexibility and potentially lower costs, it also raises new challenges, as workers can be highly heterogeneous, both in their costs and in the quality of the work they produce. Specifically, the utility of each outsourced task is uncertain and can vary significantly between distinct workers and even between subsequent tasks assigned to the same worker. Furthermore, in realistic settings, workers have limits on the amount of work they can perform and the employer will have a fixed budget for paying workers. Given this uncertainty and the relevant constraints, the objective of the employer is to assign tasks to workers in order to maximise the overall utility achieved. To formalise this expert crowdsourcing problem, we introduce a novel multi-armed bandit (MAB) model, the bounded MAB. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm to solve it efficiently, called bounded ε-first, which proceeds in two stages: exploration and exploitation. During exploration, it first uses εB of its total budget B to learn estimates of the workers' quality characteristics. Then, during exploitation, it uses the remaining (1-ε)B to maximise the total utility based on those estimates. Using this technique allows us to derive an O(B23) upper bound on its performance regret (i.e., the expected difference in utility between our algorithm and the optimum), which means that as the budget B increases, the regret tends to 0. In addition to this theoretical advance, we apply our algorithm to real-world data from oDesk, a prominent expert crowdsourcing site. Using data from real projects, including historic project budgets, expert costs and quality ratings, we show that our algorithm outperforms existing crowdsourcing methods by up to 300%, while achieving up to 95% of a hypothetical optimum with full information. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Budget limitation; Crowdsourcing; Machine learning; Multi-armed bandits","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Costs; Learning systems; Budget limitation; Crisis situations; Crowdsourcing; Development and testing; Exploration and exploitation; Multi armed bandit; Product marketing; Quality characteristic; Budget control"

A buffer contains a finite set of items required by some activities, and changing the content of the buffer is costly. For instance, in instruction scheduling, the registers are a buffered resource and any switch of registers has a significant impact on the total runtime of the compiled code. We first show that sequencing activities to minimize the number of switches in the buffer is NP-hard. We then introduce an algorithm which, given a set of already sequenced activities, computes a buffer assignment which minimizes the number of switches in linear time, i.e., O(nd) where n is the length of the sequence and d the number of buffered items. Next, we introduce an algorithm to achieve bound consistency on the constraint Switch, that bounds the number of changes in the buffer, in O(n2 d+n1.5 d1.5) time.

We assume the closing price of each auction is governed by the same unknown distribution, and study the problem of making provably optimal bidding decisions. Learning the distribution is done under censored observations, i.e. the closing price of an auction is revealed only if the bid we place is above it. We consider three algorithms, namely ε-First, Greedy Product- Limit (GPL) and LuekerLearn, respectively, and we show that these algorithms provably achieve Hannan-consistency. In particular, we show that the regret bound of ε-First is at most O(T2/3) with high probability. For the other two algorithms, we first prove that, by using a censored data distribution estimator proposed by Zeng [19], the empirical distribution of the closing market price converges in probability to its true distribution with a O(1/εt) rate, where t is the number of updates. Based on this result, we prove that both GPL and Lueker Learn achieve O(√T) regret bound with high probability. This in fact provides an affirmative answer to the research question raised in [1]. We also evaluate the abovementioned algorithms using real bidding data, and show that although GPL achieves the best performance on average (up to 90% of the optimal solution), its long running time may limit its suitability in practice. By contrast, LuekerLearn and ε-First proposed in this paper achieve up to 85% of the optimal, but with an exponential reduction in computational complexity (a saving up to 95%, compared to GPL).",,"Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Commerce; Costs; Probability; Social networking (online); Censored observations; Empirical distributions; Exponential reduction; High probability; Optimal bidding; Optimal solutions; Research questions; Sponsored search auctions; Probability distributions"

The approach is developed in the setting of possibility theory, since it has been recently pointed out that guaranteed (or strong) possibility measures are a good candidate for modeling graded desires.

It can be used to build a reference anatomy for investigating structural variation or tracking changes in white matter. Unlike traditional scalar image registration where spatial alignment is the only focus, registration of DWI data requires both spatial alignment of structures and reorientation of local signal profiles. As such, DWI registration is much more complex and challenging than scalar image registration. Although a variety of algorithms has been proposed to tackle the problem, most of them are restricted by the diffusion model used for registration, making it difficult to fit to the registered data a different model. In this paper we describe a method that allows any diffusion model to be fitted after registration for subsequent multifaceted analysis. This is achieved by directly aligning DWI data using a large deformation diffeomorphic registration framework. Our algorithm seeks the optimal coordinate mapping by simultaneously considering structural alignment, local signal profile reorientation, and deformation regularization. Our algorithm also incorporates a multi-kernel strategy to concurrently register anatomical structures at different scales. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using in vivo data and report detailed qualitative and quantitative results in comparison with several different registration strategies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Diffeomorphism; Diffusion-weighted imaging; Explicit orientation optimization; Image registration; Signal profile reorientation","Deformation; Image registration; Anatomical structures; Diffeomorphic registrations; Diffeomorphisms; Diffusion weighted imaging; Multifaceted analysis; Quantitative result; Structural alignments; Structural variations; Diffusion; adult; algorithm; anatomy and histology; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; diffusion tensor imaging; female; human; image enhancement; image subtraction; male; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; white matter; Adult; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Male; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique; White Matter"

One of such decision points is the choice between alternative tasks based on trigger conditions regarding a patient's state. It may be the case that, when there is the need to choose one of the alternative tasks, the system does not possess all the required information to do so, thus rendering impossible to reach an outcome.

However, this general class has been little explored from the point of view of its information content, when degrees of uncertainty are not supposed to be numerical, and belong to a finite qualitative scale, except in the case of possibility or necessity measures. The thrust of the paper is to define an ordering relation on the set of qualitative capacities expressing the idea that one is more informative than another, in agreement with the possibilistic notion of relative specificity. To this aim, we show that the class of qualitative capacities can be partitioned into equivalence classes of functions containing the same amount of information. They only differ by the underlying epistemic attitude such as pessimism or optimism. A meaningful information ordering between capacities can be defined on the basis of the most pessimistic (resp. optimistic) representatives of their equivalence classes. It is shown that, while qualitative capacities bear strong similarities to belief functions, such an analogy can be misleading when it comes to information content. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Fuzzy measures; information content; possibility theory; qualitative reasoning","Artificial intelligence; Equivalence classes; Knowledge based systems; Uncertainty analysis; Amount of information; Belief function; Fuzzy measures; Information contents; Necessity measures; Possibility theory; Qualitative reasoning; Qualitative scale; Fuzzy systems"

However, the large appearance and shape variations of the prostate in MR images make the segmentation problem difficult to solve. Traditional Active Shape/Appearance Model (ASM/AAM) has limited accuracy on this problem, since its basic assumption, i.e., both shape and appearance of the targeted organ follow Gaussian distributions, is invalid in prostate MR images. To this end, the authors propose a sparse dictionary learning method to model the image appearance in a nonparametric fashion and further integrate the appearance model into a deformable segmentation framework for prostate MR segmentation. Methods: To drive the deformable model for prostate segmentation, the authors propose nonparametric appearance and shape models. The nonparametric appearance model is based on a novel dictionary learning method, namely distributed discriminative dictionary (DDD) learning, which is able to capture fine distinctions in image appearance. To increase the differential power of traditional dictionary-based classification methods, the authors' DDD learning approach takes three strategies. First, two dictionaries for prostate and nonprostate tissues are built, respectively, using the discriminative features obtained from minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection. Second, linear discriminant analysis is employed as a linear classifier to boost the optimal separation between prostate and nonprostate tissues, based on the representation residuals from sparse representation. Third, to enhance the robustness of the authors' classification method, multiple local dictionaries are learned for local regions along the prostate boundary (each with small appearance variations), instead of learning one global classifier for the entire prostate. These discriminative dictionaries are located on different patches of the prostate surface and trained to adaptively capture the appearance in different prostate zones, thus achieving better local tissue differentiation. For each local region, multiple classifiers are trained based on the randomly selected samples and finally assembled by a specific fusion method. In addition to this nonparametric appearance model, a prostate shape model is learned from the shape statistics using a novel approach, sparse shape composition, which can model nonGaussian distributions of shape variation and regularize the 3D mesh deformation by constraining it within the observed shape subspace. Results: The proposed method has been evaluated on two datasets consisting of T2-weighted MR prostate images. For the first (internal) dataset, the classification effectiveness of the authors' improved dictionary learning has been validated by comparing it with three other variants of traditional dictionary learning methods. The experimental results show that the authors' method yields a Dice Ratio of 89.1% compared to the manual segmentation, which is more accurate than the three state-of-the-art MR prostate segmentation methods under comparison. For the second dataset, the MICCAI 2012 challenge dataset, the authors' proposed method yields a Dice Ratio of 87.4%, which also achieves better segmentation accuracy than other methods under comparison. Conclusions: A new magnetic resonance image prostate segmentation method is proposed based on the combination of deformable model and dictionary learning methods, which achieves more accurate segmentation performance on prostate T2 MR images. © 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","deformable segmentation; magnetic resonance image (MRI); prostate segmentation; sparse dictionary learning","article; book; clinical classification; controlled study; distributed discriminative dictionary learning; ensemble learning; intermethod comparison; machine learning; measurement accuracy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; predictive value; prostate; quantitative analysis; surface property; three dimensional imaging; tissue differentiation; algorithm; artificial intelligence; biological model; computer assisted diagnosis; discriminant analysis; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures; prostate; prostate tumor; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; validation study; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Discriminant Analysis; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models, Biological; Prostate; Prostatic Neoplasms; Sensitivity and Specificity"

By considering the nature of pathological changes, a large number of features related to both local brain regions and interbrain regions can be extracted for classification. However, it is challenging to design a single global classifier to integrate all these features for effective classification, due to the issue of small sample size. To this end, we propose a hierarchical ensemble classification method to combine multilevel classifiers by gradually integrating a large number of features from both local brain regions and interbrain regions. Thus, the large-scale classification problem can be divided into a set of small-scale and easier-to-solve problems in a bottom-up and local-to-global fashion, for more accurate classification. To demonstrate its performance, we use the spatially normalized grey matter (GM) of each MR brain image as imaging features. Specifically, we first partition the whole brain image into a number of local brain regions and, for each brain region, we build two low-level classifiers to transform local imaging features and the inter-region correlations into high-level features. Then, we generate multiple high-level classifiers, with each evaluating the high-level features from the respective brain regions. Finally, we combine the outputs of all high-level classifiers for making a final classification. Our method has been evaluated using the baseline MR images of 652 subjects (including 198 AD patients, 225 MCI patients, and 229 normal controls (NC)) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The experimental results show that our classification method can achieve the accuracies of 92.0% and 85.3% for classifications of AD versus NC and MCI versus NC, respectively, demonstrating very promising classification performance compared to the state-of-the-art classification methods. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Alzheimer's disease; Brain disease diagnosis; Hierarchical classification; Local patch; Mild cognitive impairment (MCI); SVM classifier","aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain region; classification algorithm; classifier; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; female; gray matter; human; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; problem solving; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; artificial intelligence; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; differential diagnosis; factual database; mild cognitive impairment; nonmyelinated nerve; pathology; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; validation study; Aged; Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Databases, Factual; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Nerve Fibers, Unmyelinated; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity"

One of the main features of GPL is that it allows us to explicitly reason about the ignorance of another agent. In this paper, we study two types of approaches for reasoning about ignorance in GPL, based on the idea of minimal specificity and on the notion of guaranteed possibility, respectively.

Such settings are analogous to real-world situations in which people need to decide whether to disclose information such as when negotiating over health plans and business transactions.

We call the projections as canonical representations. By setting the canonical representations as regressors in a sparse least square regression framework and by further penalizing the objective function with a new canonical regularizer on the weight coefficient matrix, we formulate a multi-modality canonical feature selection method. With the help of the canonical information of canonical representations and also a canonical regularizer, the proposed method selects canonical-cross-modality features that are useful for the tasks of clinical scores regression and multi-class disease identification.

We defined a new game called the Contract Game which is analogous to real-world market settings in which participants need to reach agreement over contracts in order to succeed. The game comprises three players, two service providers and one customer. The service providers compete to make repeated contract offers to the customer consisting of resource exchanges in the game. We formally analyzed the game and defined sub-game perfect equilibrium strategies for the customer and service providers that involve commitments. We conducted extensive empirical studies of these strategies in three different countries, the U.S., Israel and China. We ran several configurations in which two human participants played a single agent using the equilibrium strategies in various role configurations in the game (both customer and service providers). Our results showed that the computer agent using equilibrium strategies for the customer role was able to outperform people playing the same role in all three countries.

However, feature selection, which is one of the most important steps in classification, is typically performed separately for each modality, which ignores the potentially strong inter-modality relationship within each subject. Recent emergence of multi-task learning approach makes the joint feature selection from different modalities possible. However, joint feature selection may unfortunately overlook different yet complementary information conveyed by different modalities. We propose a novel multi-task feature selection method to preserve the complementary inter-modality information. Specifically, we treat feature selection from each modality as a separate task and further impose a constraint for preserving the inter-modality relationship, besides separately enforcing the sparseness of the selected features from each modality. After feature selection, a multi-kernel support vector machine (SVM) is further used to integrate the selected features from each modality for classification. Our method is evaluated using the baseline PET and MRI images of subjects obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our method achieves a good performance, with an accuracy of 94.37% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9724 for AD identification, and also an accuracy of 78.80% and an AUC of 0.8284 for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) identification. Moreover, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 67.83% and an AUC of 0.6957 for separating between MCI converters and MCI non-converters (to AD). These performances demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art classification methods. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Alzheimer's Disease; Inter-modality relationship; Mild cognitive impairment; Multi-kernel support vector machine; Multi-task feature selection","aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain region; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; false positive result; female; human; image analysis; intermethod comparison; kernel method; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; mild cognitive impairment; multitask feature selection method; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; support vector machine; validation process; Alzheimer disease; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; differential diagnosis; image enhancement; middle aged; mild cognitive impairment; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Artificial Intelligence; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Positron-Emission Tomography; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity"

In the disjunctive reading, a set contains mutually exclusive elements and refers to the representation of incomplete knowledge. It does not model an actual object or quantity, but partial information about an underlying object or a precise quantity. This distinction between what we call ontic vs. epistemic sets remains valid for fuzzy sets, whose membership functions, in the disjunctive reading are possibility distributions, over deterministic or random values. This paper examines the impact of this distinction in statistics. We show its importance because there is a risk of misusing basic notions and tools, such as conditioning, distance between sets, variance, regression, etc. when data are set-valued.

Typically, label fusion can be formulated either as a reconstruction or as a classification problem. Reconstruction-based methods compute the target labels as a weighted average of the atlas labels. Such weights are derived from the representation of the target image patches as a linear combination of the atlas image patches. However, the related issue is that the optimal weights in the image domain are not necessarily corresponding to those in the label domain. Classification-based methods can avoid this issue by directly learning the relationship between image and label domains. However, the learned relationships, describing the common characteristics of all the training atlas patches, might not be representative for a particular target image patch, and thus undermine the labeling results. In order to overcome the limitations of both types of methods, we innovatively formulate the patch-based label fusion problem as a matrix completion problem. By doing so, we can jointly utilize (1) the relationships between atlas and target image patches (thus taking the advantage of the reconstruction-based methods), and (2) the relationships between image and label domains (taking the advantage of the classification-based methods). In this way, our generalized paradigm can improve the label fusion accuracy in segmenting the challenging structures, e.g., hippocampus, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computers; Classification based methods; Generalized paradigms; Linear combinations; Matrix completion; Matrix completion problems; Optimal weight; State-of-the-art methods; Weighted averages; Image segmentation"

The rationale for our approach is that it is likely for neuroimaging data to have multiple peaks or modes in distribution due to the inter-subject variability. In this regard, we use a clustering method to discover the multipeak distributional characteristics and define subclasses based on the clustering results, in which each cluster covers a peak. We then encode the respective subclasses, i.e., clusters, with their unique codes by imposing the subclasses of the same original class close to each other and those of different original classes L2,1-penalized regression framework by taking the codes as new label vectors of our training samples, through which we select features for classification.

Broadly, there are two different approaches in reducing the feature dimensionality: feature selection and subspace learning. When it comes to the feature interpretability, the feature selection approach such as the sparse regularized linear regression method is preferable to the subspace learning methods, especially in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) diagnosis. However, based on recent machine learning researches, the subspace learning methods presented promising results in various applications. To this end, in this work, we propose a novel method for discriminative feature selection by combining two conceptually different methodologies of feature selection and subspace learning in a unified framework. Specifically, we integrate the ideas of Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis and locality preserving projection, which consider, respectively, the global and local information inherent in observations, in a regularized least square regression model. With the help of global and local information in data, we select classdiscriminative and noise-resistant features that thus help enhance classification performance. Furthermore, unlike the previous methods that mostly considered only a binary classification, in this paper, we consider a multi-class classification problem in AD diagnosis.

Accurate and consistent parcellation of longitudinal dynamic cortical surfaces during this critical stage is essential to understand the early development of cortical structure and function in both normal and high-risk infant brains. However, directly applying the existing methods developed for the cross-sectional studies often generates longitudinally-inconsistent results, thus leading to inaccurate measurements of the cortex development. In this paper, we propose a new method for accurate, consistent, and simultaneous labeling of longitudinal cortical surfaces in the serial infant brain MR images. The proposed method is explicitly formulated as a minimization problem with an energy function that includes a data fitting term, a spatial smoothness term, and a temporal consistency term. Specifically, inspired by multi-atlas based label fusion, the data fitting term is designed to integrate the contributions from multi-atlas surfaces adaptively, according to the similarities of their local cortical folding with that of the subject cortical surface. The spatial smoothness term is then designed to adaptively encourage label smoothness based on the local cortical folding geometries, i.e., allowing label discontinuity at sulcal bottoms (which often are the boundaries of cytoarchitecturally and functionally distinct regions). The temporal consistency term is to adaptively encourage the label consistency among the temporally-corresponding vertices, based on their similarity of local cortical folding. Finally, the entire energy function is efficiently minimized by a graph cuts method. The proposed method has been applied to the parcellation of longitudinal cortical surfaces of 13 healthy infants, each with 6 serial MRI scans acquired at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18. months of age. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrated both accuracy and longitudinal consistency of the proposed method. By using our method, for the first time, we reveal several hitherto unseen properties of the dynamic and regionally heterogeneous development of the cortical surface area in the first 18. months of life. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Cortical surface; Early brain development; Infant; Longitudinal analysis; Parcellation","Data handling; Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Brain development; Cortical surfaces; Infant; Longitudinal analysis; Parcellation; Brain; aging; algorithm; anatomy and histology; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; brain cortex; computer assisted diagnosis; documentation; female; growth, development and aging; human; image enhancement; image subtraction; infant; longitudinal study; male; newborn; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Aging; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cerebral Cortex; Documentation; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique"

However, it is a challenge to decide which agents to pick when forming multi-agent teams. In some scenarios, agents coordinate by voting continuously. When forming such teams, should we focus on the diversity of the team or on the strength of each member? Can a team of diverse (and weak) agents outperform a uniform team of strong agents? We propose a new model to address these questions. Our key contributions include: (i) we show that a diverse team can overcome a uniform team and we give the necessary conditions for it to happen; (ii) we present optimal voting rules for a diverse team; (iii) we perform synthetic experiments that demonstrate that both diversity and strength contribute to the performance of a team; (iv) we show experiments that demonstrate the usefulness of our model in one of the most difficult challenges for Artificial Intelligence: Computer Go. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","Coordination and collaboration; Distributed AI; Multi-agent systems","Data privacy; Experiments; Intelligent agents; Multi agent systems; Network security; Open systems; Computer Go; Coordination and collaboration; Distributed AI; Multiagent teams; Synthetic experiments; Voting rules; Societies and institutions"

Motivated by task allocation in disaster response, we extend standard DCOP models to consider uncertain task rewards where the outcome of completing a task depends on its current state, which is randomly drawn from unknown distributions. The goal of solving this problem is to find a solution for all agents that minimizes the overall worst-case loss. This is a challenging problem for centralized algorithms because the search space grows exponentially with the number of agents and is nontrivial for existing algorithms for standard DCOPs. To address this, we propose a novel decentralized algorithm that incorporates Max-Sum with iterative constraint generation to solve the problem by passing messages among agents. By so doing, our approach scales well and can solve instances of the task allocation problem with hundreds of agents and tasks.

In such tariffs, a customer is asked in advance to predict her future consumption, and is charged based both on her actual consumption and the deviation from her prediction. Prior work (Vinyals et al. 2014) studied the cost game induced by a single such tariff, and showed customers would have an incentive to minimize their risk, by joining together when buying electricity as a grand coalition.

In this paper, we propose the first study of factored π-MOMDP models in order to solve large structured planning problems under qualitative uncertainty, or considered as qualitative approximations of probabilistic problems. Building upon the SPUDD algorithm for solving factored (probabilistic) MDPs, we conceived a symbolic algorithm named PPUDD for solving factored π-MOMDPs.

The need to save energy becomes even greater when considering an electric car, since heavy use of the climate control system may exhaust the battery. In this paper we consider a method for an automated agent to provide advice to drivers which will motivate them to reduce the energy consumption of their climate control unit.Our approach takes into account both the energy consumption of the climate control system and the expected comfort level of the driver. We therefore build two models, one for assessing the energy consumption of the climate control system as a function of the system's settings, and the other, models human comfort level as a function of the climate control system's settings. Using these models, the agent provides advice to the driver considering how to set the climate control system. The agent advises settings which try to preserve a high level of comfort while consuming as little energy as possible. We empirically show that drivers equipped with our agent which provides them with advice significantly save energy as compared to drivers not equipped with our agent.

Concerning the size of the diverse team, we show that the performance converges exponentially fast to the optimal one as we increase the number of agents. We present synthetic experiments that allow us to gain further insights: even though a diverse team outperforms a uniform team when the size of the action space increases, the uniform team will eventually again play better than the diverse team for a large enough action space.

We then leverage our findings to develop an automated investor agent that performs as well as or better than humans in these games. To gather this data, we extended Berg's game and conducted a series of experiments using Amazon's Mechanical Turk to determine how humans be-have in these potentially adversarial conditions. Our results indicate that, in games of short duration, advisors do not stimulate positive behavior and are not useful in providing actionable advice. In long-term interactions, however, advisors do stimulate positive behavior with significantly increased investments and returns. By modeling human behavior across several hundred participants, we were then able to develop agent strategies that maximized return on investment and performed as well as or significantly better than humans. In one-shot games, we identified an ideal investment value that, on average, resulted in positive returns as long as advisor exploitation was not allowed. For the multi-round games, our agents relied on the corrective presence of advisors to stimulate positive returns on maximum investment.

In this paper, we present STREETS, an application developed for the city of Singapore, which models the problem of computing randomized traffic patrol strategies as a defender- Attacker Stackelberg game. Previous work on Stackel- berg security games has focused extensively on counter- terrorism settings. STREETS moves beyond counter- terrorism and represents the first use of Stackelberg games for traffic patrolling, in the process providing a novel algorithm for solving such games that addresses three major challenges in modeling and scale-up. First, there exists a high degree of unpredictability in travel times through road networks, which we capture using a Markov Decision Process for planning the patrols of the defender (the police) in the game. Second, modeling all possible police patrols and their interactions with a large number of adversaries (drivers) introduces a significant scalability challenge. To address this challenge we apply a compact game representation in a novel fashion combined with adversary and state sampling. Third, patrol strategies must balance exploitation (minimizing violations) with exploration (maximizing omnipresence), a tradeoff we model by solving a bi- objective optimization problem.

In traditional Stackelberg security game models the attacker knows only the probability that each target is covered by the defender, but is oblivious to the detailed timing of the coverage schedule. In many real-world situations, however, the attacker can observe the current location of the defender and can exploit this knowledge to reason about the defender's future moves. We show that this general modeling framework can be captured using adversarial patrolling games (APGs) in which the defender sequentially moves between targets, with moves constrained by a graph, while the attacker can observe the defender's current location and his (stochastic) policy concerning future moves. We offer a very general model of infinite-horizon discounted adversarial patrolling games. Our first contribution is to show that defender policies that condition only on the previous defense move (i.e., Markov stationary policies) can be arbitrarily sub-optimal for general APGs. We then offer a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation for computing optimal randomized policies for the defender that can condition on history of bounded, but arbitrary, length, as well as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation to approximate these, with provable quality guarantees. Addi-tionally, we present a non-linear programming (NLP) formu-lation for solving zero-sum APGs. We show experimentally that MILP significantly outperforms the MINLP formulation, and is, in turn, significantly outperformed by the NLP spe-cialized to zero-sum games.

We address this gap by providing an agent design that outperforms other voters in groups comprising both people and computer agents. In our setting participants vote by simultaneously submitting a ranking over a set of candidates and the election system uses a social welfare rule to select a ranking that minimizes disagreements with participants' votes. We ran an extensive study in which hundreds of people participated in repeated voting rounds with other people as well as computer agents that differed in how they employ strategic reasoning in their voting behavior. Our results show that over time, people learn to deviate from truthful voting strategies, and use heuristics to guide their play, such as repeating their vote from the previous round. We show that a computer agent using a best response voting strategy was able to outperform people in the game.

This paper presents a novel agent design for repeated negotiation in incomplete information settings that learns to reveal information strategically during the negotiation process. The agent used classical machine learning techniques to predict how people make and respond to offers during the negotiation, how the y reveal information and their response to potential revelation actions by the agent. The agent was evaluated empirically in an extensive empirical study spanning hundreds of human subjects. Results show that the agent was able to outperform people. In particular, it learned (1) to make offers that were beneficial to people while not compromising its own benefit; (2) to incrementally reveal information to people in a way that increased its expected performance.

Recently, multi-modality methods have been used for fusing information from multiple different and complementary imaging and non-imaging modalities. Although there are a number of existing multi-modality methods, few of them have addressed the problem of joint identification of disease-related brain regions from multi-modality data for classification. In this paper, we proposed a manifold regularized multi-task learning framework to jointly select features from multi-modality data. Specifically, we formulate the multi-modality classification as a multi-task learning framework, where each task focuses on the classification based on each modality. In order to capture the intrinsic relatedness among multiple tasks (i.e., modalities), we adopted a group sparsity regularizer, which ensures only a small number of features to be selected jointly. In addition, we introduced a new manifold based Laplacian regularization term to preserve the geometric distribution of original data from each task, which can lead to the selection of more discriminative features. Furthermore, we extend our method to the semi-supervised setting, which is very important since the acquisition of a large set of labeled data (i.e., diagnosis of disease) is usually expensive and time-consuming, while the collection of unlabeled data is relatively much easier. To validate our method, we have performed extensive evaluations on the baseline Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

Based on CS theory, a suitable dictionary for sparse representation of the signal is required. In diffusion MRI (dMRI), CS methods proposed for reconstruction of diffusion-weighted signal and the Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP) utilize two kinds of Dictionary Learning (DL) methods: 1) Discrete Representation DL (DR-DL), and 2) Continuous Representation DL (CR-DL). DR-DL is susceptible to numerical inaccuracy owing to interpolation and regridding errors in a discretized q-space. In this paper, we propose a novel CR-DL approach, called Dictionary Learning - Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging (DL-SPFI) for effective compressed-sensing reconstruction of the q-space diffusion-weighted signal and the EAP. In DL-SPFI, a dictionary that sparsifies the signal is learned from the space of continuous Gaussian diffusion signals. The learned dictionary is then adaptively applied to different voxels using a weighted LASSO framework for robust signal reconstruction. Compared with the start-of-the-art CR-DL and DR-DL methods proposed by Merlet et al. and Bilgic et al., respectively, our work offers the following advantages. First, the learned dictionary is proved to be optimal for Gaussian diffusion signals. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first work to learn a voxel-adaptive dictionary. The importance of the adaptive dictionary in EAP reconstruction will be demonstrated theoretically and empirically. Third, optimization in DL-SPFI is only performed in a small subspace resided by the SPF coefficients, as opposed to the q-space approach utilized by Merlet et al.

Our goal is to quantify the loss incurred by miscoordination between defenders, both theoretically and empirically.

It usually arises when conflicting interests among agents exist, and one of the agents wishes to sway the opinions of others. This paper considers the problem of an automated agent that needs to influence the decision of a group of self-interested agents that must reach an agreement on a joint action. For example, consider an automated agent that aims to reduce the energy consumption of a nonresidential building, by convincing a group of people who share an office to agree on an economy mode of the air-conditioning and low light intensity. In this paper we present four problems that address issues of minimality and safety of the persuasion process. We discuss the relationships to similar problems from social choice, and show that if the agents are using Plurality or Veto as their voting rule all of our problems are in P. We also show that with K-Approval, Bucklin and Borda voting rules some problems become intractable.

This work proposes a method for predicting people's strategic decisions based on their facial expressions. We designed a new version of the centipede game that intorduces an incentive for the human participant to hide her facial expressions. We recorded on video participants who played several games of our centipede version, and concurrently logged their decisions throughout the games. The video snippet of the participants' faces prior to their decisions is represented as a fixed-size vector by estimating the covariance matrix of key facial points which change over time. This vector serves as input to a classifier that is trained to predict the participant's decision. We compare several training techniques, all of which are designed to work with the imbalanced decisions typically made by the players of the game. Furthermore, we investigate adaptation of the trained model to each player individually, while taking into account the player's facial expressions in the previous games. The results show that our method outperforms standard SVM as well as humans in predicting subjects' strategic decisions.

To address this problem, we propose a novel navigation system, which communicates its intentions (i.e., routing policies) to other drivers. Using these intentions, our system accurately predicts congestion at charging stations and suggests the most efficient route to its user. We achieve this by extending existing time-dependent stochastic routing algorithms to include the battery's state of charge and charging stations. Furthermore, we describe a novel technique for combining historical information with agent intentions to predict the queues at charging stations.

Although many automatic segmentation methods have been developed, their performances are still challenged by the poor image contrast of hippocampus in the MR images acquired especially from 1.5 or 3.0Tesla (T) scanners. With the recent advance of imaging technology, 7.0T scanner provides much higher image contrast and resolution for hippocampus study. However, the previous methods developed for segmentation of hippocampus from 1.5T or 3.0T images do not work for the 7.0T images, due to different levels of imaging contrast and texture information. In this paper, we present a learning-based algorithm for automatic segmentation of hippocampi from 7.0T images, by taking advantages of the state-of-the-art multi-atlas framework and also the auto-context model (ACM). Specifically, ACM is performed in each atlas domain to iteratively construct sequences of location-adaptive classifiers by integrating both image appearance and local context features. Due to the plenty texture information in 7.0T images, more advanced texture features are also extracted and incorporated into the ACM during the training stage. Then, under the multi-atlas segmentation framework, multiple sequences of ACM-based classifiers are trained for all atlases to incorporate the anatomical variability. In the application stage, for a new image, its hippocampus segmentation can be achieved by fusing the labeling results from all atlases, each of which is obtained by applying the atlas-specific ACM-based classifiers. Experimental results on twenty 7.0T images with the voxel size of 0.35×0.35×0.35mm3 show very promising hippocampus segmentations (in terms of Dice overlap ratio 89.1±0.020), indicating high applicability for the future clinical and neuroscience studies. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","7.0T MRI; Auto-context model; Automatic hippocampus segmentation; Label fusion; Multiple atlases based segmentation","adult; article; automatic segmentation algorithm; classifier; clinical article; contrast enhancement; controlled study; experimental study; female; hippocampus; human; image display; image processing; image quality; learning algorithm; male; neuroscience; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; statistical model; algorithm; anatomy and histology; artificial intelligence; audiovisual equipment; automated pattern recognition; biological model; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; hippocampus; image enhancement; image subtraction; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; Adult; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models, Anatomic; Models, Neurological; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique"

We propose an alternative method of distribution (to standard road delivery) in which the existing mobility habits of a local population are leveraged to deliver aid, which raises two technical challenges in the areas optimisation and learning. For optimisation, a standard Markov decision process applied to this problem is intractable, so we provide an exact formulation that takes advantage of the periodicities in human location behaviour. To learn such behaviour models from sparse data (i.e., cell tower observations), we develop a Bayesian model of human mobility. Using real cell tower data of the mobility behaviour of 50,000 individuals in Ivory Coast, we find that our model outperforms the state of the art approaches in mobility prediction by at least 25% (in held-out data likelihood). Furthermore, when incorporating mobility prediction with our MDP approach, we find a 81.3% reduction in total delivery time versus routine planning that minimises just the number of participants in the solution path.",,"Behaviour models; Human behaviours; Local populations; Markov Decision Processes; Mobility predictions; Rural locations; State-of-the-art approach; Technical challenges; Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Developing countries; Markov processes; Optimization; Behavioral research"

However, like probabilistic POMDPs, optimally solving π-POMDPs is intractable: the finite belief state space exponentially grows with the number of system's states. In this paper, a possibilistic version of Mixed-Observable MDPs is presented to get around this issue: the complexity of solving π-POMDPs, some state variables of which are fully observable, can be then dramatically reduced. A value iteration algorithm for this new formulation under infinite horizon is next proposed and the optimality of the returned policy (for a specified criterion) is shown assuming the existence of a ""stay"" action in some goal states.

Several three-valued logics have been defined. They differ by their choice of basic connectives, hence also from a syntactic and proof-theoretic point of view. Different interpretations of the third truth value have also been suggested. They often carry an epistemic flavor. In this work, relationships between logical connectives on three-valued functions are explored. Existing theorems of functional completeness have laid bare some of these links, based on specific connectives. However we try to draw a map of such relationships between conjunctions, negations and implications that extend Boolean ones. It turns out that all reasonable connectives can be defined from a few of them and so all known three-valued logics appear as a fragment of only one logic. These results can be instrumental when choosing, for each application context, the appropriate fragment where the basic connectives make full sense, based on the appropriate meaning of the third truth-value. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A key challenge in DCP systems is how to coordinate activities for a group of planning agents. This problem is compounded when these agents are situated in a real-world dynamic domain where the agents often encounter differing, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment. To date, DCP systems have only focused on cases where agents' behavior is designed to optimize a global plan. In contrast, this paper presents a temporal reasoning mechanism for self-interested planning agents. To do so, we model agents' behavior based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) theoretical model of cooperation, while modeling dynamic joint plans with group time constraints through creating hierarchical abstraction plans integrated with temporal constraints network. The contribution of this paper is threefold: (i) the BDI model specifies a behavior for self interested agents working in a group, permitting an individual agent to schedule its activities in an autonomous fashion, while taking into consideration temporal constraints of its group members; (ii) abstract plans allow the group to plan a joint action without explicitly describing all possible states in advance, making it possible to reduce the number of states which need to be considered in a BDI-based approach; and (iii) a temporal constraints network enables each agent to reason by itself about the best time for scheduling activities, making it possible to reduce coordination messages among a group. The mechanism ensures temporal consistency of a cooperative plan, enables the interleaving of planning and execution at both individual and group levels. We report on how the mechanism was implemented within a commercial training and simulation application, and present empirical evidence of its effectiveness in real-life scenarios and in reducing communication to coordinate group members' activities. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Artificial intelligence; Cooperation; Coordination; Multiagent system; Planning; Time constraints",

However, DMRI suffers from insufficient spatial resolution, often limiting its utility to the studying of only major white matter structures. Many image enhancement techniques rely on expensive scanner upgrades and complex time-consuming sequences. We will instead take a post-processing approach in this paper for resolution enhancement of DMRI data. This will allow the enhancement of existing data without re-acquisition. Our method uses a generative model that reflects the image generation process and, after the parameters of the model have been estimated, we can effectively sample high-resolution images from this model. More specifically, we assume that the diffusion-weighted signal at each voxel is an agglomeration of signals from an ensemble of fiber segments that can be oriented and located freely within the voxel. Our model for each voxel therefore consists of an arbitrary number of signal generating fiber segments, and the model parameters that need to be determined are the locations and orientations of these fiber segments. Solving for these parameters is an ill-posed problem. However, by borrowing information from neighboring voxels, we show that this can be solved by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Preliminary results indicate that out method substantially increases structural visibility in both subcortical and cortical regions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",,"Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging; High resolution image; Image generations; Markov chain Monte Carlo method; Metropolis-Hastings algorithm; Resolution enhancement; Spatial resolution; White matter connectivities; Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging; High resolution image; Image generations; Markov chain Monte Carlo method; Metropolis-Hastings algorithm; Resolution enhancement; Spatial resolution; White matter connectivities; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Diffusion; Magnetic resonance imaging; Markov processes; Medical computing; Monte Carlo methods; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging"

Although many hand-engineered features have been proposed for correspondence detection in various registration applications, no features are general enough to work well for all image data. Although many learning-based methods have been developed to help selection of best features for guiding correspondence detection across subjects with large anatomical variations, they are often limited by requiring the known correspondences (often presumably estimated by certain registration methods) as the ground truth for training. To address this limitation, we propose using an unsupervised deep learning approach to directly learn the basis filters that can effectively represent all observed image patches. Then, the coefficients by these learnt basis filters in representing the particular image patch can be regarded as the morphological signature for correspondence detection during image registration. Specifically, a stacked two-layer convolutional network is constructed to seek for the hierarchical representations for each image patch, where the high-level features are inferred from the responses of the low-level network. By replacing the hand-engineered features with our learnt data-adaptive features for image registration, we achieve promising registration results, which demonstrates that a general approach can be built to improve image registration by using data-adaptive features through unsupervised deep learning. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",,"Anatomical variations; Convolutional networks; Correspondence detection; Deep feature learning; Deformable registration; Hierarchical representation; Learning-based methods; Morphological signatures; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Image registration"

To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop and apply novel predictive models of resting state networks (RSNs) learned from multimodal resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) and DTI data to assess large-scale FC alterations in MCI. Our rationale is that some RSNs in MCI are substantially altered and can hardly be directly compared with those in NC. Instead, structural landmarks derived from DTI data are much more consistent and correspondent across MCI/NC brains, and therefore can be employed to encode RSNs in NC and serve as the predictive models of RSNs for MCI. To derive these predictive models, RSNs in NC are constructed by group-wise ICA clustering and employed to functionally annotate corresponding structural landmarks. Afterwards, these functionally-annotated structural landmarks are predicted in MCI based on DTI data and used to assess FC alterations in MCI. Experimental results demonstrated that the predictive models of RSNs are effective and can comprehensively reveal widespread FC alterations in MCI. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","functional connectivity (FC); mild cognitive impairment (MCI); predictive models; resting state networks","Brain networks; Functional connectivity; Mild cognitive impairments (MCI); Multi-modal; Normal controls; Predictive models; Resting state; Resting-state fmri; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Tensors"

Each agent has a non-increasing marginal valuation function for the resource, and an upper limit on the number of units that can be allocated in any period. We propose two versions on a truthful allocation mechanism. Each modifies the decisions of a greedy online assignment algorithm by sometimes cancelling an allocation of resources. One version makes this modification immediately upon an allocation decision while a second waits until the point at which an agent departs the market. Adopting a prior-free framework, we show that the second approach has better worst-case allocative efficiency and is more scalable. On the other hand, the first approach (with immediate cancellation) may be easier in practice because it does not need to reclaim units previously allocated. We consider an application to recharging plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Using data from a real-world trial of PHEVs in the UK, we demonstrate higher system performance than a fixed price system, performance comparable with a standard, but non-truthful scheduling heuristic, and the ability to support 50% more vehicles at the same fuel cost than a simple randomized policy. © 2013 AI Access Foundation.",,"Allocation decision; Allocation mechanism; Allocative efficiency; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Randomized policies; Scheduling heuristics; Valuation function; Artificial intelligence; Resource valuation"

Specifically we build on a previous approach to stress estimation from the analysis of interaction and behavioural patterns. From the data gathered in a previous experiment we now trained classifiers that allow to assess stress in real-time, in a personalized and empirical way.

In case of binary attributes it captures specific partial orderings over Boolean interpretations where strict preference statements are defined between interpretations which differ by a single flip of an attribute value. It respects preferential independence encoded by the ceteris paribus property. The popularity of this approach has motivated some comparison with other preference representation setting such as possibilistic logic. In this paper, we focus our discussion on the possibilistic representation of CP-nets, and the question whether it is possible to capture the CP-net partial order over interpretations by means of a possibilistic knowledge base and a suitable semantics. We show that several results in the literature on the alleged faithful representation of CP-nets by possibilistic bases are questionable. To this aim we discuss some canonical examples of CP-net topologies where the considered possibilistic approach fails to exactly capture the partial order induced by CP-nets, thus shedding light on the difficulties encountered when trying to reconcile the two frameworks. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Attribute values; Binary attributes; Conditional preferences; Graphical representations; Possibilistic approach; Possibilistic logic; Preference representation; Preference statements; Artificial intelligence; Knowledge based systems; Semantics; Bayesian networks"

More specifically, we investigate the question whether these qualitative set-functions can be viewed as classes of simpler set-functions, typically possibility measures, paralleling the situation of quantitative capacities with respect to imprecise probability theory. We show that any capacity is characterized by a non-empty class of possibility measures having the structure of an upper semi-lattice. The lower bounds of this class are enough to reconstruct the capacity, and their number is characteristic of its complexity. We introduce a sequence of axioms generalizing the maxitivity property of possibility measures, and related to the number of possibility measures needed for this reconstruction.

In this paper, we study from a formal perspective representations of multiset variables, and the consistency and propagation of constraints involving multiset variables. These help us model problems more naturally and can, for example, prevent introducing unnecessary symmetries into a model. We identify a number of different representations for multiset variables, compare them in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, and propose inference rules to enforce bounds consistency for the representations. In addition, we propose to exploit the variety of a multiset - the number of distinct elements in it - to improve modeling expressiveness and further enhance constraint propagation. We derive a number of inference rules involving the varieties of multiset variables. The rules interact varieties with the traditional components of multiset variables (such as cardinalities) to obtain stronger propagation. We also demonstrate how to apply the rules to perform variety reasoning on some common multiset constraints. Experimental results show that performing variety reasoning on top of cardinality reasoning can effectively reduce more search space and achieve better runtime in solving some multiset CSPs. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Constraint satisfaction; Multiset variables","Bounds consistency; Constraint propagation; Constraint Satisfaction; Distinct elements; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Inference rules; Modeling expressiveness; Multiset; Artificial intelligence; Constraint theory; Constraint satisfaction problems"

In this paper, we propose a novel graph matching method to augment its power in establishing anatomical correspondences in medical images, especially for the cases with large inter-subject variations. Our contributions have twofold. First, we propose a robust measurement to characterize the pairwise agreement of appearance information on each graph link. In this way, our method is more robust to ambiguous matches than the conventional graph matching methods that generally consider only the simple geometric information. Second, although multiple correspondences are allowed for robust correspondence, we further introduce the sparsity constraint upon the possibilities of correspondences to suppress the distraction from misleading matches, which is very important for achieving accurate one-to-one correspondences in the end of the matching procedure. We finally incorporate these two improvements into a new objective function and solve it by quadratic programming. The proposed graph matching method has been evaluated in the public hand X-ray images with comparison to a conventional graph matching method. In all experiments, our method achieves the best matching performance in terms of matching accuracy and robustness. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",,"Correspondence detection; Geometric information; Graph matchings; Graph-matching methods; Medical images; Objective functions; Robust measurement; Sparsity constraints; Artificial intelligence; Medical imaging"

Effective connectivity provides specific dynamic temporal information of R-fMRI time series and reflects the directional causal influence of one brain region over another. These causal influences among brain regions are normally extracted based on the concept of Granger causality. Conventionally, the effective connectivity is inferred using multivariate autoregressive (MAR) modeling with default model order q = 1, considering low frequency fluctuation of R-fMRI time series. This assumption, although reduces the modeling complexity, does not guarantee the best fitting of R-fMRI time series at different brain regions. Instead of using the default model order, we propose to estimate the optimal model order based upon MAR order distribution to better characterize these causal influences at each brain region. Due to sparse nature of brain connectivity networks, an orthogonal least square (OLS) regression algorithm is incorporated to MAR modeling to minimize spurious effective connectivity. Effective connectivity networks inferred using the proposed optimal sparse MAR modeling are applied to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) identification and obtained promising results, demonstrating the importance of using optimal causal relationships between brain regions for neurodegeneration disorder identification.",,"aged; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; automated pattern recognition; brain; brain mapping; computer assisted diagnosis; connectome; female; human; image enhancement; male; methodology; mild cognitive impairment; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; regression analysis; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical analysis; Aged; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Brain Mapping; Connectome; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Nerve Net; Neural Networks (Computer); Pattern Recognition, Automated; Regression Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity"

Such a problem has a wide variety of practical applications, ranging from matching resident doctors to hospitals, to matching students to schools or more generally to any two-sided market. In the classical stable marriage problem, both men and women express a strict preference order over the members of the other sex, in a qualitative way. Here we consider stable marriage problems with weighted preferences: each man (resp., woman) provides a score for each woman (resp., man). Such problems are more expressive than the classical stable marriage problems. Moreover, in some real-life situations it is more natural to express scores (to model, for example, profits or costs) rather than a qualitative preference ordering. In this context, we define new notions of stability and optimality, and we provide algorithms to find marriages which are stable and/or optimal according to these notions. While expressivity greatly increases by adopting weighted preferences, we show that in most cases the desired solutions can be found by adapting existing algorithms for the classical stable marriage problem. We also investigate manipulation issues in our framework. More precisely, we adapt the classical notion of manipulation to our context and we study if the procedures which return the new kinds of stable marriages are manipulable. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Stable marriages; Weighted preferences","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Optimization; Classical stable marriages; Matching problems; Optimality; Preference order; Stable marriage problem; Stable marriages; Two-sided markets; Weighted preferences; Game theory"

Following this strategy, we first predict transformations at selected key points, and retain multiple predictions on each key point (instead of allowing a single correspondence only).

Although many hand-engineered features have been proposed for correspondence detection in various registration applications, no features are general enough to work well for all image data. Although many learning-based methods have been developed to help selection of best features for guiding correspondence detection across subjects with large anatomical variations, they are often limited by requiring the known correspondences (often presumably estimated by certain registration methods) as the ground truth for training. To address this limitation, we propose using an unsupervised deep learning approach to directly learn the basis filters that can effectively represent all observed image patches. Then, the coefficients by these learnt basis filters in representing the particular image patch can be regarded as the morphological signature for correspondence detection during image registration. Specifically, a stacked two-layer convolutional network is constructed to seek for the hierarchical representations for each image patch, where the high-level features are inferred from the responses of the low-level network. By replacing the hand-engineered features with our learnt data-adaptive features for image registration, we achieve promising registration results, which demonstrates that a general approach can be built to improve image registration by using data-adaptive features through unsupervised deep learning.",,"algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; histology; human; image enhancement; image subtraction; information retrieval; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique"

The projected features, instead of only voxel-wise intensity, will be served as anatomical signature of each voxel. Second, based on the projected features, a new multi-atlases sparse label fusion framework is proposed to estimate the prostate likelihood of each voxel in the target image from the coarse level. Third, a domain-specific semi-supervised manifold regularization method is proposed to incorporate the most reliable patient-specific information identified by the prostate likelihood map to refine the segmentation result from the fine level.

However, it's believed that the geometrical relation among target vectors in the training set may provide useful information, and it would be natural to expect that the predicted vectors have similar geometric relations as the target vectors. To overcome these limitations, we formulate this as a graph-matching feature selection problem between a predicted graph and a target graph. In the predicted graph a node is represented by predicted vector that may describe regional gray matter volume or cortical thickness features, and in the target graph a node is represented by target vector that include class label and clinical scores. In particular, we devise new regularization terms in sparse representation to impose high-order graph matching between the target vectors and the predicted ones. Finally, the selected regional gray matter volume and cortical thickness features are fused in kernel space for classification.

However, such features are not designed with the guidance of the underlying dataset at hand. To this end, we argue that the most effective features should be designed in a learning based manner, namely representation learning, which can be adapted to different patient datasets at hand. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework to achieve this goal. Specifically, a stacked independent subspace analysis (ISA) network is adopted to learn the most effective features in a hierarchical and unsupervised manner. The learnt features are adapted to the dataset at hand and encode high level semantic anatomical information.

It is important to first model this diffusion in order to recommend actions or patrol policies to control the diffusion of such crime. Previously, game theory has been used for such patrol policy recommendations, but these applications of game theory for security have not modeled the diffusion of crime that comes about due to criminals seeking opportunities; instead the focus has been on highly strategic adversaries that plan attacks in advance. To overcome this limitation of previous work, this paper provides the following key contributions. First, we provide a model of crime diffusion based on a quantal biased random movement (QBRM) of criminals opportunistically and repeatedly seeking targets. Within this model, criminals react to real-time information, rather than strategically planning their attack in advance.

They take orders from customers throughout the day and have to allocate one of the vehicles of their fleet to best meet the demand. This decision takes into account a number of hard (e.g. a vehicle must have capacity available for a parcel to be transported, a parcel is picked up and delivered by the same vehicle, a vehicle must wait if it arrives earlier then requested) and soft (e.g. a delivery that occurs outside a given time interval is penalized) constraints. The system we implemented to manage this Online Pickup and Delivery Problem (OPDP) selects an appropriate heuristic to decide the allocation of parcels to vehicles based on previously collected real data from the company. To verify the system working process we are proposing a novel combination of machine learning and optimisation where optimisation is used post hoc to measure the quality of these decisions.

Recent studies have shown that recommender systems have a positive effect on the provider's revenue. In this paper we show that by giving a different set of recommendations, the recommendation system can further increase the business' utility (e.g. revenue), without any significant drop in user satisfaction. Indeed, the recommendation system designer should have in mind both the user, whose taste we need to reveal, and the business, which wants to promote specific content. In order to study these questions, we performed a large body of experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In each of the experiments, we compare a commercial state-of-the-art recommendation engine with a modified recommendation list, which takes into account the utility (or revenue) which the business obtains from each suggestion that is accepted by the user. We show that the modified recommendation list is more desirable for the business, as the end result gives the business a higher utility (or revenue). To study possible longterm effects of giving the user worse suggestions, we asked the users how they perceive the list of recommendation that they received. Our findings are that any difference in user satisfaction between the list is negligible, and not statistically significant. We also uncover a phenomenon where movie consumers prefer watching and even paying for movies that they have already seen in the past than movies that are new to them.

It is attractive for its usually modest memory requirements and impressive running times. In this paper we give a first analysis of TRANSIT routing on a set of popular grid-based video-game benchmarks taken from the AI pathfinding literature. We show that in the presence of path symmetries, which are inherent to most grids but normally not road networks, TRANSIT is strongly and negatively impacted, both in terms of performance and memory requirements. We address this problem by developing a new general symmetry breaking technique which adds small random ε- values to edges in the search graph, reducing the size of the TRANSIT network by up to 4 times while preserving optimality. Using our enhancements TRANSIT achieves up to four orders of magnitude speed improvement vs. A* search and uses in many cases only a small (≤ 10MB) or modest (≤ 50MB) amount of memory. We also compare TRANSIT with CPDs, a recent and very fast database-driven pathfinding approach. We find the algorithms have complementary strengths but also identify a class of problems for which TRANSIT is up to two orders of magnitude faster than CPDs using a comparable amount of memory.

Toward that end, this article presents PROTECT, a game-theoretic system deployed by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in the Port of Boston for scheduling its patrols. USCG has termed the deployment of PROTECT in Boston a success; PROTECT is currently being tested in the Port of New York, with the potential for nationwide deployment. PROTECT is premised on an attackerdefender Stackelberg game model and offers five key innovations. First, this system is a departure from the assumption of perfect adversary rationality noted in previous work, relying instead on a quantal response (QR) model of the adversary's behavior - to the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world deployment of the QR model. Second, to improve PROTECT's efficiency, we generate a compact representation of the defender's strategy space, exploiting equivalence and dominance. Third, we show how to practically model a real maritime patrolling problem as a Stackelberg game. Fourth, our experimental results illustrate that PROTECT's QR model more robustly handles real-world uncertainties than a perfect rationality model. Finally, in evaluating PROTECT, this article for the first time provides real-world data: comparison of human-generated versus PROTECT security schedules, and results from an Adversarial Perspective Team's (human mock attackers) analysis.

However, inferring effective brain connectivity from fMRI data is a challenging task, particularly when the ultimate goal is to obtain good control-patient classification performance. Incorporating sparsity into connectivity modeling can potentially produce results that are biologically more meaningful since most biologically networks are formed by a relatively few number of connections. However, this constraint, when applied at an individual level, will degrade classification performance due to inter-subject variability. To address this problem, we consider a constrained sparse linear regression model associated with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Specifically, we introduced sparsity into brain connectivity via l1-norm penalization, and ensured consistent non-zero connections across subjects via l2-norm penalization. Our results demonstrate that the constrained sparse network gives better classification performance than the conventional correlation-based network, indicating its greater sensitivity to early stage brain pathologies.",,"algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; connectome; human; image enhancement; methodology; mild cognitive impairment; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Connectome; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Nerve Net; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity"

The rise of social networks has allowed misinformation to be easily and quickly diffused to a large community. Taking into account knowledge of its adversary's actions, the defender has to seek efficient strategies to limit the influence of the spread of misinformation by the opponent. In this paper, we address this problem as a blocking influence maximization problem using a game-theoretic approach. Two players strategically select a number of seed nodes in the social network that could initiate their own influence propagation. While the adversary attempts to maximize its negative influence, the defender tries to minimize this influence. We represent the problem as a zero-sum game and apply the Double Oracle algorithm to solve the game in combination with various heuristics for oracle phases. Our experimental results reveal that by using the game theoretic approach, we are able to significantly reduce the negative influence in comparison to when the defender does not do anything. In addition, we propose using an approximation of the payoff matrix, making the algorithms scalable to large real-world networks.

Instead, patrol units move about the transit system, inspecting the tickets of passengers, who face fines if caught fare evading. The deterrence of fare evasion depends on the unpredictability and effectiveness of the patrols. In this article, we present TRUSTS, an application for scheduling randomized patrols for fare inspection in transit systems. TRUSTS models the problem of computing patrol strategies as a leader-follower Stackelberg game where the objective is to deter fare evasion and hence maximize revenue. This problem differs from previously studied Stackelberg settings in that the leader strategies must satisfy massive temporal and spatial constraints; moreover, unlike in these counterterrorism-motivated Stackelberg applications, a large fraction of the ridership might realistically consider fare evasion, and so the number of followers is potentially huge. A third key novelty in our work is deliberate simplification of leader strategies to make patrols easier to execute. We present an efficient algorithm for computing such patrol strategies and present experimental results using real-world ridership data from the Los Angeles Metro Rail system.

Recently, a generalization has been proposed that extends possibilistic logic to a meta-epistemic logic, endowing it with the capability of reasoning about epistemic states, rather than merely constraining them. In this paper, we further develop this generalized possi-bilistic logic (GPL). We introduce an axiomatization showing that GPL is a fragment of a graded version of the modal logic KD, and we prove soundness and completeness w.r.t. a semantics in terms of possibility distributions. Next, we reveal a close link between the well-known stable model semantics for logic programming and the notion of minimally specific models in GPL. More generally, we analyze the relationship between the equilibrium logic of Pearce and GPL, showing that GPL can essentially be seen as a generalization of equilibrium logic, although its notion of minimal specificity is slightly more demanding than the notion of minimality underlying equilibrium logic.

Our approach exploits the truth-gaps inherent to propositions involving vague concepts, by allowing agents to soften directly conflicting opinions. To this end we adopt a bipolar truth-model for propositional logic characterised by lower and upper valuations on the sentences of the language. According to this model sentences may be absolutely true, absolutely false or borderline (i.e. neither absolutely true nor absolutely false). The added flexibility of a possible truth-gap between absolutely true and absolutely false allows agents with inconsistent viewpoints, in which a proposition p is absolutely true according to one view and absolutely false according to the other, to reach a compromise position in which p is borderline. Within this framework four combination operators are proposed for combining different viewpoints as represented by different valuation pairs. Intuitively, these correspond to compromise positions with different levels of semantic precision (or vagueness). Kleene belief pairs are then introduced as lower and upper measures quantifying epistemic uncertainty about the sentences of the language when valuation pairs provide the underlying truth model. The combination operators on valuation pairs are then extended to belief pairs using a general schema incorporating a probabilistic model of the interaction between agents. The properties of the four operators are then investigated within this extended framework. Copyright © 2012, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

A more modern view is to envision drivers and passengers as actively interacting with a complex automated system. Such interactive activity leads us to consider intelligent and advanced ways of interaction leading to cars that can adapt to their drivers. In this article, we focus on the adaptive cruise control (ACC) technology that allows a vehicle to automatically adjust its speed to maintain a preset distance from the vehicle in front of it based on the driver's preferences. Although individual drivers have different driving styles and preferences, current systems do not distinguish among users. We introduce a method to combine machine-learning algorithms with demographic information and expert advice into existing automated assistive systems. This method can reduce the interactions between drivers and automated systems by adjusting parameters relevant to the operation of these systems based on their specific drivers and context of drive. We also learn when users tend to engage and disengage the automated system. This method sheds light on the kinds of dynamics that users develop while interacting with automation and can teach us how to improve these systems for the benefit of their users. While generic packages such as Weka were successful in learning drivers' behavior, we found that improved learning models could be developed by adding information on drivers' demographics and a previously developed model about different driver types. We present the general methodology of our learning procedure and suggest applications of our approach to other domains as well.

Viral marketing and peacekeeping operations have both been observed to have a spreading effect. In this work, we use counterinsurgency as our illustrative domain. Defined as the effort to block the spread of support for an insurgency, such operations lack the manpower to defend the entire population and must focus on the opinions of a subset of local leaders. As past researchers of security resource allocation have done, we propose using game theory to develop such policies and model the interconnected network of leaders as a graph. Unlike this past work in security games, actions in these domains possess a probabilistic, non-local impact. To address this new class of security games, recent research has used novel heuristic oracles in a double oracle formulation to generate mixed strategies. However, these heuristic oracles were evaluated only on runtime and quality scaling with the graph size. Given the complexity of the problem, numerous other problem features and metrics must be considered to better inform practical application of such techniques. Thus, this work provides a thorough experimental analysis including variations of the contagion probability average and standard deviation. We extend the previous analysis to also examine the size of the action set constructed in the algorithms and the final mixed strategies themselves. Our results indicate that game instances featuring smaller graphs and low contagion probabilities converge slowly while games with larger graphs and medium contagion probabilities converge most quickly.

Consequently, an optimal exploitation policy may not be to pull the optimal arm repeatedly, as is the case in other variants of MAB, but rather to pull the sequence of different arms that maximises the agent's total reward within the budget. This difference from existing MABs means that new approaches to maximising the total reward are required. Given this, we develop two pulling policies, namely: (i) KUBE; and (ii) fractional KUBE. Whereas the former provides better performance up to 40% in our experimental settings, the latter is computationally less expensive. We also prove logarithmic upper bounds for the regret of both policies, and show that these bounds are asymptotically optimal (i.e. they only differ from the best possible regret by a constant factor).

Stackelberg games model the fact that a strategic attacker can surveil and exploit the defender's strategy, and randomization guards against the worst effects by making the defender less predictable. In accordance with the standard game-theoretic model of Stackelberg games, past work has typically assumed that the attacker has perfect knowledge of the defender's randomized strategy and will react correspondingly. In light of the fact that surveillance is costly, risky, and delays an attack, this assumption is clearly simplistic: attackers will usually act on partial knowledge of the defender's strategies. The attacker's imperfect estimate could present opportunities and possibly also threats to a strategic defender. In this paper, we therefore begin a systematic study of security games with limited surveillance. We propose a natural model wherein an attacker forms or updates a belief based on observed actions, and chooses an optimal response. We investigate the model both theoretically and experimentally. In particular, we give mathematical programs to compute optimal attacker and defender strategies for a fixed observation duration, and show how to use them to estimate the attacker's observation durations. Our experimental results show that the defender can achieve significant improvement in expected utility by taking the attacker's limited surveillance into account, validating the motivation of our work.

This method can save on the interactions between drivers and automated systems by adjusting parameters relevant to the operation of these systems based on their specific drivers and context of drive. We also learn when users tend to engage and disengage the automated system. This method sheds light on the kinds of dynamics that users develop while interacting with automation and can teach us how to improve these systems for the benefit of their users.

Viral marketing and peacekeeping operations have both been observed to have a spreading effect. In this work, we use counterinsurgency as our illustrative domain. Defined as the effort to block the spread of support for an insurgency, such operations lack the manpower to defend the entire population and must focus on the opinions of a subset of local leaders. As past researchers of security resource allocation have done, we propose using game theory to develop such policies and model the interconnected network of leaders as a graph. Unlike this past work in security games, actions in these domains possess a probabilistic, non-local impact. To address this new class of security games, we combine recent research in influence blocking maximization with a double oracle approach and create novel heuristic oracles to generate mixed strategies for a real-world leadership network from Afghanistan, synthetic leadership networks, and a real social network. We find that leadership networks that exhibit highly interconnected clusters can be solved equally well by our heuristic methods, but our more sophisticated heuristics outperform simpler ones in less interconnected social networks.

USCG has termed the deployment of PROTECT in Boston a success, and efforts are underway to test it in the port of New York, with the potential for nationwide deployment. PROTECT is premised on an attacker-defender Stackelberg game model and offers five key innovations. First, this system is a departure from the assumption of perfect adversary rationality noted in previous work, relying instead on a quantal response (QR) model of the adversary's behavior - to the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world deployment of the QR model. Second, to improve PROTECTS efficiency, we generate a compact representation of the defender's strategy space, exploiting equivalence and dominance. Third, we show how to practically model a real maritime patrolling problem as a Stackelberg game. Fourth, our experimental results illustrate that PROTECT's QR model more robustly handles real-world uncertainties than a perfect rationality model.

Instead, patrol units move about the transit system, inspecting the tickets of passengers, who face fines if caught fare evading. The deterrence of such fines depends on the unpredictability and effectiveness of the patrols. In this paper, we present TRUSTS, an application for scheduling randomized patrols for fare inspection in transit systems. TRUSTS models the problem of computing patrol strategies as a leader-follower Stackelberg game where the objective is to deter fare evasion and hence maximize revenue. This problem differs from previously studied Stackelberg settings in that the leader strategies must satisfy massive temporal and spatial constraints; moreover, unlike in these counterterrorism- motivated Stackelberg applications, a large fraction of the ridership might realistically consider fare evasion, and so the number of followers is potentially huge. A third key novelty in our work is deliberate simplification of leader strategies to make patrols easier to be executed. We present an efficient algorithm for computing such patrol strategies and present experimental results using real-world ridership data from the Los Angeles Metro Rail system.

A novel communication mechanism which takes into account the expected effect of communication on the other member will allow communication costs to be minimized. In extensive simulations involving more than 200 people we investigated our approach and showed that our agent achieves better coordination when involved, compared to settings in which only humans or another state-of-the-art agent are involved.

An understanding of the runtime required by algorithms that power such systems is critical to furthering the application of game theory to other real-world domains. This paper identifies the concept of the deployment-to-saturation ratio in random Stackelberg security games, and shows that problem instances for which this ratio is 0.5 are computationally harder than instances with other deployment-to-saturation ratios for a wide range of different equilibrium computation methods, including (i) previously published different MIP algorithms, and (ii) different underlying solvers and solution mechanisms. This finding has at least two important implications. First, it is important for new algorithms to be evaluated on the hardest problem instances. We show that this has often not been done in the past, and introduce a publicly available benchmark suite to facilitate such comparisons. Second, we provide evidence that this computationally hard region is also one where optimization would be of most benefit to security agencies, and thus requires significant attention from researchers in this area. Furthermore, we use the concept of phase transitions to better understand this computationally hard region. We define a decision problem related to security games, and show that the probability that this problem has a solution exhibits a phase transition as the deployment-to- saturation ratio crosses 0.5. We also demonstrate that this phase transition is invariant to changes both in the domain and the domain representation, and that the phase transition point corresponds to the computationally hardest instances.

Our results demonstrate that combining computational approaches with behavioral economics models of people in repeated interactions facilitates the design of advice provision strategies for a large class of real-world settings.

This modern electricity grid, in which both electricity and information flow in two directions between large numbers of widely distributed suppliers and generators - commonly termed the 'smart grid' - represents a radical reengineering of infrastructure which has changed little over the last hundred years. However, the autonomous behaviour expected of the smart grid, its distributed nature, and the existence of multiple stakeholders each with their own incentives and interests, challenges existing engineering approaches. In this challenge paper, we describe why we believe that artificial intelligence, and particularly, the fields of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems are essential for delivering the smart grid as it is envisioned.

With a limited budget, officials will try to distribute the patrols throughout the forest intelligently, in order to most effectively limit extraction. Prior work in forest economics has formalized this as a Stackelberg game, one very different in character from the discrete Stackelberg problem settings previously studied in the multiagent literature. Specifically, the leader wishes to minimize the distance by which a profit-maximizing extractor will trespass into the forest - or to maximize the radius of the remaining ""pristine"" forest area. The follower's cost-benefit analysis of potential trespass distances is affected by the likelihood of being caught and suffering confiscation. In this paper, we give a near-optimal patrol allocation algorithm and a 1/2-approximation algorithm, the latter of which is more efficient and yields simpler, more practical patrol allocations. Our simulations indicate that these algorithms substantially outperform existing heuristic allocations. Copyright © 2012, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

Two instances of this problem have already been solved. In the case when L is a distributive lattice with least and greatest elements 0 and 1, Goodstein proved that a function f: {0,1} n →L can be interpolated by a lattice polynomial function p: L n →L if and only if f is monotone; in this case, the interpolating polynomial p was shown to be unique.

In this case, the class of such partial functions that can be interpolated by lattice polynomial functions was completely described.

As such, integrals are operators that increase with the criteria evaluations. However, an item may be also evaluated in terms of its defects. Then the more and the greater the defects, the smaller the evaluation should be. An operator that can provide a synthesis of the defects of an item in this sense is called a desintegral. Desintegrals are maximal when no defects at all are present, while integrals are maximal when all advantages are sufficiently present. So, the greater the value of an integral, or a desintegral, the better the corresponding item since advantages are greater, or defects are smaller respectively. Desintegrals implicitly refer to a negative scale, since an order-reversing mapping of the scale used for evaluating each criterion transforms the degree to which the value is advantageous into a degree to which it is disadvantageous, and conversely. In this paper, we provide an organised description of counterparts to Sugeno integrals that synthesize positive or negative evaluations in the qualitative framework of a totally ordered residuated lattice equipped with an involutive negation.

During the radiotherapy, the prostate is radiated by high-energy x rays from different directions. In order to maximize the dose to the cancer and minimize the dose to the surrounding healthy tissues (e.g., bladder and rectum), the prostate in the new treatment image needs to be accurately localized. Therefore, the effectiveness and efficiency of external beam radiotherapy highly depend on the accurate localization of the prostate. However, due to the low contrast of the prostate with its surrounding tissues (e.g., bladder), the unpredicted prostate motion, and the large appearance variations across different treatment days, it is challenging to segment the prostate in CT images. In this paper, the authors present a novel classification based segmentation method to address these problems. Methods: To segment the prostate, the proposed method first uses sparse representation based classification (SRC) to enhance the prostate in CT images by pixel-wise classification, in order to overcome the limitation of poor contrast of the prostate images. Then, based on the classification results, previous segmented prostates of the same patient are used as patient-specific atlases to align onto the current treatment image and the majority voting strategy is finally adopted to segment the prostate. In order to address the limitations of the traditional SRC in pixel-wise classification, especially for the purpose of segmentation, the authors extend SRC from the following four aspects: (1) A discriminant subdictionary learning method is proposed to learn a discriminant and compact representation of training samples for each class so that the discriminant power of SRC can be increased and also SRC can be applied to the large-scale pixel-wise classification. (2) The L1 regularized sparse coding is replaced by the elastic net in order to obtain a smooth and clear prostate boundary in the classification result. (3) Residue-based linear regression is incorporated to improve the classification performance and to extend SRC from hard classification to soft classification. (4) Iterative SRC is proposed by using context information to iteratively refine the classification results. Results: The proposed method has been comprehensively evaluated on a dataset consisting of 330 CT images from 24 patients. The effectiveness of the extended SRC has been validated by comparing it with the traditional SRC based on the proposed four extensions. The experimental results show that our extended SRC can obtain not only more accurate classification results but also smoother and clearer prostate boundary than the traditional SRC. Besides, the comparison with other five state-of-the-art prostate segmentation methods indicates that our method can achieve better performance than other methods under comparison. Conclusions: The authors have proposed a novel prostate segmentation method based on the sparse representation based classification, which can achieve considerably accurate segmentation results in CT prostate segmentation. © 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","classification; image-guided radiation therapy; prostate CT images; segmentation; sparse representation",

Indeed, there is a wide concern to the fact that an ineffi cient water management system may become one of the major drawbacks for a human-centered sustainable development process. The assessment of reservoir water quality is constrained due to geographic considerations, the number of parameters to be considered and the huge fi nancial resources needed to get such data. Under these circumstances, the modeling of water quality in reservoirs is essential in the resolution of environmental problems and has lately been asserting itself as a relevant tool for a sustainable and harmonious progress of the populations. The analysis and development of forecast models, based on Artifi cial Intelligence-based tools and the new methodologies for problem solving, has proven to be an alternative, having in mind a pro-active behavior that may contribute decisively to diagnose, preserve, and rehabilitate the reservoirs. In particular, this work describes the training, validation and application of Artifi cial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Decision Trees (DTs) to forecast the water quality of the Odivelas reservoir, in Portugal, over a period of 10 years. The input variables of the ANN model are chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), and oxidability and total suspended solids (TSS), while for the DT the inputs are, in addition to those used by ANN, the Water Conductivity and the Temperature. The performance of the models, evaluated in terms of the coincidence matrix, created by matching the predicted and actual values, are very similar for both models; the percentage of adjustments relative to the number of presented cases is 98.8% for the training set and 97.4% for the testing one. © 2012 WIT Press.","Artifi cial Neuronal Networks; Data mining; Decision Trees; Water quality","Coincidence matrixes; Decision trees (DTs); Environmental problems; FORECAST model; Input variables; Neuronal networks; Portugal; Reservoir water quality; Total suspended solids; Training sets; Water conductivity; Water management systems; Water quality modeling; Chemical oxygen demand; Data mining; Decision trees; Forestry; Neural networks; Neurons; Reservoirs (water); Water management; Water quality; Artificial Intelligence; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Data Processing; Decision Theory; Mathematical Models; Neural Networks; Reservoirs; Water Management; Water Quality"

On the other hand, the assessment of the water quality in a reservoir is constrained due to geographic considerations, the number of parameters to be studied, and the huge fi nancial resources needed to get the necessary data. To this picture it should be added the latency times between the sampling moment and the instant that portrait the results of the laboratory analyses. However, new approaches to problem solving, namely those borrowed from the Artifi cial Intelligence arena have proven their ability and applicability in terms of simulation and modeling of the physical phenomena. Indeed, Artifi cial Neural Networks (ANNs) capture the embedded spatial and unsteady behavior in the investigated problem, using its architecture and nonlinearity nature, when compared with the other classical modeling techniques. This work describes the training, validation, and application of ANNs models for computing the oxidability and total suspended solids (TSS) levels in the Monte Novo reservoir, in Portugal, over a period of 15 years. Different network structures have been elaborated and evaluated. The performance of the ANNs models was assessed through the coeffi cient of determination (R2), mean absolute deviation, mean squared error, and bias computed from the measured and model calculated values of the dependent variables.

The ANNs selected to predict the oxidability from pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), water temperature, and volume of water stored in reservoir has a 4-11-5-1 topology, while the network selected to predict the TSS has a 5-6-5-1 topology.

This emphasis of trying to marry theory and practice at AAMAS goes all the way back to the origins of its predecessor conferences, such as the first International Conference on Autonomous Agents (Johnson 1997). However, the effort to tie research into practical applications got a significant boost with the establishment of the industry track at AAMAS, which was more recently renamed as the innovative applications track. Over the past few years, within this industry and innovative applications track at AAMAS and other related tracks at sister conferences including Innovative Applications of AI (IAAI), there have been presentations of several successful transitions of key component technologies of agents and multiagent systems. On the one hand, individual agents integrate multiple components and capabilities, for example, planning, learning, reactivity, goal orientedness, and they act autonomously while being situated in their environment - thus facilitating their application in real-world settings. On the other hand, multiagent systems and techniques focused on reasoning about multiple agents reflect the fact that there exist many autonomous agents (cooperative or self-interested) in the real world, and capturing their interaction establishes higher veracity of the model. This appropriateness of agent and multiagent systems to model complex real-world problems has led to successful transitions of practically applied technologies ranging from belief desire intention (BDI) frameworks, to game-theoretic approaches, to auction frameworks, to biologically inspired approaches. These previously successful applications have been reviewed in the literature and textbooks on multiagent systems (Wooldridge 2009, Shoham and Leyton-Brown 2008). This article focuses on the more recent efforts to marry research with practical applications that have been reported at AAMAS over the past two years. Specifically, focusing on papers from AAMAS 2010 and AAMAS 2011, we will discuss the three broad areas that have been the focus of the transition from research into practice: security, sustainability, and safety. With respect to security, research at AAMAS has emphasized the use of game-theoretic techniques to schedule limited security resources to protect targets of economic and political importance. For example, ARMOR (Pita et al. 2008; Jain et al. 2010b) schedules checkpoints and canine patrols at the Los Angeles International Airport whereas IRIS (Tsai et al. 2009; Jain et al. 2010b) schedules federal air marshals on board international flights of U.S. air carriers. More game-theoretic scheduling assistants are being designed for other security agencies as well, such as GUARDS (Pita et al. 2011) for scheduling activities conducted by the Transportation Security Administration. GUARDS is being evaluated at an undisclosed airport for potential nationwide deployment. Finally, PROTECT (An et al. 2011a) is in use for scheduling the patrols of the U.S. Coast Guard in the port of Boston and beyond. Multiagent systems have also been applied to research on the sustainable use of energy resources (Chalkiadakis et al. 2011; Kamboj, Kempton, and Decker 2011; Kok 2010). Sustainable production, delivery, and use of energy is an important challenge of today. One of the ways this can be done is by developing intelligent systems, like smart grids (Vytelingum et al. 2010b; Ramchurn et al. 2011), that can efficiently predict the use of energy and dynamically optimize its delivery. The distributed nature of the energy grid and the individual interests of users make multiagent modeling an appropriate approach for this problem. Multiagent research in this area has primarily focused on developing techniques based on game-theoretic approaches (including coalitional game theory) and auctions that help reduce the usage and wastage of energy (Vytelingum et al. 2010a; Gerding et al. 2011; Lamparter, Becher, and Fischer 2010; Vandael et al. 2011). With respect to the final area of application, safety, multiagent systems have been applied for disaster response simulations, air-traffic management, evacuation simulations, and related applications (Ramchurn et al. 2010; Dos Santos and Bazzan 2011; Schurr, Picciano, and Marecki 2010). The key advantage is the rich models of individual agents that can be brought to bear in such applications. For instance, from large-scale citywide evacuations to small-scale evacuations of buildings, emergency evacuations are unfortunately a perpetual fixture in society. While commercial evacuation simulation tools have begun to explore agent-based simulations,1 researchers at AAMAS have brought to bear richer models of agents in such simulations, allowing us to gauge the impact of different environmental, emotional, and informational conditions (Tsai et al. 2011).

An understanding of the runtime required by algorithms that power such systems is critical to furthering the application of game theory to other real-world domains. This paper identifies the concept of the deployment-to-saturation ratio in random Stackelberg security games, and shows that in a decision problem related to these games, the probability that a solution exists exhibits a phase transition as the ratio crosses 0.5. We demonstrate that this phase transition is invariant to changes both in the domain and the domain representation. Moreover, problem instances at this phase transition point are computationally harder than instances with other deployment-to-saturation ratios for a wide range of different equilibrium computation methods, including (i) previously published different MIP algorithms, and (ii) different underlying solvers and solution mechanisms. Our findings have at least two important implications. First, it is important for new algorithms to be evaluated on the hardest problem instances. We show that this has often not been done in the past, and introduce a publicly available benchmark suite to facilitate such comparisons. Second, we provide evidence that this phase transition region is also one where optimization would be of most benefit to security agencies, and thus requires significant attention from researchers in this area.

The resource allocation strategies are randomized to prevent a strategic attacker from using surveillance to learn and exploit patterns in the allocation. An important limitation of previous work on security games is that it typically assumes that attackers have perfect surveillance capabilities, and can learn the exact strategy of the defender. We introduce a new model that explicitly models the process of an attacker observing a sequence of resource allocation decisions and updating his beliefs about the defender's strategy. For this model we present computational techniques for updating the attacker's beliefs and computing optimal strategies for both the attacker and defender, given a specific number of observations. We provide multiple formulations for computing the defender's optimal strategy, including non-convex programming and a convex approximation. We also present an approximate method for computing the optimal length of time for the attacker to observe the defender's strategy before attacking. Finally, we present experimental results comparing the efficiency and runtime of our methods. Copyright © 2012, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

In Stackelberg game models of these systems the attacker knows only the probability that each target is covered by the defender, but is oblivious to the detailed timing of the coverage schedule. In many real-world situations, however, the attacker can observe the current location of the defender and can exploit this knowledge to reason about the defender's future moves. We study Stackelberg security games in which the defender sequentially moves between targets, with moves constrained by an exogenously specified graph, while the attacker can observe the defender's current location and his (stochastic) policy concerning future moves. We offer five contributions: (1) We model this adversarial patrolling game (APG) as a stochastic game with special structure and present several alternative formulations that leverage the general nonlinear programming (NLP) approach for computing equilibria in zero-sum stochastic games. We show that our formulations yield significantly better solutions than previous approaches. (2) We extend the NLP formulation for APG allow for attacks that may take multiple time steps to unfold. (3) We provide an approximate MILP formulation that uses discrete defender move probabilities. (4) We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of an NLP-based approach, and systematically study the impact of network topology on the results. (5) We extend our model to allow the defender to construct the graph constraining his moves, at some cost, and offer novel algorithms for this setting, finding that a MILP approximation is much more effective than the exact NLP in this setting.

Although the swarm algorithms have exhibited good performance across a wide range of application problems, it is difficult to analyze the convergence. In this paper, we discuss the dynamic trajectory and convergence of the swarm intelligent model, namely the particle swarm algorithm. We explore the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation using differential analysis and Laplace transform. The trajectories are parsed into first-order inertial element and second-order oscillation element. Their transfer functions are derived, and the trajectories are described in explicit time functions. The first-order inertial element is helpful to maintain the trajectory's stability and algorithm convergence, while the second-order oscillation element trends to explore some new search spaces for the better solutions. The convergence regions of the swarm system are analyzed using the spectral radius and Lyapunov second theorem on stability.","Convergence; Stability; Swarm algorithm; Swarm intelligence","Algorithm convergence; Application problems; Collective behavior; Convergence; Convergence analysis; Convergence region; Differential analysis; Dynamic trajectories; Exploration and exploitation; First-order; Global patterns; Particle swarm algorithm; Search spaces; Second orders; Spectral radii; Swarm algorithms; Swarm Intelligence; Swarm intelligent; Swarm systems; Time function; Artificial intelligence; Convergence of numerical methods; Laplace transforms; Trajectories; Algorithms"

In this paper, we formulate the scheduling problem for work-flow applications with security constraints in distributed data-intensive computing environments and present a novel security constraint model. Several meta-heuristic adaptations to the particle swarm optimization algorithm are introduced to deal with the formulation of efficient schedules. A variable neighborhood particle swarm optimization algorithm is compared with a multi-start particle swarm optimization and multi-start genetic algorithm.

The key concept involves rapid prediction of a deformation field for registration initialization, which is achieved by a statistical correlation model learned between image appearances and deformation fields. This allows us to immediately bring a template image as close as possible to a subject image that we need to register. The task of the registration algorithm is hence reduced to estimating small deformation between the subject image and the initially warped template image, i.e., the intermediate template (IT). Specifically, to obtain a good subject-specific initial deformation, support vector regression is utilized to determine the correlation between image appearances and their respective deformation fields. When registering a new subject onto the template, an initial deformation field is first predicted based on the subject's image appearance for generating an IT. With the IT, only the residual deformation needs to be estimated, presenting much less challenge to the existing registration algorithms. Our learning-based framework affords two important advantages: 1) by requiring only the estimation of the residual deformation between the IT and the subject image, the computation time can be greatly reduced; 2) by leveraging good deformation initialization, local minima giving suboptimal solution could be avoided. Our framework has been extensively evaluated using medical images from different sources, and the results indicate that, on top of accuracy improvement, significant registration speedup can be achieved, as compared with the case where no prediction of initial deformation is performed. © 2011 IEEE.","Deformation prediction; fast image registration; principal component analysis (PCA); support vector regression (SVR)","Accuracy Improvement; Computation time; Deformation field; Deformation prediction; Fast image registration; Image appearance; Local minimums; Medical images; Performance improvements; principal component analysis (PCA); Registration algorithms; Residual deformation; Statistical correlation; Subject-specific; Suboptimal solution; support vector regression (SVR); Template images; Algorithms; Forecasting; Principal component analysis; Deformation; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; image subtraction; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique"

Although laypersons commonly perceive causality as being transitive, some philosophers have questioned this assumption, and models of causality in artificial intelligence are often agnostic with respect to transitivity. We consider two formal models of causation that differ in the way they represent uncertainty. The quantitative model uses a crude probabilistic definition, arguably the common core of more sophisticated quantitative definitions; the qualitative model uses a definition based on nonmonotonic consequence relations. Different sufficient conditions for the transitivity of causation are laid bare by the two models: The Markov condition on events for the quantitative model, and a so-called saliency condition (A is perceived as a typical cause of B) for the qualitative model. We explore the formal and empirical relations between these sufficient conditions, and between the underlying definitions of perceived causation. These connections shed light on the range of applicability of each model, contrasting commonsense causal reasoning (supposedly qualitative) and scientific causation (more naturally quantitative). These speculations are supported by a series of three behavioral experiments. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Behavioral experiments; Causation; Conditional independence; Non-monotonic reasoning; Transitivity",

This study focuses on integrating multiple imaging modalities to identify individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI, often an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is difficult to diagnose due to its very mild or insignificant symptoms of cognitive impairment. Recent emergence of brain network analysis has made characterization of neurological disorders at a whole-brain connectivity level possible, thus providing new avenues for brain diseases classification. Employing multiple-kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs), we attempt to integrate information from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) for improving classification performance. Our results indicate that the multimodality classification approach yields statistically significant improvement in accuracy over using each modality independently. The classification accuracy obtained by the proposed method is 96.3%, which is an increase of at least 7.4% from the single modality-based methods and the direct data fusion method. A cross-validation estimation of the generalization performance gives an area of 0.953 under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, indicating excellent diagnostic power. The multimodality classification approach hence allows more accurate early detection of brain abnormalities with greater sensitivity. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Alzheimer's disease (AD); Brain network analysis multiple-kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs); Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); Mild cognitive impairment (MCI); Multimodality representation; Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)","adult; Alzheimer disease; article; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diffusion tensor imaging; disease classification; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; image analysis; image processing; male; mild cognitive impairment; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; support vector machine; symptom; validation process; Aged; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Cluster Analysis; Cohort Studies; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Nerve Net; Neural Pathways; Neuropsychological Tests; Nonlinear Dynamics; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Support Vector Machines"

Recently, rather than predicting categorical variables as in classification, several pattern regression methods have also been used to estimate continuous clinical variables from brain images. However, most existing regression methods focus on estimating multiple clinical variables separately and thus cannot utilize the intrinsic useful correlation information among different clinical variables. On the other hand, in those regression methods, only a single modality of data (usually only the structural MRI) is often used, without considering the complementary information that can be provided by different modalities. In this paper, we propose a general methodology, namely multi-modal multi-task (M3T) learning, to jointly predict multiple variables from multi-modal data. Here, the variables include not only the clinical variables used for regression but also the categorical variable used for classification, with different tasks corresponding to prediction of different variables. Specifically, our method contains two key components, i.e., (1) a multi-task feature selection which selects the common subset of relevant features for multiple variables from each modality, and (2) a multi-modal support vector machine which fuses the above-selected features from all modalities to predict multiple (regression and classification) variables. To validate our method, we perform two sets of experiments on ADNI baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data from 45 AD patients, 91 MCI patients, and 50 healthy controls (HC). In the first set of experiments, we estimate two clinical variables such as Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), as well as one categorical variable (with value of 'AD', 'MCI' or 'HC'), from the baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data.

The existing theoretical research on PSO focuses on the issues like stability, convergence, and explosion of the swarm. However, all of them are based on the gbest (global best) communication topology, which usually is susceptible to false or premature convergence over multi-modal fitness landscapes. The present standard PSO (SPSO 2007) uses an lbest (local best) topology, where a particle is stochastically attracted not towards the best position found in the entire swarm, but towards the best position found by any particle in its topological neighborhood. This article presents a first step towards a probabilistic analysis of the particle interaction and information exchange in an lbest PSO with variable random neighborhood topology (as found in SPSO 2007). It addresses issues like the distribution of particles over neighborhoods, the probability distributions of the social and cognitive terms in lbest model, and the explorative power of the lbest PSO. It also presents a state-space model of the lbest PSO and draws important conclusions regarding the stability and convergence of the particle dynamics in the light of control theory. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Most existing studies focus on cross-sectional analysis, i.e., learning a sparse model based on single time-point of data. However, in some brain imaging applications, multiple time-points of data are often available, thus longitudinal analysis can be performed to better uncover the underlying disease progression patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method aiming for longitudinal analysis with multiple time-points of data. Specifically, for each time-point, we train a sparse linear regression model by using the imaging data and the corresponding responses, and further use the group regularization to group the weights corresponding to the same brain region across different time-points together. Moreover, to reflect the smooth changes between adjacent time-points of data, we also include two smoothness regularization terms into the objective function, i.e., one fused smoothness term which requires the differences between two successive weight vectors from adjacent time-points should be small, and another output smoothness term which requires the differences between outputs of two successive models from adjacent time-points should also be small. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve the new objective function with both group-sparsity and smoothness regularizations.

Note that MCI is a prodromal stage of AD, with possibility to convert to AD. Most traditional methods for MCI conversion prediction learn information only from MCI subjects (including MCI-C and MCI-NC), not from other related subjects, e.g., AD and normal controls (NC), which can actually aid the classification between MCI-C and MCI-NC. In this paper, we propose a novel domain-transfer learning method for MCI conversion prediction. Different from most existing methods, we classify MCI-C and MCI-NC with aid from the domain knowledge learned with AD and NC subjects as auxiliary domain to further improve the classification performance.

However, many of the standard assumptions fail to address human adversaries who security forces will likely face. To address this challenge, previous research has attempted to integrate models of human decision-making into the game-theoretic algorithms for security settings. The current leading approach, based on experimental evaluation, is derived from a well-founded solution concept known as quantal response and is known as BRQR. One critical difficulty with opponent modeling in general is that, in security domains, information about potential adversaries is often sparse or noisy and furthermore, the games themselves are highly complex and large in scale. Thus, we chose to examine a completely new approach to addressing human adversaries that avoids the complex task of modeling human decision-making. We leverage and modify robust optimization techniques to create a new type of optimization where the defender's loss for a potential deviation by the attacker is bounded by the distance of that deviation from the expected-value-maximizing strategy. To demonstrate the advantages of our approach, we introduce a systematic way to generate meaningful reward structures and compare our approach with BRQR in the most comprehensive investigation to date involving 104 security settings where previous work has tested only up to 10 security settings. Our experimental analysis reveals our approach performing as well as or outperforming BRQR in over 90% of the security settings tested and we demonstrate significant runtime benefits. These results are in favor of utilizing an approach based on robust optimization in these complex domains to avoid the difficulties of opponent modeling. © 2012 The Author(s).",,"Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Optimization; Experimental analysis; Experimental evaluation; Human decision making; Robust approaches; Robust optimization; Security settings; Solution concepts; Standard assumptions; Game theory"

While their mathematical formulations are very similar, the underlying assumptions differ and the latter problem turns out to be a special case of the former. Sugeno integrals are very general aggregation operations that can represent preference relations between uncertain acts or between multifactorial alternatives where attributes share the same totally ordered domain. This paper proposes a generalized form of the Sugeno integral that can cope with attributes which have distinct domains via the use of qualitative utility functions. In the case of decision under uncertainty, this model corresponds to state-dependent preferences on act consequences. Axiomatizations of the corresponding preference function-als are proposed in the cases where uncertainty is represented by possibility measures, by necessity measures, and by general monotonic set-functions, respectively. This is achieved by weakening previously proposed axiom systems for Sugeno integrals. © 2012 The Author(s).",,"Artificial intelligence; Decision theory; Aggregation operation; Decision under uncertainty; Mathematical formulation; Multiple criteria decision making; Necessity measures; Possibility measure; Preference functions; Preference relation; Decision making"

This is unrealistic in many real-world applications, where highly heterogeneous bidders with different risk attitudes and widely varying valuation distributions commonly compete with each other. Using computational service auctions that are emerging in cloud and grid settings as a motivating example, we examine how an intelligent agent should bid in such multi-unit auctions with asymmetric bidders. Specifically, we describe the equilibrium bidding strategies in three different settings that are distinguished by the levels of uncertainty about the types of other agents. First, we consider a setting with full knowledge about all agents' types, then we consider the case where the types are uncertain, but the number of bidders is known. Finally, we consider the case where both the number of bidders and their types are uncertain. Our experiments show that using the equilibrium strategies derived from our full analysis leads to increased utility (typically 20 - 25%) for the participants compared to previous state-of-the-art strategies. © 2012 The Author(s).",,"Artificial intelligence; Stochastic systems; Asymmetric bidders; Equilibrium bidding strategies; Equilibrium strategy; Multi-unit auction; Real-world; Risk attitude; State of the art; Stochastic numbers; Commerce"

Critically, as workers produce results of varying quality, the utility of each assigned task is unknown and can vary both between workers and individual tasks. Furthermore, in realistic settings, workers are likely to have limits on the number of tasks they can perform and the employer will have a fixed budget to spend on hiring workers. Given these constraints, the objective of the employer is to assign tasks to workers in order to maximise the overall utility achieved. To achieve this, we introduce a novel multi-armed bandit (MAB) model, the bounded MAB, that naturally captures the problem of expert crowdsourcing. We also propose an algorithm to solve it efficiently, called bounded ε-first, which uses the first sB of its total budget B to derive estimates of the workers' quality characteristics (exploration), while the remaining (1 - ε) B is used to maximise the total utility based on those estimates (exploitation). We show that using this technique allows us to derive an OB2/3) upper bound on our algorithm's performance regret (i.e. the expected difference in utility between the optimal and our algorithm). In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing crowdsourcing methods by up to 155% in experiments based on real-world data from a prominent crowdsourcing site, while achieving up to 75% of a hypothetical optimal with full information. © 2012 The Author(s).",,"Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Algorithm's performance; Crowdsourcing; Fixed budget; Full informations; Multi armed bandit; Quality characteristic; Total budget; Working costs; Budget control"

However, it is difficult to localize the prostate in CT images due to low image contrast, unpredicted motion and large appearance variations across different treatment days. To address these issues, we propose a sparse representation based classification method to accurately segment the prostate. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) A discriminant dictionary learning technique is proposed to overcome the limitation of the traditional Sparse Representation based Classifier (SRC). (2) Context features are incorporated into SRC to refine the prostate boundary in an iterative scheme. (3) A residue-based linear regression model is trained to increase the classification performance of SRC and extend it from hard classification to soft classification. To segment the prostate, the new treatment image is first rigidly aligned to the planning image space based on the pelvic bones. Then two sets of location-adaptive SRCs along two coordinate directions are applied on the aligned treatment image to produce a probability map, based on which all previously segmented images of the same patient are rigidly aligned onto the new treatment image and majority voting strategy is further adopted to finally segment the prostate in the new treatment image.

In the proposed approach, the agent attempts to convince a person by providing examples for the person to emulate or by providing justifications for the person to internalize and build or change her preferences accordingly. The agent can take into account examples and justifications provided by the person. In a series of experiments where the task was selecting a location for a school, a computer agent interacted with subjects using a textual chat-type interface, with different agent designs being used in different experiments. The results show that the example-providing agent outperformed the justification providing agent and both, surprisingly, outperformed an agent which presented the subject with both examples and justifications. In addition, it was demonstrated that in some cases the best strategy for the agent is to keep silent. © 2012 The Author(s).",,"Agent design; Computer agents; Artificial intelligence"

In doing so, we develop the first principled approach that enables the coordination of multiple, concurrent negotiation threads for practical negotiation settings. Furthermore, we validate our strategy using the agents and domains developed for the International Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC), and we benchmark our strategy against the state-of-the-art.

If the virtual bees are unable to locate a good food source even after a particular number of cycles then they are forced towards another food source with the help of a small perturbation. The corresponding algorithm is named as C-ABC, where C stands for Cauchy distribution which helps the bees in getting away from food sources which are not so good.

Complex systems are usually built with redundancy allowing them to withstand the failure of a small number of components. In this paper, we assume that we know the structure of the system, and, as a result, for each possible set of failed components, we can tell whether this set will lead to a system failure. For each component A, we know the probability P(A) of its failure with some uncertainty: e.g., we know the lower and upper bounds and for this probability. Usually, it is assumed that failures of different components are independent events. Our objective is to use all this information to estimate the probability of failure of the entire the complex system.

Similar security applications (e.g., ARMOR and IRIS) have focused on one-off tailored applications and one security activity (e.g. checkpoints) per application, GUARDS on the other hand faces three new key issues: (i) reasoning about hundreds of heterogeneous security activities; (ii) reasoning over diverse potential threats; (iii) developing a system designed for hundreds of end-users.

This provides a lattice of arguments where the reliability of sources can be taken into account. Instead of providing a unique fusion result, the method yields a structured view of partial results labelled by subsets of sources and allows us to argue about the most appropriate evaluation.

In the specific setting we consider (a variation of Boolean games), we assume there is some set of environment variables, the value of which is not directly accessible to players; each player has their own beliefs about these variables, and makes decisions about what actions to perform based on these beliefs. The communication we consider takes the form of (truthful) announcements about the value of some environment variables; the effect of an announcement about some variable is to modify the beliefs of the players who hear the announcement so that they accurately reflect the value of the announced variables. By choosing announcements appropriately, it is possible to perturb the game away from certain rational outcomes and towards others. We specifically focus on the issue of stabilisation: making announcements that transform a game from having no stable states to one that has stable configurations.",,"Boolean games; Stable Configuration; Stable state; Artificial intelligence; Communication"

In this context, while it is desirable to generate a coalition structure that maximizes the sum of the values of the coalitions, the space of possible solutions is often too large to allow exhaustive search. Thus, a fundamental open question in this area is the following: Can we search through only a subset of coalition structures, and be guaranteed to find a solution that is within a desirable bound β from optimum? If so, what is the minimum such subset? To date, the above question has only been partially answered by Sandholm et al. in their seminal work on anytime coalition structure generation [Sandholm et al., 1999].

Complex systems are usually built with redundancy allowing them to withstand the failure of a small number of components. In this paper, we assume that we know the structure of the system, and, as a result, for each possible set of failed components, we can tell whether this set will lead to a system failure. In some cases, for each component A, we know the probability P(A) of its failure; in other cases, however, we only know the lower and upper bounds P(A) and P̄(A) for this probability. Sometimes, we only have expert estimates for these probabilities, estimates that can be described as fuzzy numbers. Usually, it is assumed that failures of different components are independent events, but sometimes, we know that they are dependent - in which case we usually do not have any specific information about their correlation. Our objective is to use all this information to estimate the probability of failure of the entire the complex system.

The way in which we influence preferences is by overlaying games with taxation schemes. In a Boolean game, each player has unique control of a set of Boolean variables, and the choices available to the player correspond to the possible assignments that may be made to these variables. Each player also has a goal, represented by a Boolean formula, that they desire to see satisfied. Whether or not a player's goal is satisfied will depend both on their own choices and on the choices of others, which gives Boolean games their strategic character. We extend this basic framework by introducing an external principal who is able to levy a taxation scheme on the game, which imposes a cost on every possible action that a player can choose. By designing a taxation scheme appropriately, it is possible to perturb the preferences of the players, so that they are incentivised to choose some equilibrium that would not otherwise be chosen. After motivating and formally presenting our model, we explore some issues surrounding it, including the complexity of finding a taxation scheme that implements some socially desirable outcome, and then discuss desirable properties of taxation schemes.",,"Boolean formulae; Boolean games; Boolean variables; Incentive engineering; Artificial intelligence; Taxation; Boolean algebra"

In a very generic way, knowledge can be defined as information (which can be expressed in the form of propositions) from the environment. What is knowledge representation? Again, in simple words, can be defined as symbols used to represent the propositions. What is knowledge representation and reasoning? One way to define it is as the manipulation of symbols encoding propositions to produce representations of new propositions. The question of representing knowledge is a key issue in artificial intelligence: how can human knowledge of all kinds be represented by a computer language, and in such a way that computers can use this knowledge for purposes of reasoning? Modern computer applications have led to generalized use of knowledge representations in various contexts, including information search, simulation, web semantic ontology description. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.",,

This paper provides four key contributions in this context. First, it identifies a fundamentally problematic aspect of current algorithms for security games. It shows that there are many situations where these algorithms face multiple equilibria, and they arbitrarily select one that may hand the defender a significant disadvantage, particularly if the attacker deviates from its equilibrium strategies due to unknown constraints. Second, for important subclasses of security games, it identifies situations where we will face such multiple equilibria. Third, to address these problematic situations, it presents two equilibrium refinement algorithms that can optimize the defender's utility if the attacker deviates from equilibrium strategies. Finally, it experimentally illustrates that the refinement approach achieved significant robustness in consideration of attackers' deviation due to unknown constraints.

We show that these rules have a number of desirable computational properties. In particular, with unweighted votes, it is NP-hard to manipulate either rule with one manipulator, whilst with weighted votes, it is NP-hard to manipulate either rule with a small number of candidates and a coalition of manipulators. As only a couple of other voting rules are known to be NP-hard to manipulate with a single manipulator, Nanson's and Baldwin's rules appear to be particularly resistant to manipulation from a theoretical perspective. We also propose a number of approximation methods for manipulating these two rules. Experiments demonstrate that both rules are often difficult to manipulate in practice. These results suggest that elimination style voting rules deserve further study. Copyright © 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

However, in many real-world applications, there are inherent constraints on feasible coalitions: for instance, certain agents may be prohibited from being in the same coalition, or the coalition structure may be required to consist of coalitions of the same size. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of constrained coalition formation (CCF). We propose a general framework for this problem, and identify an important class of CCF settings, where the constraints specify which groups of agents should/should not work together. We describe a procedure that transforms such constraints into a structured input that allows coalition formation algorithms to identify, without any redundant computations, all the feasible coalitions. We then use this procedure to develop an algorithm for generating an optimal (welfare-maximizing) constrained coalition structure, and show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by several orders of magnitude.

Some of these settings include security domains, where people can be characterized as uncooperative, hostile, manipulative, and tending to take advantage of the situation for their own needs. This makes it challenging to design proficient agents to interact with people in such environments. Evaluating the success of the agents automatically before evaluating them with people or deploying them could alleviate this challenge and result in better designed agents. In this paper we show how Peer Designed Agents (PDAs) - computer agents developed by human subjects - can be used as a method for evaluating autonomous agents in security domains. Such evaluation can reduce the effort and costs involved in evaluating autonomous agents interacting with people to validate their efficacy. Our experiments included more than 70 human subjects and 40 PDAs developed by students. The study provides empirical support that PDAs can be used to compare the proficiency of autonomous agents when matched with people in security domains.

Such partial information is described by an information set, which is the set of profiles of the non-manipulators that are indistinguishable to the manipulator. Given such an information set, a dominating manipulation is a non-truthful vote that the manipulator can cast which makes the winner at least as preferable (and sometimes more preferable) as the winner when the manipulator votes truthfully. When the manipulator has full information, computing whether or not there exists a dominating manipulation is in P for many common voting rules (by known results). We show that when the manipulator has no information, there is no dominating manipulation for many common voting rules. When the manipulator's information is represented by partial orders and only a small portion of the preferences are unknown, computing a dominating manipulation is NP-hard for many common voting rules. Our results thus throw light on whether we can prevent strategic behavior by limiting information about the votes of other voters.

However, this is a weak representation that neglects potentially useful information about a set such as its cardinality. For set variables, the length-lex (LL) representation successfully provides information about the length (cardinality) and position in the lexicographic ordering. For multiset variables, where elements can be repeated, we consider richer representations that take into account additional information. We study eight different representations in which we maintain bounds according to one of the eight different orderings: length-(co)lex (LL/LC), variety-(co)lex (VL/VC), length-variety-(co)lex (LVL/LVC), and variety-length-(co)lex (VLL/VLC) orderings. These representations integrate together information about the cardinality, variety (number of distinct elements in the multiset), and position in some total ordering. Theoretical and empirical comparisons of expressiveness and compactness of the eight representations suggest that length-variety-(co) lex (LVL/LVC) and variety-length-(co)lex (VLL/VLC) usually give tighter bounds after constraint propagation. We implement the eight representations and evaluate them against the subset bounds representation with cardinality and variety reasoning. Results demonstrate that they offer significantly better pruning and runtime. Copyright © 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

The motivation behind such agent's behavior resides in the utility function that the agent's designer wants to maximize and which may be different from the user's utility function. Specifically, in the strategic settings studied, the agent provides correct yet partial information about a state of the world that is unknown to the user but relevant to his decision. Persuasion games were designed to study interactions between automated players where one player sends state information to the other to persuade it to behave in a certain way. We show that this game theory based model is not sufficient to model human-agent interactions, since people tend to deviate from the rational choice. We use machine learning to model such deviation in people from this game theory based model. The agent generates a probabilistic description of the world state that maximizes its benefit and presents it to the users. The proposed model was evaluated in an extensive empirical study involving road selection tasks that differ in length, costs and congestion. Results showed that people's behavior indeed deviated significantly from the behavior predicted by the game theory based model. Moreover, the agent developed in our model performed better than an agent that followed the behavior dictated by the game-theoretical models.

This paper presents an agent that clusters people into one of several types, based on how their path selection behavior adheres to the paths preferred by the agent and are not necessarily preferred by the people. It predicts the likelihood that people deviate from these suggested paths and uses a decision theoretic approach to suggest modified paths to people that will maximize the agent's expected benefit.

One critical assumption of traditional Stackelberg models is that all players are perfectly rational and that the followers perfectly observe the leader's strategy. However, in real-world security settings, security agencies must deal with human adversaries who may not always follow the utility maximizing rational strategy. Accounting for these likely deviations is important since they may adversely affect the leader's (security agency's) utility. In fact, a number of behavioral game-theoretic models have begun to emerge for these domains. Two such models in particular are COBRA (Combined Observability and Bounded Rationality Assumption) and BRQR (Best Response to Quantal Response), which have both been shown to outperform game-theoretic optimal models against human adversaries within a security setting based on Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Under perfect observation conditions, BRQR has been shown to be the leading contender for addressing human adversaries. In this work we explore these models under limited observation conditions. Due to human anchoring biases, BRQR's performance may suffer under limited observation conditions. An anchoring bias is when, given no information about the occurrence of a discrete set of events, humans will tend to assign an equal weight to the occurrence of each event (a uniform distribution). This study makes three main contributions: (i) we incorporate an anchoring bias into BRQR to improve performance under limited observation; (ii) we explore finding appropriate parameter settings for BRQR under limited observation; (iii) we compare BRQR's performance versus COBRA under limited observation conditions.

Specifically, we prove that noise in observations prevents standard fictitious play from converging to Nash equilibrium in potential games, which also makes fictitious play impractical for solving Dec-POMDPs. To combat this, we derive filtered fictitious play, and provide conditions under which it converges to a Nash equilibrium in potential games with noisy observations. We then use filtered fictitious play to construct a solver for Dec-POMDPs, and demonstrate our new algorithm's performance in a box pushing problem.

Given a set of longitudinal images of different subjects, the task is how to construct the unbias longitudinal atlas sequence reflecting the anatomical changes over time. In this paper, a novel longitudinal atlas construction framework is proposed. The main contributions of the proposed method lie in the following aspects: (1) Subject-specific longitudinal information is captured by establishing a robust growth model for each subject. (2) The trajectory constraints are enforced for both subject image sequences and the atlas sequence, and only one transformation is needed for each subject to map its image sequence to the atlas sequence while preserving the temporal correspondence. (3) The longitudinal atlases are estimated by groupwise registration and kernel regression, thus no explicit template is used and the atlases are constructed without introducing bias due to the selection of the explicit template. (4) The proposed method is general, where the number of longitudinal images of each subject and the time points at which the images are taken can be different. The proposed method is evaluated on a longitudinal database and compared with a state-of-the-art longitudinal atlas construction method. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves more consistent spatial-temporal correspondence as well as higher registration accuracy than the compared method.",,"algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; histology; human; image enhancement; image subtraction; longitudinal study; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique"

However, service execution times are often highly uncertain and service providers may have incentives to lie strategically about this uncertainty to win more customers. In this paper, we argue that techniques from the field of artificial intelligence are instrumental to addressing these challenges. To this end, we first propose a new decision-theoretic algorithm that allows a single service consumer agent to procure services for a computational task with a strict deadline. Crucially, this algorithm uses redundancy in a principled manner to mitigate uncertain execution times and maximise the consumer's expected utility. We present both an optimal variant that uses a novel branch-and-bound formulation, and a fast heuristic that achieves near-optimal performance. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our algorithms outperform approaches that do not employ redundancy by up to 130% in some settings. Next, as the algorithms require private information about the providers' capabilities, we show how techniques from mechanism design can be used to incentivise truthfulness. As no existing work in this area deals with uncertain execution times and redundant invocations, we extend the state of the art by proposing a number of payment schemes for these settings. In a detailed analysis, we prove that our mechanisms fulfil a range of desirable economic properties, including incentive compatibility, and we discuss suboptimal variants that scale to realistic settings with hundreds of providers. We show experimentally that our mechanisms extract a high surplus and that even our suboptimal variants typically achieve a high efficiency (95% or more in a wide range of settings). © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Algorithms for computing the defender's optimal strategy are used in deployed decision-support tools in use by the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), the Federal Air Marshals Service, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Those algorithms take into account various resource usage constraints defined by human users. However, those constraints may lead to poor (even infeasible) solutions due to users' insufficient information and bounded rationality.

In the field of artificial intelligence, revision strategies have been extensively studied in the context of logic-based formalisms and probability kinematics. However, so far there is not much literature on this topic in evidence theory. In contrast, combination rules proposed so far in the theory of evidence, especially Dempster rule, are symmetric. They rely on a basic assumption, that is, pieces of evidence being combined are considered to be on a par, i.e. play the same role. When one source of evidence is less reliable than another, it is possible to discount it and then a symmetric combination operation is still used. In the case of revision, the idea is to let prior knowledge of an agent be altered by some input information. The change problem is thus intrinsically asymmetric. Assuming the input information is reliable, it should be retained whilst the prior information should be changed minimally to that effect. To deal with this issue, this paper defines the notion of revision for the theory of evidence in such a way as to bring together probabilistic and logical views. Several revision rules previously proposed are reviewed and we advocate one of them as better corresponding to the idea of revision. It is extended to cope with inconsistency between prior and input information. It reduces to Dempster rule of combination, just like revision in the sense of Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson (AGM) reduces to expansion, when the input is strongly consistent with the prior belief function. Properties of this revision rule are also investigated and it is shown to generalize Jeffrey's rule of updating, Dempster rule of conditioning and a form of AGM revision. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.","belief revision; Dempster conditioning; probability; Theory of evidence","Belief function; Belief revision; Combination operation; Combination rules; Dempster; Dempster rule; Dempster rule of combination; Evidence theories; Prior information; Prior knowledge; Probability kinematics; Theory of evidence; Artificial intelligence; Gallium; Uncertainty analysis; Probabilistic logics"

Such a problem has a wide variety of practical applications, ranging from matching resident doctors to hospitals, to matching students to schools or more generally to any two-sided market. In the classical stable marriage problem, both men and women express a strict preference order over the members of the other sex, in a qualitative way. Here we consider stable marriage problems with weighted preferences: each man (resp., woman) provides a score for each woman (resp., man). Such problems are more expressive than the classical stable marriage problems. Moreover, in some real-life situations it is more natural to express scores (to model, for example, profits or costs) rather than a qualitative preference ordering. In this context, we define new notions of stability and optimality, and we provide algorithms to find marriages which are stable and/or optimal according to these notions. While expressivity greatly increases by adopting weighted preferences, we show that in most cases the desired solutions can be found by adapting existing algorithms for the classical stable marriage problem.","Stable marriages; Weighted preferences","Classical stable marriages; Matching problems; Optimality; Preference order; Stable marriage problem; Stable marriages; Two-sided markets; Weighted preferences; Algorithms; Profitability; Artificial intelligence"

There is a growing need for new methods that can efficiently and objectively extract the useful information from fMRI data and translate it into intelligible knowledge.

In this paper, we investigate a multi-swarm approach to the problem of neighbor selection (NS) in P2P networks. Particle swarm share some common characteristics with P2P in the dynamic socially environment. Each particle encodes the upper half of the peer-connection matrix through the undirected graph, which reduces the search space dimension. The portion of the adjustment to the velocity influenced by the individual's cognition, the group cognition from multi-swarms, and the social cognition from the whole swarm, makes an important influence on the particles' ergodic and synergetic performance. We also attempt to theoretically prove that the multi-swarm optimization algorithm converges with a probability of 1 towards the global optima. The performance of our approach is evaluated and compared with other two different algorithms. The results indicate that it usually required shorter time to obtain better results than the other considered methods, specially for large scale problems. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Genetic algorithm; Neighbor selection; P2P swarming networks; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm intelligence; Undirected graph","Connection matrices; Ergodics; Globaloptimum; Large-scale problem; Multi-swarms; Neighbor selection; P2P network; P2P swarming networks; Particle swarm; Peer to peer; Peer-to-peer overlay networks; Search efficiency; Search space dimension; Social cognition; Swarm intelligence; Undirected graph; Artificial intelligence; Cellular automata; Distributed computer systems; Genetic algorithms; Overlay networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Peer to peer networks"

In this paper we focus on developing conflict resolution models that are able to classify the disputant parties according to their personal conflict style. Moreover, we present a dynamic conflict resolution model that is able to use that information to adapt strategies in real time according to significant changes in the context of interaction.

We compared the predictive capabilities of traditional learning methods with those where we added key elements of AAT and other optimal and bounded rationality models.

Algorithms for similar security-related scheduling problems have been proposed in recent literature, but security scheduling in networked domains when targets have varying importance remains an open problem at large. In this paper, we cast the network security problem as an attacker- defender zero-sum game. The strategy spaces for both players are exponentially large, so this requires the development of novel, scalable techniques. We first show that existing algorithms for approximate solutions can be arbitrarily bad in general settings. We present Rugged (Randomization in Urban Graphs by Generating strategies for Enemy and Defender), the first scalable optimal solution technique for such network security games. Our technique is based on a double oracle approach and thus does not require the enumeration of the entire strategy space for either of the players. It scales up to realistic problem sizes, as is shown by our evaluation of maps of southern Mumbai obtained from GIS data.

A player's strategy set is the set of all possible valuations that may be made to its variables. A player's goal formula may contain variables controlled by other agents, and in this case, it must reason strategically about how best to assign values to its variables. In the present paper, we consider the possibility of overlaying Boolean games with taxation schemes. A taxation scheme imposes a cost on every possible assignment an agent can make. By designing a taxation scheme appropriately, it is possible to perturb the preferences of the agents within a society, so that agents are rationally incentivised to choose some socially desirable equilibrium that would not otherwise be chosen, or incentivised to rule out some socially undesirable equilibria. After formally presenting the model, we explore some issues surrounding it (e.g., the complexity of finding a taxation scheme that implements some socially desirable outcome), and then discuss possible desirable properties of taxation schemes.

B-MOMS extends the max-sum message-passing algorithm for decentralised coordination to compute bounded approximate solutions to multi-objective decentralised constraint optimisation problems (MO-DCOPs). Specifically, we prove the optimality of B-MOMS in acyclic constraint graphs, and derive problem dependent bounds on its approximation ratio when these graphs contain cycles. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate its performance on a multi-objective extension of the canonical graph colouring problem. In so doing, we demonstrate that, for the settings we consider, the approximation ratio never exceeds 2, and is typically less than 1.5 for less-constrained graphs. Moreover, the runtime required by B-MOMS on the problem instances we considered never exceeds 30 minutes, even for maximally constrained graphs with 100 agents. Thus, B-MOMS brings the problem of multi-objective optimisation well within the boundaries of the limited capabilities of embedded agents.

To date, the consensus problem has been typically solved with decentralized algorithms based on graph Laplacians. However, the convergence of these algorithms is often too slow for many important multiagent applications, and thus they are increasingly being combined with acceleration methods. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art acceleration techniques require parameters that can be optimally selected only if complete information about the network topology is available, which is rarely the case in practice. We address this limitation by deriving two novel acceleration methods that can deliver good performance even if little information about the network is available. The first is based on the Chebyshev semi-iterative method and maximizes the worst-case convergence speed given that only rough bounds on the extremal eigenvalues of the network matrix are available. It can be applied to systems where agents use unreliable communication links, and its computational complexity is similar to those of simple Laplacian-based methods. This algorithm requires synchronization among agents, so we also propose an asynchronous version that approximates the output of the synchronous algorithm. Mathematical analysis and numerical simulations show that the convergence speed of the proposed acceleration methods decrease gracefully in scenarios where the sole use of Laplacian-based methods is known to be impractical.

Therefore, C-optimality allows us to explore the space of criteria (beyond size and distance) looking for those that lead to better solution qualities. We benefit from this larger space of criteria to propose a new criterion, the so- called size-bounded-distance criterion, which outperforms k- And t-optimality.

We consider coordination problems that can be framed as Distributed Constraint Optimisation Problems, and as such, are suitable to be deployed on large scale multi-agent systems such as sensor networks or multiple unmanned aerial vehicles. Specifically, we focus on techniques that exploit structural independence among agents' actions to provide optimal solutions to the coordination problem, and, in particular, we use the Generalized Distributive Law (GDL) algorithm. In this settings, we propose a novel resource aware heuristic to build junction trees and to schedule GDL computations across the agents. Our goal is to minimise the total running time of the coordination process, rather than the theoretical complexity of the computation, by explicitly considering the computation and communication capabilities of agents. We evaluate our proposed approach against DPOP, RDPI and a centralized solver on a number of benchmark coordination problems, and show that our approach is able to provide optimal solutions for DCOPs faster than previous approaches. Specifically, in the settings considered, when resources are scarce our approach is up to three times faster than DPOP (which proved to be the best among the competitors in our settings).

The variety of different auction rules, restrictions in supply or demand, and the agents' combinatorial preferences for sets of goods, mean that realistic scenarios are very complex. Using game theory, we design trading strategies for participating in a single auction or group of similar auctions. A number of concerns need to be considered in order to account for all the relevant features of real-world auctions; these include: budget constraints, uncertainty in the value of the desired goods, the auction reserve prices, the bidders' attitudes towards risk, purchasing multiple units, competition and spitefulness between bidders, the existence of multiple sources for each good. To design a realistic agent, it is necessary to analyze the multi-unit auctions in which a combination of these issues are present together and we have made significant progress towards this goal.

Thus there is an urgent need to find alternatives to litigation for resolving conflicts. Methods of Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) need to be considered to resolve such disputes. Having agents understanding what the dispute is about, managing all interaction between the parties and even formulating proposed solutions is an important innovation. Hence it is of the utmost relevance that the agents may be able to recognise and evaluate the facts, the position of the parties and understand all the relevant data. In many circumstances, risk management and avoidance will be a crucial point to be considered. In this sense we analyze the usefulness of a parallel concept to BATNA - Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement, that of a WATNA - Worst Alternative to Negotiated Agreement, allowing the software agents to consider the space between BATNA and WATNA as a useful element to be taken into account when making or accepting a proposal. These software agents embodied with intelligent techniques are integrated in an architecture designed to provide support to the ODR in a system we have developed for the resolution of labour disputes - UMCourt.

When a source of evidence is less reliable than another, it is possible to discount it and then a symmetric combination operation is still used. In the case of revision, the idea is to let prior knowledge of an agent be altered by some input information. The change problem is thus intrinsically asymmetric. Assuming the input information is reliable, it should be retained whilst the prior information should be changed minimally to that effect. Although belief revision is already an important subfield of artificial intelligence, so far, it has been little addressed in evidence theory. In this paper, we define the notion of revision for the theory of evidence and propose several different revision rules, called the inner and outer revisions, and a modified adaptive outer revision, which better corresponds to the idea of revision.

In contrast, this work sets aside these fundamental premises and focuses instead on heterogeneous autonomous interactions between two or more agents. Specifically, we introduce a new and concise representation for repeated adversarial (constant-sum) games that highlight the necessary features that enable an automated planing agent to reason about how to score above the game's Nash equilibrium, when facing heterogeneous adversaries. To this end, we present TeamUP, a model-based RL algorithm designed for learning and planning such an abstraction. In essence, it is somewhat similar to R-max with a cleverly engineered reward shaping that treats exploration as an adversarial optimization problem. In practice, it attempts to find an ally with which to tacitly collude (in more than two-player games) and then collaborates on a joint plan of actions that can consistently score a high utility in adversarial repeated games. We use the inaugural Lemonade Stand Game Tournament1 to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and find that TeamUP is the best performing agent, demoting the Tournament's actual winning strategy into second place. In our experimental analysis, we show hat our strategy successfully and consistently builds collaborations with many different heterogeneous (and sometimes very sophisticated) adversaries.",,"Automated planning; Concise representations; Experimental analysis; Nash Equilibrium; Optimization problems; Repeated games; Self-play; Two-player games; Winning strategy; Artificial intelligence; Autonomous agents; Beverages; Game theory"

In this paper, we study the computational complexity of finding the next solution in some common preference-based representation formalisms. We show that this problem is hard in general CSPs, but it can be easy in tree-shaped CSPs and tree-shaped fuzzy CSPs. However, it is difficult in weighted CSPs, even if we restrict the shape of the constraint graph. We also consider CP-nets, showing that the problem is easy in acyclic CP-nets, as well as in constrained acyclic CP-nets where the (soft) constraints are tree-shaped and topologically compatible with the CP-net.

This chapter focuses on exactly this challenge, drawing on the co-authors' experience of teaching several such undergraduate courses on agents and multi-agents, over the last three years at two different universities. The chapter outlines three key issues that must be addressed. The first issue is facilitating students' intuitive understanding of fundamental concepts of multi-agent systems; the authors illustrate uses of science fiction materials and classroom games to not only provide students with the necessary intuitive understanding but with the excitement and motivation for studying multi-agent systems. The second is in selecting the right material - either science-fiction material or games - for providing students the necessary motivation and intuition; we outline several criteria that have been useful in selecting such material. The third issue is in educating students about the fundamental philosophical, ethical and social issues surrounding agents and multi-agent systems:they outline course materials and classroom activities that allow students to obtain this ""big picture"" futuristic vision of our science.

The evaluation of knowledge that stems out from logic programs becomes a point of research. The Quality-of-Information concept demonstrated their applicability in many dynamic environments and for decision making purposes.

The key of our framework involves the utilization of a support vector regression (SVR) to learn the correlation between brain image appearances and their corresponding shape deformations to a template, for helping significantly cut down the computation cost and improve the robustness to local minima by using the learned correlation to instantly predict a good subject-specific deformation initialization for any given subject under registration. Our framework consists of three major parts: 1) training of SVR models based on the statistics of image samples and their shape deformations to capture intrinsic image-deformation correlations, 2) deformation prediction for a new subject with the trained SVR models to generate a subject-resemblance intermediate template by warping the original template with the predicted deformations, and 3) estimating of the residual deformation from the intermediate template to the subject for refined registration. Any existing deformable registration methods can be easily employed for training the SVR models and estimating the residual deformation. We have tested in this paper the two widely used deformable registration algorithms, i.e., HAMMER] and diffeomorphic demons, for demonstration of our proposed frameowrk. Experimental results show that, compared to the registration using the original methods (with no deformation prediction), our framework achieves a significant speedup (6X faster than HAMMER, and 3X faster than diffeomorphic demons), while maintaining comparable (or even slighly better) registration accuracy.",,"algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; histology; human; image enhancement; image subtraction; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique"

However, we prove a surprising result that finding a simultaneous matching on a convex bipartite graph takes just polynomial time. Based on this theoretical result, we provide the first polynomial time bound consistency algorithm for the conjunction of two ALLDIFFERENT constraints.

These sensors can be deployed in unknown and possibly hostile environments, where uncertainty and dynamism are endemic. Such environments are common in the areas of disaster response and military surveillance. Our coordination approach itself is based on work by Stranders et al. (2009), that uses the max-sum algorithm to coordinate mobile sensors for monitoring spatial phenomena. In particular, we generalise and extend their approach to any domain where measurements can be valued. Also, we introduce a clustering approach that allows sensors to negotiate over paths to the most relevant locations, as opposed to a set of fixed directions, which results in a significantly improved performance. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to two challenging and distinct information gathering tasks. In the first-pursuit-evasion (PE)-sensors need to capture a target whose movement might be unknown. In the second-patrolling (P)-sensors need to minimise loss from intrusions that occur within their environment. In doing so, we obtain the first decentralised coordination algorithms for these domains.

However, the scientific evaluation of computational strategies for human-computer decision-making is a costly process, involving time, effort and personnel. This paper investigates the use of Peer Designed Agents (PDA)-computer agents developed by human subjects-as a tool for facilitating the evaluation process of automatic negotiators that were developed by researchers. It compares the performance between automatic negotiators that interacted with PDAs to automatic negotiators that interacted with actual people in different domains. The experiments included more than 300 human subjects and 50 PDAs developed by students. Results showed that the automatic negotiators outperformed PDAs in the same situations in which they outperformed people, and that on average, they exhibited the same measure of generosity towards their negotiation partners. These patterns occurred for all types of domains, and for all types of automated negotiators, despite the fact that there were individual differences between the behavior of PDAs and people. The study thus provides an empirical proof that PDAs can alleviate the evaluation process of automatic negotiators, and facilitate their design.

In such situations, agents' individual preferences over available alternatives may vary, and they may try to reconcile these differences by voting. Based on the fact that agents may have incentives to vote strategically and misreport their real preferences, a number of recent papers have explored different possibilities for avoiding or eliminating such manipulations. In contrast to most prior work, this paper focuses on convergence of strategic behavior to a decision from which no voter will want to deviate. We consider scenarios where voters cannot coordinate their actions, but are allowed to change their vote after observing the current outcome. We focus on the Plurality voting rule, and study the conditions under which this iterative game is guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium (i.e., to a decision that is stable against further unilateral manipulations). We show for the first time how convergence depends on the exact attributes of the game, such as the tie-breaking scheme, and on assumptions regarding agents' weights and strategies.

Since the learner has a budget, the problem's duration is finite. Consequently an optimal exploitation policy is not to pull the optimal arm repeatedly, but to pull the combination of arms that maximises the agent's total reward within the budget. As such, the rewards for all arms must be estimated, because any of them may appear in the optimal combination. This difference from existing MABs means that new approaches to maximising the total reward are required. To this end, we propose an ε-first algorithm, in which the first ε of the budget is used solely to learn the arms' rewards (exploration), while the remaining I - ε is used to maximise the received reward based on those estimates (exploitation). We derive bounds on the algorithm's loss for generic and uniform exploration methods, and compare its performance with traditional MAB algorithms under various distributions of rewards and costs, showing that it outperforms the others by up to 50%.

Since intelligent attackers may observe and exploit patterns in the allocation, it is crucial that the allocations be randomized. We cast this problem as an attacker-defender Stackelberg game: the defender's goal is to obtain an optimal mixed strategy for allocating resources. The defender's strategy space is exponential in the number of resources, and the attacker's exponential in the network size. Existing algorithms are therefore useless for all but the smallest networks. We present a solution approach based on two key ideas: (i) A polynomial-sized game model obtained via an approximation of the strategy space, solved efficiently using a linear program; (ii) Two efficient techniques that map solutions from the approximate game to the original, with proofs of correctness under certain assumptions.

Work on intentions in multi-agent systems has focused on joint intention models, which characterise the mental state of agents with a shared goal engaged in teamwork. In the absence of shared goals, however, intentions play another crucial role in multi-agent activity: they provide a basis around which agents can mutually coordinate activities. Models based on shared goals do not attempt to account for or explain this role of intentions. In this paper, we present a formal model of multi-agent systems in which belief-desire-intention agents choose their intentions taking into account the intentions of others.

This error surface is viewed as a multi-modal error surface and robust optimization algorithms are required to solve this kind of problem. This paper proposes an ABC algorithm that simulates the foraging behavior of honey bee swarm for model parameter extraction. The performance comparison of both the algorithms (ABC and PSO) are compared with respect to computational time and the quality of solutions (QoS). The simulation results illustrate that these techniques extract accurately the 16-element small signal model parameters of MESFET.

It corresponds to comparing, via fuzzy set inclusion, possibility distributions that are the most specific transforms of the original probability distributions. This partial ordering compares discrete probability distributions in terms of relative peakedness around their mode, and entropy is monotonic with respect to this partial ordering. In fact, all known variants of entropy share this monotonicity. In this paper, this question is studied in the case of unimodal continuous probability densities on the real line, for which a possibility transform around the mode exists. It corresponds to extracting the family of most precise prediction intervals. Comparing such prediction intervals for two densities yields a variant of relative peakedness in the sense of Birnbaum. We show that a generalized form of continuous entropy is monotonic with respect to this form of relative peakedness of densities. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Birnbaum; Continuous density functions; Discrete probability distribution; Generalized entropies; Monotonicity; Partial ordering; Possibility distributions; Prediction interval; Probability densities; Real line; Real vector; Unimodal; Artificial intelligence; Data processing; Entropy; Fuzzy sets; Knowledge based systems; Wavelet transforms; Probability distributions"

Formal concepts are then defined as pairs consisting of a set of objects and a set of properties that mutually characterize each other through a Galois connection. Another Galois connection is also introduced in this setting on the basis of operators induced by a recent possibility theory reading of Formal Concept Analysis. It is shown that this second Galois connection enables us to characterize independent sub-contexts inside the formal context.

Traveling between locations, as well as acquiring the good at any given location consumes from the resources available to the agents (e.g., battery charge). The availability of the good at any given location, as well as the exact cost of acquiring the good at the location is not fully known in advance, and observed only upon physically arriving at the location. However, apriori probabilities on the availability and potential cost are provided. Given such as setting, the problem is to find a strategy/plan that maximizes the probability of acquiring the good while minimizing resource consumption. Sample applications include agents in exploration and patrol missions, e.g., rovers on Mars seeking to mine a specific mineral. Although this model captures many real world scenarios, it has not been investigated so far. We focus on the case where locations are aligned along a path, and study several variants of the problem, analyzing the effects of communication and coordination. For the case that agents can communicate, we present a polynomial algorithm that works for any fixed number of agents.

F-TIMER leverages multiscale tensor regional distributions and local boundaries for hierarchically driving deformable matching of tensor image volumes. Registration is achieved by aligning a set of automatically determined structural landmarks, via solving a soft correspondence problem. Based on the estimated correspondences, thin-plate splines are employed to generate a smooth, topology preserving, and dense transformation, and to avoid arbitrary mapping of non-landmark voxels. To mitigate the problem of local minima, which is common in the estimation of high dimensional transformations, we employ a hierarchical strategy where a small subset of voxels with more distinctive attribute vectors are first deployed as landmarks to estimate a relatively robust low-degrees-of-freedom transformation. As the registration progresses, an increasing number of voxels are permitted to participate in refining the correspondence matching. A scheme as such allows less conservative progression of the correspondence matching towards the optimal solution, and hence results in a faster matching speed. Results indicate that better accuracy can be achieved by F-TIMER, compared with other deformable registration algorithms, with significantly reduced computation time cost of 4-14 folds.",,"algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; elastography; histology; human; image enhancement; image subtraction; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique"

To this end, direct application of information-theoretic entropy measures on image intensity has achieved various successes. However, simplistic voxelwise utilization of image intensity often neglects important contextual information, which can be provided by more comprehensive geometric and statistical features. In this paper, we employ attribute vectors, instead of image intensities, to guide groupwise registration. In particular, for each voxel, the attribute vector is computed from its multiple-scale neighborhoods to capture geometric information at different scales. Moreover, the probability density function (PDF) of each attribute in the vector is then estimated from the local neighborhood, providing a statistical summary of the underlying anatomical structure. For the purpose of registration, Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence is used to measure the PDF dissimilarity of each attribute at corresponding locations of different individual images. By minimizing the overall JS divergence in the whole image space and estimating the deformation field of each image simultaneously, we can eventually register all images and build an unbiased atlas.

It builds upon the max-sum message passing algorithm for decentralised coordination, for which we present two new generic pruning techniques that result in speed-up of up to 92% for 5 sensors. We empirically evaluate our algorithm against several on-line adaptive coordination mechanisms, and report a reduction in root mean squared error up to 50% compared to a greedy strategy.",,"Adaptive coordination; Application domains; Coordination algorithms; Decentralised; Disaster response; Gaussian Processes; Greedy strategies; Information gain; Max-sum algorithm; Message passing algorithm; Mobile sensors; Path-planning; Pruning techniques; Root mean squared errors; Speed-ups; Time constraints; Artificial intelligence; Message passing; Sensors; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Algorithms"

Many voting rules have been shown to be NP-hard to manipulate. However, a number of recent theoretical results suggest that this complexity may only be in the worst-case since manipulation is often easy in practice. In this paper, we show that empirical studies are useful in improving our understanding of this issue. We demonstrate that there is a smooth transition in the probability that a coalition can elect a desired candidate using the veto rule as the size of the manipulating coalition increases. We show that a rescaled probability curve displays a simple and universal form independent of the size of the problem. We argue that manipulation of the veto rule is asymptotically easy for many independent and identically distributed votes even when the coalition of manipulators is critical in size. Based on this argument, we identify a situation in which manipulation is computationally hard. This is when votes are highly correlated and the election is ""hung"". We show, however, that even a single uncorrelated voter is enough to make manipulation easy again.",,"Empirical studies; Highly-correlated; NP-hard; Probability curves; Smooth transitions; Theoretical result; Voting rules; Artificial intelligence; Phase transitions"

We prove that our method is correct and only eliminates symmetric solutions. We also identify some common conditions under which it eliminates all symmetric solutions.

The statistical deformation model is built by principal component analysis (PCA) on a set of training samples of brain deformation fields that warp a selected template image to the individual brain samples. The statistical deformation model is capable of characterizing individual brain deformations by a small number of parameters, which is used to rapidly estimate the brain deformation between the template and a new individual brain image. The estimated deformation is then used to warp the template, thus generating an intermediate template close to the individual brain image. Finally, the shape difference between the intermediate template and the individual brain is estimated by an image registration algorithm, e.g., HAMMER. The overall registration between the template and the individual brain image can be achieved by directly combining the deformation fields that warp the template to the intermediate template, and the intermediate template to the individual brain image. The algorithm has been validated for spatial normalization of both simulated and real magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain images. Compared with HAMMER, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve over five times speedup, with similar registration accuracy and statistical power in detecting brain atrophy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The primary motivation and application of the proposed methodology is statistical analysis of imaging data on the two-dimensional (2D) surface or in the 3D volume for various neuroimaging studies. The existing voxel-wise approach has several major limitations for the analyses of imaging data, underscoring the great need for methodological development. The voxel-wise approach essentially treats all voxels as independent units, whereas neuroimaging data are spatially correlated in nature and spatially contiguous regions of activation with rather sharp edges are usually expected. The initial smoothing step before the voxel-wise approach often blurs the image data near the edges of activated regions and thus it can dramatically increase the numbers of false positives and false negatives. The MARM, which is developed for addressing these limitations, has three key features in the analysis of imaging data: being spatial, being hierarchical, and being adaptive. The MARM builds a small sphere at each location (called voxel) and use these consecutively connected spheres across all voxels to capture spatial dependence among imaging observations. Then, the MARM builds hierarchically nested spheres by increasing the radius of a spherical neighborhood around each voxel and combine all the data in a given radius of each voxel with appropriate weights to adaptively calculate parameter estimates and test statistics. Theoretically, we first establish that the MARM outperforms classical voxel-wise approach. Simulation studies are used to demonstrate the methodology and examine the finite sample performance of the MARM. We apply our methods to the detection of spatial patterns of brain atrophy in a neuroimaging study of Alzheimers disease. Our simulation studies with known ground truth confirm that the MARM significantly outperforms the voxel-wise methods.",,"aged; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; article; artificial intelligence; atrophy; automated pattern recognition; brain; evaluation; female; human; image enhancement; male; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; regression analysis; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; Aged; Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease; Artificial Intelligence; Atrophy; Brain; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Regression Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity"

This logic, called MEL, borrows its axioms from the modal logic KD, but it is an encapsulation of propositional logic rather than an extension thereof. Its semantics is given in terms of subsets of interpretations, and the models of a formula in MEL is a family of such non-empty subsets. It captures the idea that while the consistent epistemic state of an agent about the world is represented by a non-empty subset of possible worlds, the meta-epistemic state of another agent about the former's epistemic state is a family of such subsets. We prove that any family of non-empty subsets of interpretations can be expressed as a single formula in MEL.

Existing prostate biopsy procedures have been mostly focusing on detecting cancer presence. However, they often ignore the potential use of biopsy to estimate cancer volume (CV) and Gleason Score (GS, a cancer grade descriptor), the two surrogate markers for cancer aggressiveness and the two crucial factors for treatment planning. To fill up this vacancy, this paper assumes and demonstrates that, by optimally sampling the spatial patterns of cancer, biopsy procedures can be specifically designed for estimating CV and GS. Our approach combines image analysis and machine learning tools in an atlas-based population study that consists of three steps. First, the spatial distributions of cancer in a patient population are learned, by constructing statistical atlases from histological images of prostate specimens with known cancer ground truths. Then, the optimal biopsy locations are determined in a feature selection formulation, so that biopsy outcomes (either cancer presence or absence) at those locations could be used to differentiate, at the best rate, between the existing specimens having different (high vs. low) CV/GS values. Finally, the optimized biopsy locations are utilized to estimate whether a new-coming prostate cancer patient has high or low CV/GS values, based on a binary classification formulation. The estimation accuracy and the generalization ability are evaluated by the classification rates and the associated receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves in cross validations. The optimized biopsy procedures are also designed to be robust to the almost inevitable needle displacement errors in clinical practice, and are found to be robust to variations in the optimization parameters as well as the training populations. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer volume; Classification; Clinical significance of prostate cancer; Feature selection; Gleason Score; Optimal biopsy; Spatial pattern; Surrogate marker; Targeted biopsy","Cancer volume; Classification; Clinical significance of prostate cancer; Feature selection; Gleason Score; Optimal biopsy; Spatial pattern; Surrogate marker; Targeted biopsy; Estimation; Image analysis; Machine tools; Optimization; Population statistics; Biopsy; tumor marker; adult; article; cancer classification; cancer grading; cancer localization; cancer patient; cancer size; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; disease activity; Gleason score; human; human tissue; machine learning; major clinical study; male; needle biopsy; priority journal; prostate biopsy; prostate cancer; roc curve; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biopsy, Needle; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Prostatic Neoplasms; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity"

The motivation of this work is spatial normalization of MR images from patients with brain tumors in a common stereotaxic space, aiming to pool data from different patients into a common space in order to perform group analyses. Additionally, transfer of structural and functional information from neuroanatomical brain atlases into the individual patient's space can be achieved via the inverse mapping, for the purpose of segmenting brains and facilitating surgical or radiotherapy treatment planning. A method that estimates the brain tissue loss and replacement by tumor is applied for achieving equivalent image content between an atlas and a patient's scan, based on a biomechanical model of tumor growth. Automated estimation of the parameters modeling brain tissue loss and displacement is performed via optimization of an objective function reflecting feature-based similarity and elastic stretching energy, which is optimized in parallel via APPSPACK (Asynchronous Parallel Pattern Search). The results of the method, applied to 21 brain tumor patients, indicate that the registration accuracy is relatively high in areas around the tumor, as well as in the healthy portion of the brain. Also, the calculated deformation in the vicinity of the tumor is shown to correlate highly with expert-defined visual scores indicating the tumor mass effect, thereby potentially leading to an objective approach to quantification of mass effect, which is commonly used in diagnosis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Limited security resources prevent full security coverage at all times, which allows adversaries to observe and exploit patterns in selective patrolling or monitoring; for example, they can plan an attack avoiding existing patrols. Hence, randomized patrolling or monitoring is important, but randomization must provide distinct weights to different actions based on their complex costs and benefits. To this end, this article describes a promising transition of the latest in multiagent algorithms into a deployed application. In particular, it describes a software assistant agent called ARMOR (assistant for randomized monitoring over routes) that casts this patrolling and monitoring problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game, allowing the agent to appropriately weigh the different actions in randomization, as well as uncertainty over adversary types. ARMOR combines two key features. It uses the fastest known solver for Bayesian Stackelberg games called DOBSS, where the dominant mixed strategies enable randomization; and its mixed-initiative-based interface allows users occasionally to adjust or override the automated schedule based on their local constraints. ARMOR has been successfully deployed since August2007 at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to randomize checkpoints on the roadways entering the airport and canine patrol routes within the airport terminals.

Coalitions enable agents to achieve goals that they may not have been able to achieve independently, and encourages resource sharing among agents with different goals. A range of previous studies have found that problems in coalitional games tend to be computationally complex. However, such hardness results consider the entire input as one, ignoring any structural information on the instances. In the case of coalition formation problems, this bundles together several distinct elements of the input, e.g. the agent set, the goal set, the resources, etc. In this paper we reexamine the complexity of coalition formation problems in the coalition resources game model, as a function of their distinct input elements, using the theory of parameterized complexity. The analysis shows that not all parts of the input are created equal, and that many instances of the problem are actually tractable. We show that the problems are TVT in the number of goals, implying that if the number of goals is bounded then an efficient algorithm is available. Similarly, the problems are FVT in the combination of the number of agents and resources, again implying that if these parameters are bounded, then an efficient algorithm is available. On the other hand, the problems are para-ATV hard in the number of resources, implying that even if we bound the number of resources the problems (probably) remain hard. Additionally, we show that most problems are W[l]-hard in the size of the coalition of interest, indicating that there is (probably) no algorithm polynomial in all but the coalition size.

To quantify this loss, we introduce the notion of the Price of Democracy (PoD), which measures the amount of resources needlessly committed to the task(s) at hand. After defining this concept for general coalitional games, we instantiate it in the setting of weighted voting games, a simple but expressive class of coalitional games that can be used to model resource allocation in multiagent scenarios. We approach the problem of forming winning coalitions in this setting from a non-cooperative perspective, and put forward an intuitive deterministic bargaining process, which exhibits no delay of agreement (i.e.. the agents are guaranteed to form a winning coalition in round one) and allows for efficient computation of bargaining strategies. We show a tight bound of 3/2 on the PoD of our process if two rounds of bargaining are allowed, and demonstrate that this bound cannot improve with more rounds. We then generalize our bargaining process to settings where multiple coalitions are allowed to be formed, show that this generalization also exhibits no delay of agreement, and discuss the PoD in such settings.

We consider an environment where human teammates can potentially add information to relax constraint information. As these problems are NP-complete, no polynomial algorithms exist for evaluating the impact of either adding or relaxing a certain constraint will have on the global problem. We present a general approach based on a notion we introduce called problem tightness. Distributed agents use this notion to identify those problems which are not overly constrained and, therefore, will not benefit from additional information that would relax those constraints. Finally, agents apply traditional machine learning methods based on their specific local problem attributes to attempt to identify which of the constrained problems will most benefit from added information. We evaluated this approach within a distributed c-TAEMS scheduling domain and found that this approach was effective overall. © 2009 - IOS Press and the authors.","Adaptive coordination; Localized decisions; Multiagent scheduling","Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Scheduling; Adaptive coordination; Constrained problem; Constraint information; localized decisions; Machine learning methods; Multi-agent planning; Multi-agent scheduling; Polynomial algorithm; Multi agent systems"

In particular, we tackle the social welfare maximisation problem, and derive a novel continuous version of the max-sum algorithm. In order to do so, we represent the utility function of the agents by multivariate piecewise linear functions, which in turn are encoded as simplexes. We then derive analytical solutions for the fundamental operations required to implement the max-sum algorithm (specifically, addition and marginal maximisation of general n-ary piecewise linear functions). We empirically evaluate our approach on a simulated network of wireless, energy constrained sensors that must coordinate their sense/sleep cycles in order to maximise the system-wide probability of event detection. We compare the conventional discrete max-sum algorithm with our novel continuous version, and show that the continuous approach obtains more accurate solutions (up to a 10% increase) with a lower communication overhead (up to half of the total message size).

In particular, we show that many global constraints which are intractable to propagate completely have natural parameters which make them fixed-parameter tractable and which are easy to compute. This tractability tends either to be the result of a simple dynamic program or of a decomposition which has a strong backdoor of bounded size. This strong backdoor is often a cycle cutset. We also show that parameterized complexity can be used to study other aspects of constraint programming like symmetry breaking. For instance, we prove that value symmetry is fixed-parameter tractable to break in the number of symmetries. Finally, we argue that parameterized complexity can be used to derive results about the approximability of constraint propagation.

The cost of acquiring the resource or good at a given source is uncertain (a-priori), and the agent can observe its true value only when physically arriving at the source. Sample applications involving this type of search include agents in exploration and patrol missions (e.g., an agent seeking to find the best location to deploy sensing equipment along its path). The uniqueness of these settings is that the expense of observing the source on each step of the process derives from the last source the agent explored. We analyze three variants of the problem, differing in their objective: minimizing the total expected cost, maximizing the success probability given an initial budget, and minimizing the budget necessary to obtain a given success probability. For each variant, we first introduce and analyze the problem with a single agent, either providing a polynomial solution to the problem or proving it is NP-Complete. We also introduce an innovative fully polynomial time approximation scheme algorithm for the minimum budget variant. Finally, the results for the single agent case are generalized to multi-agent settings. Copyright © 2008, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

What makes this such a challenging problem is that the number of possible solutions grows exponentially as the number of agents increases. To date, two main approaches have been developed to solve this problem, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The state of the art in the first approach is the Improved Dynamic Programming (IDP) algorithm, due to Rahwan and Jennings, that is guaranteed to find an optimal solution in O(3n), but which cannot generate a solution until it has completed its entire execution. The state of the art in the second approach is an anytime algorithm called IP, due to Rahwan et al., that provides worst-case guarantees on the quality of the best solution found so far, but which is O(nn). In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm that combines both IDP and IP, resulting in a hybrid performance that exploits the strength of both algorithms and, at the same, avoids their main weaknesses. Our approach is also significantly faster (e.g. given 25 agents, it takes only 28% of the time required by IP, and 0.3% of the time required by IDP).

Oftentimes, the agents have budget constraints and the auctions have a reserve price, both of which restrict the bids the agents can place. In addition, their attitude need not be risk-neutral and they may have uncertainty about the value of the goods they are buying. Some of these issues have been examined individually for single-unit sealed-bid auctions. In this paper, we extend this analysis to the multi-unit case, and also analyze the multi-unit sealed-bid auctions in which a combination of these issues are present, for unit-demand bidders. This analysis constitutes the main contribution of this paper. We then demonstrate the usefulness in practice of this analysis; we show in simulations that taking into account all these issues allows the bidders to maximize their utility. Furthermore, using this analysis allows a seller to improve her revenue, i.e. by selecting the optimal reserve price.

While Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a state space of continuous and discrete variables are popular for modeling these domains, current algorithms for such MDPs can exhibit poor performance with a scale-up in their state space. To remedy that we propose an algorithm called DPFP. DPFP's key contribution is its exploitation of the dual space cumulative distribution functions. This dual formulation is key to DPFP's novel combination of three features. First, it enables DPFP's membership in a class of algorithms that perform forward search in a large (possibly infinite) policy space. Second, it provides a new and efficient approach for varying the policy generation effort based on the likelihood of reaching different regions of the MDP state space. Third, it yields a bound on the error produced by such approximations. These three features conspire to allow DPFP's superior performance and systematic trade-off of optimality for speed. Our experimental evaluation shows that, when run stand-alone, DPFP outperforms other algorithms in terms of its any-time performance, whereas when run as a hybrid, it allows for a significant speedup of a leading continuous resource MDP solver.

Limited security resources prevent full security coverage at all times, which allows adversaries to observe and exploit patterns in selective patrolling or monitoring, e.g. they can plan an attack avoiding existing patrols. Hence, randomized patrolling or monitoring is important, but randomization must provide distinct weights to different actions based on their complex costs and benefits. To this end, this demonstration showcases a promising transition of the latest in multi-agent algorithms into a deployed application. In particular, it exhibits a software assistant agent called ARMOR (Assistant for Randomized Monitoring over Routes) that casts this patrolling/monitoring problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game, allowing the agent to appropriately weigh the different actions in randomization, as well as uncertainty over adversary types.

Such games are important in security domains, where, for example, a security agent (leader) must commit to a strategy of patrolling certain areas, and an adversary (follower) can observe this strategy over time before choosing where to attack.

COACH is an innovative algorithm designed for building an online handwriting evaluation tool to be used for classifying and remediating handwriting deficiencies. COACH adapts learning and data mining techniques from AI to handwriting deficiency classification in an innovative fashion. Until now handwriting classification has been performed manually by trained therapists causing expensive and subjective evaluation. This application lowers the cost of evaluation, increases objectiveness, and enables repeated testing that can accompany therapy. COACH is evaluated on real data obtained from children with poor handwriting using a digitizer tablet. Results show that COACH manages to successfully differentiate between poor to proficient handwriting. Differentiation is obtained even after using data from only a few words. These results prove that COACH is a promising emerging application for online evaluation.

We consider two formal models of observation-based causation, which differ in the way they represent uncertainty. The quantitative model uses a standard probabilistic definition; the qualitative model uses a definition based on nonmonotonic consequence. The two models identify different sufficient conditions for the transitivity of causation: The Markov condition on events for the quantitative model, and a Saliency condition (if B is true then generally A is true) for the qualitative model. We explore the formal relations between these sufficient conditions, and between the underlying definitions of observation-based causation.

We study here the complexity of determining when we can terminate eliciting preferences, and prove that the complexity depends on the elicitation strategy. We show, for instance, that it may be better from a computational perspective to elicit all preferences from one agent at a time than to elicit individual preferences from multiple agents. We also study the connection between the strategic manipulation of an election and preference elicitation. We show that what we can manipulate affects the computational complexity of manipulation. In particular, we prove that there are voting rules which are easy to manipulate if we can change all of an agent's vote, but computationally intractable if we can change only some of their preferences. This suggests that, as with preference elicitation, a fine-grained view of manipulation may be informative. Finally, we study the connection between predicting the winner of an election and preference elicitation. Based on this connection, we identify a voting rule where it is computationally difficult to decide the probability of a candidate winning given a probability distribution over the votes.

The geometric feature is derived from the structural geometry of diffusion and characterizes the shape of the tensor in terms of prolateness, oblateness, and sphericity of the tensor. Local spatial distributions of the prolate, oblate, and spherical geometry are used to create an attribute vector of geometric feature for matching. The orientation feature improves the matching of the WM fiber tracts by taking into account the statistical information of underlying fiber orientations. These features are incorporated into a hierarchical deformable registration framework to develop a diffusion tensor image registration algorithm. Extensive experiments on simulated and real brain DT data establish the superiority of this algorithm for deformable matching of diffusion tensors, thereby aiding in atlas creation. The robustness of the method makes it potentially useful for group-based analysis of DT images acquired in large studies to identify disease-induced and developmental changes.",,"algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; diffusion weighted imaging; histology; image enhancement; image subtraction; methodology; myelinated nerve; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; ultrastructure; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Nerve Fibers, Myelinated; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique"

To better segment parenchyma, we perform segmentation on estimated tissue property T1 map. To improve the estimation of tissue property (T1) which is the basis for parenchyma segmentation, we present an integrated algorithm for simultaneous T1 map estimation, T1 map based parenchyma segmentation and group-wise registration on series of inversion recovery magnetic resonance (MR) breast images. The advantage of using this integrated algorithm is that the simultaneous T1 map estimation (E-step) and group-wise registration (R-step) could benefit each other and jointly improve parenchyma segmentation. In particular, in E-step, T1 map based segmentation could help perform an edge-preserving smoothing on the tentatively estimated noisy T1 map, and could also help provide tissue probability maps to be robustly registered in R-step. Meanwhile, the improved estimation of T1 map could help segment parenchyma in a more accurate way. In R-step, for robust registration, the group-wise registration is performed on the tissue probability maps produced in E-step, rather than the original inversion recovery MR images, since tissue probability maps are the intrinsic tissue property which is invariant to the use of different imaging parameters. The better alignment of images achieved in R-step can help improve T1 map estimation and indirectly the T1 map based parenchyma segmentation. By iteratively performing E-step and R-step, we can simultaneously obtain better results for T1 map estimation, T1 map based segmentation, group-wise registration, and finally parenchyma segmentation.",,"algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; breast; breast tumor; computer assisted diagnosis; female; human; image enhancement; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity"

Since some testing samples can be similar to only sub-population of training samples, it will be more effective if particular shape statistics extracted from the respective sub-population can be used for guiding image segmentation. Accordingly, we design a set of hierarchical shape statistical models, including a whole-population shape model and a series of sub-population models. The whole-population shape model is used to guide the initial segmentation of the testing sample, and the initial segmentation result is then used to select a suitable sub-population shape model according to the shape similarity between the testing sample and each sub-population. By using the selected subpopulation shape model, the segmentation result can be further refined. To achieve this segmentation process, several particular steps are designed next. First, all linearly aligned samples in the whole population are used to generate a whole-population shape model. Second, an affinity propagation method is used to cluster all linearly aligned samples into several clusters, to determine the samples belonging to the same sub-populations. Third, the original samples of each sub-population are linearly aligned to their own mean shape, and the respective sub-population shape model is built using the newly aligned samples in this sub-population. By using all these three steps, we can generate hierarchical shape statistical models to guide image segmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the segmentation performance, compared to conventional ASM.",,"algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biological model; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; image quality; lung; methodology; radiography; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; thorax radiography; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Lung; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Radiography, Thoracic; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity"

The methods focus on the online behaviour of the backtracking solver, as well as the structure of the problem. Modern SAT solvers present several challenges to estimate search cost including coping with non-chronological backtracking, learning and restarts. Our first method adapt an existing algorithm for estimating the size of a search tree to deal with these challenges. We then suggest a second method that uses a linear model trained on data gathered online at the start of search. We compare the effectiveness of these two methods using random and structured problems. We also demonstrate that predictions made in early restarts can be used to improve later predictions. We conclude by showing that the cost of solving a set of problems can be reduced by selecting a solver from a portfolio based on such cost estimations.

Existing algorithms for Bayesian Stackelberg games find optimal solutions while modeling uncertainty over follower types with an a-priori probability distribution. Unfortunately, in real-world applications, the leader may also face uncertainty over the follower's response which makes the optimality guarantees of these algorithms fail. Such uncertainty arises because the follower's specific preferences or the follower's observations of the leader's strategy may not align with the rational strategy, and it is not amenable to a-priori probability distributions. These conditions especially hold when dealing with human subjects. To address these uncertainties while providing quality guarantees, we propose three new robust algorithms based on mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) for Bayesian Stackelberg games. A key result of this paper is a detailed experimental analysis that demonstrates that these new MILPs deal better with human responses: a conclusion based on 800 games with 57 human subjects as followers. We also provide run-time results on these MILPs.

Incompleteness in the agents' preferences is common in many real-life settings due to privacy issues or an ongoing elicitation process. In addition, there may be uncertainty about how the preferences are aggregated. For example, the agenda (a tree whose leaves are labelled with the decisions being compared) may not yet be known or fixed. We therefore study how to determine collectively optimal decisions (also called winners) when preferences may be incomplete, and when the agenda may be uncertain. We show that it is computationally easy to determine if a candidate decision always wins, or may win, whatever the agenda. On the other hand, it is computationally hard to know whether a candidate decision wins in at least one agenda for at least one completion of the agents' preferences. These results hold even if the agenda must be balanced so that each candidate decision faces the same number of majority votes. Such results are useful for reasoning about preference elicitation. They help understand the complexity of tasks such as determining if a decision can be taken collectively, as well as knowing if the winner can be manipulated by appropriately ordering the agenda.

One major factor is also the lack of bold new vision and excitement about computer science, which thus results in a view of computer science as a field wedded to routine programming. To address this concern, we have focused on science fiction as a means to generate excitement about Artificial Intelligence, and thus in turn in Computer Science and Engineering. In particular, since the Fall of 2006, we have used science fiction in teaching Artificial Intelligence to undergraduate students at the University of Southern California (USC), in teaching activities ranging from an undergraduate upper division class in computer science to a semester-long freshman seminar for non-engineering students to micro-seminars during the welcome week. As an interdisciplinary team of scholar/instructors, our goal has been to use science fiction not only in motivating students to learn about AI, but also to use science fiction in understanding fundamental issues that arise at the intersection of technology and culture, as well as to provide students with a more creative and well-rounded course that provided a big picture view of computer science. This paper outlines the courses taught using this theme, provides an overview of our classroom teaching techniques in using science fiction, and discusses some of the lectures in more detail as exemplars.

First, a PCA-based statistical deformation model is constructed using the deformation fields obtained by conventional registration algorithms between a template image and training subject images. Then, the constructed statistical model is used to generate a large number of sample deformation fields by resampling in the PCA space. In the meanwhile, by warping the template using these sample deformation fields, the respective sample images in the PCA space can be also generated. Finally, after learning the correlation between the features of the sample images and their deformation coefficients, given a new test image, we can immediately estimate its relative deformations to the template based on its image information. Using this estimated deformation, we can warp the template to generate an intermediate template close to the test image. Since the intermediate template is more similar to the test image compared to the original template, the registration via the intermediate template becomes much easier and faster. Experimental results show that the proposed learning-based registration method can fast register MR brain image with robust performance. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Education; Estimation; Feature extraction; Image enhancement; Image processing; Mathematical models; Pattern recognition; Principal component analysis; Statistical methods; Testing; Weaving; Brain imaging; Deformation coefficients; Deformation fields; Estimation methods; Image informations; Non-rigid registration; Re-sampling; Registration algorithms; Registration methods; Robust performance; Sample deformation; Statistical deformation model; Statistical modelling; Template images; Test images; Deformation"

The rough set reduction technique is applied to find all the reducts of the data which contains the minimal subset of attributes that are associated with a class label for prediction. Finally, rough sets dependency rules are generated directly from all generated reducts. Rough confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the predicted reducts and classes.

Given that agents are spread across such a network, agents directly interact only with a small group of neighbors. A distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) is a useful framework to reason about such networks of agents. Given agents' inability to communicate and collaborate in large groups in such networks, we focus on an, approach called k-optimality for solving DCOPs. In this approach, agents form groups or one or more agents until no group of k or fewer agents can possibly improve the DCOP solution; we define this type of local optimum, and any algorithm guaranteed to reach such a local optimum, as k-optimal. The article provides an overview of three key results related to k-optimality. The first set of results gives worst-case guarantees on the solution quality of k-optima in a DCOP. These guarantees can help determine an appropriate k-optimal algorithm, orpossibly an appropriate constraint graph structure, for agents to use in situations where the cost of coordination between agents must be weighed against the quality of the solution reached. The second set of results gives upper bounds on the number of k-optima that can exist in a DCOP. These results are useful in domains where a DCOP must generate a set of solutions rather than a single solution. Finally, we sketch algorithms for k-optimality and provide some experimental results for 1-, 2- and 3-optimal algorithms for several types of DCOPs.

The registration is facilitated by first simulating the tumor mass effect in the normal atlas in order to create an atlas image that is as similar as possible to the patient's image. An optimization framework is used to optimize the location of tumor seed as well as other parameters of the tumor growth model, based on the pattern of deformation around the tumor region. In particular, the optimization is implemented in a multiresolution and hierarchical scheme, and it is accelerated by using a principal component analysis (PCA)-based model of tumor growth and mass effect, trained on a computationally more expensive biomechanical model. Validation on simulated and real images shows that the proposed registration framework, referred to as ORBIT (optimization of tumor parameters and registration of brain images with tumors), outperforms other available registration methods particularly for the regions close to the tumor, and it has the potential to assist in constructing statistical atlases from tumor-diseased brain images. © 2008 IEEE.","Atlas registration; Brain tumor; Deformable registration; Image attributes; Tumor growth model","Biomechanics; Deformation; Financial data processing; Image enhancement; Maps; Multiresolution analysis; Optimization; Orbits; Principal component analysis; Statistical methods; Atlas registration; Biomechanical modelling; Brain atlas; Brain imaging; Brain tumor; Brain tumors; Deformable registration; Hierarchical scheme; Image attributes; Mass effects; Multi resolutions; Optimization framework; Principal component analysis (PCA); Real images; Registration methods; Tumor growth; Tumor growth model; Tumor mass; Tumors; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; brain tumor; computer assisted diagnosis; computer program; human; image enhancement; image subtraction; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain Neoplasms; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Software; Subtraction Technique"

An evolutionary computation technique is applied to solve the problem obtained by transforming the system into a multiobjective optimization problem. The results obtained are compared with a very new technique that is considered as efficient and is also compared with some of the standard techniques that are used for solving nonlinear equations systems. Several well-known and difficult applications (such as interval arithmetic benchmark, kinematic application, neuropsychology application, combustion application, and chemical equilibrium application) are considered for testing the performance of the new approach.

Many of these interactions involve negotiating over a desired outcome. Negotiation in and of itself is not an easy task, and it becomes more complex under conditions of incomplete information. For example, the parties do not know in advance the exact tradeoff of their counterparts between different outcomes. Furthermore information regarding the preferences of counterparts might only be elicited during the negotiation process itself. In this paper we propose a model for an automated negotiation agent capable of negotiating with bounded rational agents under conditions of incomplete information. We test this agent against people in two distinct domains, in order to verify that its model is generic, and thus can be adapted to any domain as long as the negotiators' preferences can be expressed in additive utilities. Our results indicate that the automated agent reaches more agreements and plays more effectively than its human counterparts. Moreover, in most of the cases, the automated agent achieves significantly better agreements, in terms of individual utility, than the human counterparts playing the same role. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

There are two novelties in the proposed deformable model. First, a modified scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) local descriptor, which is more distinctive than the general intensity and gradient features, is used to characterize the image features in the vicinity of each pixel. Second, the deformable contour is constrained by both population-based and patient-specific shape statistics, and it yields more robust and accurate segmentation of lung fields for serial chest radiographs. In particular, for segmenting the initial time-point images, the population-based shape statistics is used to constrain the deformable contour; as more subsequent images of the same patient are acquired, the patient-specific shape statistics online collected from the previous segmentation results gradually takes more roles. Thus, this patient-specific shape statistics is updated each time when a new segmentation result is obtained, and it is further used to refine the segmentation results of all the available time-point images. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more robust and accurate than other active shape models in segmenting the lung fields from serial chest radiographs. © 2006 IEEE.","Deformable model; Scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) local descriptor; Segmentation; Serial chest radiographs; Shape statistics","Medical imaging; Pixels; Population statistics; Radiography; Respiratory mechanics; Deformable model; Scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) local descriptor; Serial chest radiographs; Shape statistics; Image segmentation; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biological model; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; human; image quality; image subtraction; lung; methodology; radiography; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical analysis; statistical model; thorax radiography; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Lung; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Radiography, Thoracic; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique"

To solve at once problems and difficulties that arise during the learning process, we need to develop technologies and tools that allow the monitoring of those paths, if not in real time, at least periodically. Supported on a knowledge base of student features, also called a Student Model, a Student Assessment System must be able to produce diagnosis of student's learning paths. Given the wide range of students' learning experiences and behaviours, which implies a wide range of points and values in students' models, such a tool should have some sort of intelligence. Moreover, that tool must rely on a formal methodology for problem solving to estimate a measure of the quality-of-information that branches out from students' profiles, before trying to diagnose their learning problems. Indeed, this paper presents an approach to design a Diagnosis Module for a Student Assessment System, which is, in fact, a reasoner, in the sense that, presented with a new problem description (a student outline) it produces a solved problem, i.e., a diagnostic of the student learning state. We undertook the problem by selecting the attributes that are meaningful to produce a diagnosis, i.e., biographical, social, economical and cultural data, as well as skills so far achieved, which may drive, as constraints or invariants, the acquisition of new knowledge. Next, we selected the metrics that would allow us to infer the quality of the ongoing learning, i.e., the degree of expertise on the currently attended learning domains. To collect these indicators we used the Moodle e-Learning System. Both, attributes and metrics, make the student model. Finally, we designed a reasoner based on Artificial Intelligence techniques that rely on the Quality-of-Information quantification valuations to foster a Multi-Valued Extended Logic Programming language, a key element in order to produce diagnosis of the student learning paths. Confronted with a new case, i.e., a student model, the reasoner evaluates it in terms of its QI and outputs a diagnostic.","Artificial intelligence; MOODLE; Multi-valued extended logic programming; Quality-ofinformation; Rule based programming","Artificial intelligence; Digital storage; E-learning; Knowledge based systems; Learning systems; Logic programming; Problem oriented languages; Problem solving; Tools; Artificial intelligence techniques; Artificial intelligence tools; Extended logic programming; Market requirements; MOODLE; Professional schools; Quality-ofinformation; Students' learning experiences; Students"

Now, the equilibrium bids for such auctions depend on the information uncertainty of the bidders. Specifically, there are three key auction parameters that the bidders could be uncertain about: the valuations of the objects for sale, the number of objects for sale, and the number of participating bidders. We analyse the bidding behaviour for each of these three sources of uncertainty. For each setting, we first find the equilibrium bidding strategies for the individual auctions that comprise a series. Then we analyze the effect of these uncertainties on the computational and economic properties of the equilibrium solution. The former analysis is essential if we want to use software agents to bid on our behalf. The latter is essential because both the auctioneer and the bidders want to know how these uncertainties affect their profits. Thus we compare the outcomes for these settings from the perspective of the bidders (i.e., in terms of their profits), from the perspective of the auctioneer (i.e., in terms of his revenue), and from a global perspective (i.e., in terms of auction efficiency). © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Profitability; Software agents; Equilibrium bidding strategies; Equilibrium solutions; Global perspective; Sequential auctions; Sources of uncertainty; Uncertain informations; Uncertainty analysis"

Given the significant computational complexity of solving distributed POMDPs, one popular approach has focused on approximate solutions. Though this approach provides for efficient computation of solutions, the algorithms within this approach do not provide any guarantees on the quality of the solutions. A second less popular approach has focused on a global optimal result, but at considerable computational cost. This paper overcomes the limitations of both these approaches by providing SPIDER (Search for Policies In Distributed EnviRonments), which provides quality-guaranteed approximations for distributed POMDPs.

This paper focuses on domains where these threats come from unknown adversaries. These domains can be modeled as Bayesian games; much work has been done on finding equilibria for such games. However, it is often the case in multiagent security domains that one agent can commit to a mixed strategy which its adversaries observe before choosing their own strategies. In this case, the agent can maximize reward by finding an optimal strategy, without requiring equilibrium. Previous work has shown this problem of optimal strategy selection to be NP-hard. Therefore, we present a heuristic called ASAP, with three key advantages to address the problem. First, ASAP searches for the highest-reward strategy, rather than a Bayes-Nash equilibrium, allowing it to find feasible strategies that exploit the natural first-mover advantage of the game. Second, it provides strategies which are simple to understand, represent, and implement. Third, it operates directly on the compact, Bayesian game representation, without requiring conversion to normal form. We provide an efficient Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) implementation for ASAP, along with experimental results illustrating significant speedups and higher rewards over other approaches.

We posit that these existing approaches are each best suited for different types of queries. We present PHIRST, the first system to facilitate effective full-text search within P2P networks. PHIRST works by effectively leveraging between the relative strengths of these approaches. Similar to structured approaches, agents first publish terms within their stored documents. However, frequent terms are quickly identified and not exhaustively stored, resulting in a significantly reduction in the system's storage requirements. During query lookup, agents use unstructured searches to compensate for the lack of fully published terms. Additionally, they explicitly weigh between the costs involved with structured and unstructured approaches, allowing for a significant reduction in query costs.

By designing a drug we mean to choose some variables of drug formulation (inputs), for obtaining optimal characteristics of drug (outputs). To solve such a problem we propose a neuro-fuzzy model and the performance is compared with artificial neural networks. This research used the experimental data obtained from the Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Techniques of the Faculty of Pharmacy in ClujNapoca, Romania. The idea is to build a multi-input -multi-output neuro-fuzzy model depicting the dependence between inputs and outputs. A first order Takagi-Sugeno type fuzzy inference system is developed and it is fine tuned using neural network learning techniques. Bootstrap techniques were used to generate more samples of data and the number of experimental data is reduced due to the costs and time durations of experimentations.

In the field of contracting, through Intelligent Electronic Agents, there is an imperious need of analysing the question of expression of consent, and two main possibilities have been proposed: considering electronic devices as mere machines or tools, or considering electronic devices as legal persons. Another possibility that has been frequently mentioned consists in the application of the rules of agency to electronic transactions. Meanwhile, the question remains: would it possible, under a Civil Law framework, to apply the notions of ""legal personhood"" and ""representation"" to electronic agents?

These planning problems can be modeled with continuous state Markov decision processes (MDPs) but existing solution methods are either inefficient or provide no guarantee on the quality of the resulting policy. We therefore present CPH, a novel solution method that solves the planning problems by first approximating with any desired accuracy the probability distributions over the resource consumptions with phase-type distributions, which use exponential distributions as building blocks. It then uses value iteration to solve the resulting MDPs by exploiting properties of exponential distributions to calculate the necessary convolutions accurately and efficiently while providing strong guarantees on the quality of the resulting policy. Our experimental feasibility study in a Mars rover domain demonstrates a substantial speedup over Lazy Approximation, which is currently the leading algorithm for solving continuous state MDPs with quality guarantees.",,"Algorithm for solving; Analytical algorithms; Continuous state; Exponential distributions; Feasibility studies; Markov Decision Processes; Phase type distributions; Resource consumption; Approximation algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Markov processes; Probability distributions; Iterative methods"

Unlike existing techniques, our technique guarantees the resulting policy will meet this bound. Furthermore, it does not require costly computations to determine the quality loss of the policy. Our second technique prunes large tracts of belief space that are unreachable, allowing faster policy computation without any sacrifice in optimality.

As we show throughout the paper, this strategy is always favorable in comparison to currently known cooperative and autonomous search techniques: it has the potential to significantly improve the searchers' performance in various environments and in any case guarantees reaching at least as good a performance as that of other known methods. Furthermore, for many common environments we manage to significantly eliminate the consequential added computational complexity associated with the partitioning option, by introducing innovative efficient algorithms for extracting the coalition's optimal search strategy.

We show that in the case of two sellers with asymmetric production costs, there exists a pure Nash equilibrium in which both sellers set reserve prices above their production costs. In addition, we show that, rather than setting a reserve price, a seller can further improve its utility by shill bidding (i.e., bidding as a buyer in its own auction). This shill bidding is undesirable as it introduces inefficiencies within the market. However, through the use of an evolutionary simulation, we extend the analytical results beyond the two-seller case, and we then show that these inefficiencies can be effectively reduced when the mediating auction institution uses auction fees based on the difference between the auction closing and reserve prices.",,"Analytical results; Evolutionary simulations; Online auctions; Online markets; Production cost; Pure Nash equilibrium; Reserve price; Shill biddings; Artificial intelligence; Electronic commerce; Sales; Costs"

The de-enhanced images are then registered by conventional B-spline based registration algorithm. These two steps benefit from each other and are repeated until the results converge. Experimental results show that our two-step registration algorithm performs much better than conventional mutual information based registration algorithm. Also, the effects of tumor shrinking in the conventional registration algorithms can be effectively avoided by our registration algorithm.",,"contrast medium; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; breast; breast tumor; computer assisted diagnosis; female; human; image enhancement; image subtraction; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Contrast Media; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique"

When these agents negotiate with each other they reach a pareto-optimal solution that is mutually beneficial. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate the superiority of providing such agents for humans over supplying equilibrium agents or letting people design their own agents. These results are based on our observation that most people do not modify SC agents even though they are not in equilibrium.

We use the B-Spline-based nonrigid transformation to model the lung deformation while imposing rigid transformation on the tumor to preserve the volume and the shape of the tumor. In particular, we set the control points within the tumor to form a control mesh and thus assume the tumor region follows the same rigid transformation as the control mesh. For segmentation, we apply a 2D graph-cut algorithm on the 3D lung and tumor datasets. By iteratively performing segmentation and registration, our method achieves highly accurate segmentation and registration on serial CT data.

In this paper, we propose a new framework for accurate characterization of tumors in contrast enhanced MR images. First, a new graph cut based segmentation algorithm is developed for refining coarse manual segmentation, which allows precise identification of tumor regions. Second, by considering serial contrast-enhanced images as a single spatio-temporal image, a spatio-temporal model of segmented tumor is constructed to extract Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Patterns (STEPs). STEPs are designed to capture not only dynamic enhancement and architectural features, but also spatial variations of pixel-wise temporal enhancement of the tumor. While temporal enhancement features are extracted through Fourier transform, the resulting STEP framework captures spatial patterns of temporal enhancement features via moment invariants and rotation invariant Gabor textures. High accuracy of the proposed framework is a direct consequence of this two pronged approach, which is validated through experiments yielding, for instance, an area of 0.97 under the ROC curve.",,"contrast medium; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; breast tumor; computer assisted diagnosis; female; human; image enhancement; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Breast Neoplasms; Contrast Media; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity"

Based on self-organized computational approaches and similar stigmergic concepts we derive a novel swarm intelligent algorithm. What strikes from these observations is that both eusocial insects as ant colonies and bacteria have similar natural mechanisms based on stigmergy in order to emerge coherent and sophisticated patterns of global collective behaviour. Keeping in mind the above characteristics we will present a simple model to tackle the collective adaptation of a social swarm based on real ant colony behaviors (SSA algorithm) for tracking extrema in dynamic environments and highly multimodal complex functions described in the well-know DeJong test suite. Then, for the purpose of comparison, a recent model of artificial bacterial foraging (BFOA algorithm) based on similar stigmergic features is described and analyzed. Final results indicate that the SSA collective intelligence is able to cope and quickly adapt to unforeseen situations even when over the same cooperative foraging period, the community is requested to deal with two different and contradictory purposes, while outperforming BFOA in adaptive speed. Results indicate that the present approach deals well in severe Dynamic Optimization problems. © 2007 IEEE.","Distributed search and optimization in dynamic environments; Self-organization; Social cognitive maps; Social foraging; Swarm intelligence and perception","Multicellular organisms; Social cognitive maps; Swarm intelligence; Behavioral research; Cognitive systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Self organizing maps; Bacteria"

More specifically, we show that service provisioning is NP-hard, and then devise two heuristic strategies that use service redundancy in a flexible manner to address uncertainty and failure.

To increase prostate cancer diagnostic rate, needles are expected to be deployed at suspicious cancer locations. High-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides a powerful tool for detecting suspicious cancerous tissues. To do this, MR appearances of cancerous tissue should be characterized and learned from a sufficient number of prostate MR images with known cancer information. However, ground-truth cancer information is only available in histologic images. Therefore it is necessary to warp ground-truth cancerous regions in histological images to MR images by a registration procedure. The objective of this article is to develop a registration technique for aligning histological and MR images of the same prostate. Material and Methods: Five pairs of histological and T2-weighted MR images of radical prostatectomy specimens are collected. For each pair, registration is guided by two sets of correspondences that can be reliably established on prostate boundaries and internal salient bloblike structures of histologic and MR images. Results: Our developed registration method can accurately register histologic and MR images. It yields results comparable to manual registration, in terms of landmark distance and volume overlap. It also outperforms both affine registration and boundary-guided registration methods. Conclusions: We have developed a novel method for deformable registration of histologic and MR images of the same prostate. Besides the collection of ground-truth cancer information in MR images, the method has other potential applications. An automatic, accurate registration of histologic and MR images actually builds a bridge between in vivo anatomical information and ex vivo pathologic information, which is valuable for various clinical studies. © 2007 AUR.","biopsy; deformable registration; histologic image; MR image; Prostate cancer","article; cancer diagnosis; cancer registry; clinical article; histology; human; human tissue; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; tumor biopsy; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biopsy; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Prostatic Neoplasms; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique"

In this framework, the entire brain is first adaptively partitioned into a number of brain regions, and then the best features are learned for each of these brain regions. In order to obtain overall better performance for both of these two steps, they are integrated into a single framework and solved together by iteratively performing region partition and learning the best features for each partitioned region. In particular, the learned best features for each brain region are required to be identical, and maximally salient as well as consistent over all individual brains, thus facilitating the correspondence detection between individual brains during the registration procedure. Moreover, the importance of each brain point in registration is evaluated according to the distinctiveness and consistency of its respective best features, therefore the salient points with distinctive and consistent features can be hierarchically selected to steer the registration process and reduce the risk of being trapped in local minima.

First, a regional statistical feature extraction scheme was adopted to capture discriminative features from voxel-wise morphometric and functional representations of brain images, in order to reduce the dimensionality of the features used for classification, as well as to achieve the robustness to registration error and inter-subject variations. Then, this feature extraction method was used in conjunction with a hybrid feature selection method and a nonlinear support vector machine for the classification of brain abnormalities. This brain classification approach has been applied to detecting the brain abnormality associated with prenatal cocaine exposure in adolescents. A promising classification performance was achieved on a data set of 49 subjects (24 normal and 25 prenatally cocaine-exposed teenagers), with a leave-one-out cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of our method, as well as the importance of incorporating both structural and functional images for brain classification. Moreover, spatial patterns of group difference derived from the constructed classifier were mostly consistent with the results of the conventional statistical analysis method. Therefore, the proposed approach provided not only a multivariate classification method for detecting brain abnormalities, but also an alternative way for group analysis of multimodality images. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This method consists of three major steps. First, a statistical atlas of the spatial distribution of prostate cancer is constructed from histological images obtained from radical prostatectomy specimen. Second, a probabilistic optimization framework is employed to optimize the biopsy strategy, so that the probability of cancer detection is maximized under needle placement uncertainties. Finally, the optimized biopsy strategy generated in the atlas space is mapped to a specific patient space using an automated segmentation and elastic registration method. Cross-validation experiments showed that the predictive power of the optimized biopsy strategy for cancer detection reached the 94%-96% levels for 6-7 biopsy cores, which is significantly better than standard random-systematic biopsy protocols, thereby encouraging further investigation of optimized biopsy strategies in prospective clinical studies. © 2007 IEEE.","Biopsy optimization; Prostate cancer; Spatial normalization; Statistical image analysis","Conformal mapping; Image registration; Optimization; Probability; Statistical methods; Tumors; Biopsy optimization; Prostate cancer; Spatial normalization; Statistical image analysis; Medical imaging; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; evaluation; human; image enhancement; male; methodology; needle biopsy; pathology; prostate; prostate tumor; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical analysis; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biopsy, Needle; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Male; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Prostate; Prostatic Neoplasms; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity"

Now, in cases where these individual ratings are not in complete agreement, the overall rating should be somewhere in between the extremes that have been suggested. However, there are many possibilities for the aggregated value. Given this, this paper systematically explores the space of possible compromise operators for such multi-attribute decision making problems. Specifically, we axiomatically identify the complete spectrum of such operators in terms of the properties they should satisfy, and show the main ones that are widely used-namely averaging operators, uninorms and nullnorms-represent only three of the nine types we identify. For each type, we then go onto analyse their properties and discuss how specific instances can actually be developed. Finally, to illustrate the richness of our framework, we show how a wide range of operators are needed to model the various attitudes that a user may have for aggregation in a given scenario (bidding in multi-attribute auctions). © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A morphological representation of the anatomy of interest is first obtained using a high-dimensional mass-preserving template warping method, which results in tissue density maps that constitute local tissue volumetric measurements. Regions that display strong correlations between tissue volume and classification (clinical) variables are extracted using a watershed segmentation algorithm, taking into account the regional smoothness of the correlation map which is estimated by a cross-validation strategy to achieve robustness to outliers. A volume increment algorithm is then applied to these regions to extract regional volumetric features, from which a feature selection technique using support vector machine (SVM)-based criteria is used to select the most discriminative features, according to their effect on the upper bound of the leave-one-out generalization error. Finally, SVM-based classification is applied using the best set of features, and it is tested using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The results on MR brain images of healthy controls and schizophrenia patients demonstrate not only high classification accuracy (91.8% for female subjects and 90.8% for male subjects), but also good stability with respect to the number of features selected and the size of SVM kernel used. © 2006 IEEE.","Feature selection; Morphological pattern analysis; Pattern classification; Regional feature extraction; Schizophrenia; Structural MRI; Support vector machines (SVM)","Feature selection; Morphological pattern analysis; Outliers; Regional feature extraction; Schizophrenia; Support vector machines (SVM); Brain; Diagnosis; Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Pattern recognition; Tissue; Magnetic resonance imaging; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; computer program; evaluation; human; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; reproducibility; schizophrenia; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Schizophrenia; Sensitivity and Specificity; Software"

For example, in the n-queens problem, the chessboard can be rotated 90°. As a second example, several machines in a factory might have the same capacity. In a production schedule, we might therefore be able to swap the jobs on machines with the same capacity. As a third example, two people within a company might have the same skills. Given a staff roster, we might therefore be able to interchange these two people. And as a fourth example, when configuring a computer, two memory boards might be identical. We might therefore be able to swap them around without changing the performance of the computer. Symmetries come in many different forms. For instance, there are rotation symmetries (e.g. the 90° rotations of the chessboard in the n-queens problem), reflection symmetries (e.g. the reflection of the chessboard along one of its diagonals), and permutation symmetries (e.g. the interchange of equally skilled personnel in a staff roster). Problems may have many symmetries at once (e.g. the n-queens problem simultaneously has several rotation and reflection symmetries). We can describe such symmetries using group theory. The symmetries of a problem form a group. Their actions are to map solutions (a n-queens solution, a production schedule, a staff roster, a configuration, etc.) onto solutions. We must deal with such symmetry or we will waste much time visiting symmetric solutions. In addition, we must deal with symmetry during our search for solutions otherwise we will visit many search states that are symmetric to those that we have already visited. One well known mechanism to deal with symmetry is to add constraints which eliminate symmetric solutions [1]. I will describe a general method for breaking any type of symmetry [2,3]. The basic idea is very simple. We pick an ordering on the variables, and then post symmetry breaking constraints to ensure that the final solution is lexicographically less than any symmetric re-ordering of the variables. That is, we select the lex leader assignment. In theory, this solves the problem of symmetries, eliminating all symmetric solutions and pruning many symmetric states. Unfortunately, the set of symmetries might be exponentially large (for example, there are n! symmetries if we have n identical machines in a factory). By exploting properties of the set of symmetries we can sometimes overcome this problem. I will describe two special cases where we can deal with an exponential number of symmetries in polynomial time. These two cases frequently occur in practice. In the first case, we have a matrix (or array) of decisions variables in which the rows and/or columns are symmetric and can be permuted. In this case, we can lexicographical order the rows and/or columns [4,5]. In the second case, we have values for our decision variables which are symmetric and can be interchanged. I show how so called value precedence can be used to break all such symmetry [6,7]. Finally, I will end with a discussion of open research questions in this area. Are they efficient ways to combine together these symmetry breaking constraints for particular types of symmetries? Are there useful subsets of these symmetry breaking constraints when there are too many to post individually? Are there problems where the symmetry breaking constraints can be simplified? Can these symmetry breaking methods be used outside of constraint programming?. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,"Constraint programming; Decision variables; Exponential numbers; Permutation symmetry; Production schedule; Reflection symmetry; Research questions; Symmetry breaking constraints; Artificial intelligence; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Polynomial approximation; Production control; Rotation"

First, a modified scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) local descriptor is used to characterize the image features in the vicinity of each pixel, so that the deformable model deforms in a way that seeks for the region with similar SIFT local descriptors. Second, the deformable model is constrained by both population-based and patient-specified shape statistics. Initially, population-based shape statistics takes most of the rules when the number of serial images is small; gradually, patient-specific shape statistics takes more rules after a sufficient number of segmentation results on the same patient have been obtained. The proposed deformable model can adapt to the shape variability of different patients, and obtain more robust and accurate segmentation results.",,"algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biological model; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; evaluation; human; image quality; image subtraction; information retrieval; lung; methodology; radiography; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical analysis; statistical model; thorax radiography; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Lung; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Radiography, Thoracic; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique"

By considering various distortion and cutting artifacts in histological images and also fundamentally different nature of histological and MR images, our registration method is thus guided by two types of landmark points that can be reliably detected in both histological and MR images, i.e., prostate boundary points, and internal salient points that can be identified by a scale-space analysis method. The similarity between these automatically detected landmarks in histological and MR images are defined by geometric features and normalized mutual information, respectively. By optimizing a function, which integrates the similarities between landmarks with spatial constraints, the correspondences between the landmarks as well as the deformable transformation between histological and MR images can be simultaneously obtained. The performance of our proposed registration algorithm has been evaluated by various designed experiments.

When rapidly selecting a single joint action for a team, we typically solve DCOPs (often using locally optimal algorithms) to generatea single solution. However, in scenarios where a set of joint actions (i.e. a set of assignments to a DCOP) is to be generated, metrics are needed to help appropriately select this set and efficiently allocate resources for the joint actions in the set. To address this need, we introduce κ-optimality, a metric that captures the desirable properties of diversity and relative quality of a set of locally-optimal solutions using a parameter that can be tuned based on the level of these properties required. To achieve effective resource allocation for this set, we introduce several upper bounds on the cardinalities of κ-optimal joint action sets. These bounds are computable in constant time if we ignore the graph structure, but tighter, graphbased bounds are feasible with higher computation cost. Bounds help choose the appropriate level of κ-optimality for settings with fixed resources and help determine appropriate resource allocation for settings where a fixed level of κ-optimality is desired. In addition, our bounds for a 1-optimal joint action set for a DCOP also apply to the number of pure-strategy Nash equilibria in a graphical game of noncooperative agents.",,"Cardinalities; Computation costs; Constant time; Distributed constraints; Graph structures; Graph-based; Joint actions; Local interactions; Nash equilibria; Non-cooperative agents; Optimal algorithm; Optimality; Relative qualities; Solution set; Upper Bound; Artificial intelligence; Resource allocation; Optimization"

This abduction problem remains an open issue since a simple sensitivity analysis on the value of the unknown prior yields empty results.

It then surveys and comments on various existing or new solutions to this problem: the use of likelihood functions (as in classical statistics), the use of information principles like maximum entropy, Shapley value, maximum likelihood. The formal setting includes de Finetti's coherence approach, which does not exclude conditioning on contingent events with zero probability. We show that the ad hoc likelihood function method, that can be reinterpreted in terms of possibility theory, is consistent with most other formal approaches.

Studies in psychology have shown that in this case the scale of evaluation of decisions is generally bipolar. Moreover decisions are often made on the basis of an ordinal ranking of the arguments rather than on a genuine numerical evaluation of their degrees of attractiveness or rejection, hence the qualitative nature of the decision process in practice. In this paper, assuming bipolarity of evaluations and qualitative ratings, we present and axiomatically characterise two decision rules based on possibilistic order of magnitude reasoning that are capable of handling positive and negative affects. They are extensions of the maximin and maximax criteria to the bipolar case. A bipolar extension of possibility theory is thus obtained. In order to overcome the lack of discrimination power of the decision rules, refinements are also proposed, capturing both the efficiency principle and the idea of order of magnitude reasoning.

Recently, [Maheswaran et al. 2005] introduced a framework for quantitative evaluations of privacy in DCOP algorithms, showing that some DCOP algorithms lose more privacy than purely centralized approaches and questioning the motivation for applying DCOPs. This paper addresses the question of whether state-of-the art DCOP algorithms suffer from a similar shortcoming by investigating several of the most efficient DCOP algorithms, including both DPOP and ADOPT. Furthermore, while previous work investigated the impact on efficiency of distributed contraint reasoning design decisions (e.g. constraint-graph topology, asynchrony, message-contents), this paper examines the privacy aspect of such decisions, providing an improved understanding of privacy-efficiency tradeoffs.

In CE environments, which include common daily interactions, such as sealed-bid auctions and the Ultimatum Game (UG), the probability of success decreases monotonically as the expected reward increases. Thus, CE environments are characterized by an underlying conflict between the strive to maximize profits and the fear of causing the entire deal to fall through. We focus on the behavior of people who repeatedly compete in one-shot CE interactions, with a different opponent in each interaction. Our model, which is based upon the Deviated Virtual Reinforcement Learning (DVRL) algorithm, integrates the Learning Direction Theory with the Reinforcement Learning algorithm. We also examined several other models, using an innovative methodology in which the decision dynamics of the models were compared with the empirical decision patterns of individuals during their interactions. An analysis of human behavior in auctions and in the UG reveals that our model fits the decision patterns of far more subjects than any other model.

The approach involves the integration of three components: a biomechanical model of tumor mass-effect, a statistical approach to estimate the model's parameters, and a deformable image registration method. Statistical properties of the sought deformation map from the atlas to the image of a tumor patient are first obtained through tumor mass-effect simulations on normal brain images. This map is decomposed into the sum of two components in orthogonal subspaces, one representing inter-individual differences in brain shape, and the other representing tumor-induced deformation. For a new tumor case, a partial observation of the sought deformation map is obtained via deformable image registration and is decomposed into the aforementioned spaces in order to estimate the mass-effect model parameters. Using this estimate, a simulation of tumor mass-effect is performed on the atlas image in order to generate an image that is similar to tumor patient's image, thereby facilitating the atlas registration process. Results for a real tumor case and a number of simulated tumor cases indicate significant reduction in the registration error due to the presented approach as compared to the direct use of deformable image registration. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

There are two novelties in the proposed registration method. First, a set of best-scale geometric features are selected for each point in the brain, in order to facilitate correspondence detection during the registration procedure. This is achieved by optimizing an energy function that requires each point to have its best-scale geometric features consistent over the corresponding points in the training samples, and at the same time distinctive from those of nearby points in the neighborhood. Second, the active points used to drive the brain registration are hierarchically selected during the registration procedure, based on their saliency and consistency measures. That is, the image points with salient and consistent features (across different individuals) are considered for the initial registration of two images, while other less salient and consistent points join the registration procedure later. By incorporating these two novel strategies into the framework of the HAMMER registration algorithm, the registration accuracy has been improved according to the results on simulated brain data, and also visible improvement is observed particularly in the cortical regions of real brain data. © 2006 IEEE.","Best features; Best scale selection; Consistency measurement; Deformable registration; Feature-based registration; Hierarchical registration; Learning-based method; Saliency measurement","Algorithms; Brain; Computational geometry; Image analysis; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Best features; Best scale selections; Consistency measurements; Feature-based registration; Hierarchical registrations; Learning-based methods; Saliency measurements; Medical imaging; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; histology; human; image enhancement; image quality; image subtraction; information retrieval; instrumentation; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Phantoms, Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique"

Communication between robots is one mechanism that can at times be helpful in such systems, but can also create a time and energy overhead that reduces performance, In dealing with this issue, various communication schemes have been proposed ranging from centralized and localized algorithms, to non-communicative methods. In this paper we argue that using a coordination cost measure can be useful for selecting the appropriate level of communication within such groups. We show that this measure can be used to create adaptive communication methods that switch between various communication approaches, Robotic team members that implemented these approaches were able to increase their productivity in a statistically significant fashion over methods that only used one type of communication scheme.

While previous DCOP work focuses on optimizing a single team objective, in many domains, agents must satisfy additional constraints on resources consumed locally (due to interactions within their local neighborhoods). Such local resource constraints may be required to be private or shared for efficiency's sake. This paper provides a novel multiply-constrained DCOP algorithm for addressing these domains. This algorithm is based on mutually-intervening search, i.e. using local resource constraints to intervene in the search for the optimal solution and vice versa, realized via three key ideas: (i) transforming n-ary constraints via virtual variables to maintain privacy; (ii) dynamically setting upper bounds on joint resource consumption with neighbors; and (iii) identifying if the local DCOP graph structure allows agents to compute exact resource bounds for additional efficiency. These ideas are implemented by modifying Adopt, one of the most efficient DCOP algorithms. Both detailed experimental results as well as proofs of correctness are presented.

To apply finite-domain constraint programming to a problem, it is modelled by a set of constraints on a set of decision variables. A common modelling pattern is the use of matrices of decision variables. The rows and/or columns of these matrices are often symmetric, leading to redundancy in a systematic search for solutions. An effective method of breaking this symmetry is to constrain the assignments of the affected rows and columns to be ordered lexicographically. This paper develops an incremental propagation algorithm, GACLexLeq, that establishes generalised arc consistency on this constraint in O ( n ) operations, where n is the length of the vectors. Furthermore, this paper shows that decomposing GACLexLeq into primitive constraints available in current finite-domain constraint toolkits reduces the strength or increases the cost of constraint propagation. Also presented are extensions and modifications to the algorithm to handle strict lexicographic ordering, detection of entailment, and vectors of unequal length. Experimental results on a number of domains demonstrate the value of GACLexLeq. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

For on-line prediction, validated stressor vectors may be obtained by direct measurements or sensors, which after pre-processing and standardization are fed into the GP models.

A set of Gabor-support vector machines (G-SVMs) are positioned on different patches of the model surface, and trained to adaptively capture texture priors of ultrasound images for differentiation of prostate and nonprostate tissues in different zones around prostate boundary. Each G-SVM consists of a Gabor filter bank for extraction of rotation-invariant texture features and a kernel support vector machine for robust differentiation of textures. In the deformable segmentation procedure, these pretrained G-SVMs are used to tentatively label voxels around the surface of deformable model as prostate or nonprostate tissues by a statistical texture matching. Subsequently, the surface of deformable model is driven to the boundary between the tentatively labeled prostate and nonprostate tissues. Since the step of tissue labeling and the step of label-based surface deformation are dependent on each other, these two steps are repeated until they converge.

However, to engage in such argumentative encounters the agents require the ability to generate arguments, which, in turn, demands four fundamental capabilities: a schema to reason in a social context, a mechanism to identify a suitable set of arguments, a language and a protocol to exchange these arguments, and a decision making functionality to generate such dialogues. This paper focuses on the first two issues and formulates models to capture them. Specifically, we propose a coherent schema, based on social commitments, to capture social influences emanating from the roles and relationships of a multi-agent society. After explaining how agents can use this schema to reason within a society, we then use it to identify two major ways of exploiting social influence within ABN to resolve conflicts. The first of these allows agents to argue about the validity of each other's social reasoning, whereas the second enables agents to exploit social influences by incorporating them as parameters within their negotiation. For each of these, we use our schema to systematically capture a comprehensive set of social arguments that can be used within a multi-agent society. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.","Argumentation-based Negotiation; Conflict Resolution","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computer software; Decision making; Information technology; Network protocols; Argumentation-based Negotiation; Argumentative encounter; Conflict Resolution; Social influence; Multi agent systems"

Indeed, privacy is recognized as a key motivating factor in design of several multiagent algorithms, such as distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) algorithms. Unfortunately, rigorous and general quantitative metrics for analysis and comparison of such multiagent algorithms with respect to privacy loss are lacking. This paper takes a key step towards developing a general quantitative model from which one can analyze and generate metrics of privacy loss by introducing the VPS (Valuations of Possible States) framework. VPS is shown to capture various existing measures of privacy created for specific domains of distributed constraint satisfactions problems (DCSPs). The utility of VPS is further illustrated via analysis of DCOP algorithms, when such algorithms are used by personal assistant agents to schedule meetings among users. In addition, VPS allows us to quantitatively evaluate the properties of several privacy metrics generated through qualitative notions. We obtain the unexpected result that decentralization does not automatically guarantee superior protection of privacy.

DEFACTO is based on a software proxy architecture and 3D visualization system, which addresses the two limitations described above. First, the 3D visualization interface enables human virtual omnipresence in the environment, improving human situational awareness and ability to assist agents.

In such environments, distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) has emerged as a key technology for multiple collaborative assistants to coordinate with each other. Unfortunately, while previous work in DCOP only focuses on coordination in service of optimizing a single global team objective, personal assistants often require satisfying additional individual user-specified criteria. This paper provides a novel DCOP algorithm that enables personal assistants to engage in such multicriteria coordination while maintaining the privacy of their additional criteria. It uses n-ary NOGOODS implemented as private variables to achieve this. In addition, we've developed an algorithm that reveals only the individual criteria of a link and can speed up performance for certain problem structures. The key idea in this algorithm is that interleaving the criteria searches - rather than sequentially attempting to satisfy the criteria - improves efficiency by mutually constraining the distributed search for solutions. These ideas are realized in the form of private-g and public-g Multi-criteria ADOPT, built on top of ADOPT, one of the most efficient DCOP algorithms.

We can therefore often find much of the backbone using approximation methods based on good heuristics. We demonstrate that such backbone information can be used to guide the search for an optimal solution. However, the variance in runtimes when using a backbone guided heuristic is large. This suggests that we may need to combine such heuristics with randomization and restarts. In addition, though backbone guided heuristics are useful for finding optimal solutions, they are less help in proving optimality.",,"Approximation methods; Optimal solutions; Optimality; Optimization problems; Performance guarantees; Runtimes; Artificial intelligence; Optimization; Optimal systems"

The challenge is particularly difficult given the significant observational uncertainty, and uncertainty in the outcome of agent's actions. POMDPs (partially observable markov decision problems) appear well-suited to enable agents to address such uncertainties and costs; yet slow run-times in generating optimal POMDP policies presents a significant hurdle. This slowness can be attributed to cautious planning for all possible belief states, e.g., the uncertainty in the monitored process is assumed to range over all possible states at all times. This paper introduces three key techniques to speedup POMDP policy generation that exploit the notion of progress or dynamics in personal assistant domains. The key insight is that given an initial (possibly uncertain) starting set of states, the agent needs to be prepared to act only in a limited range of belief states; most other belief states are simply unreachable given the dynamics of the monitored process, and no policy needs to be generated for such belief states. The techniques we propose are complementary to most existing exact and approximate POMDP policy generation algorithms. Indeed, we illustrate our technique by enhancing generalized incremental pruning (GIP), one of the most efficient exact algorithms for POMDP policy generation and illustrate orders of magnitude speedup in policy generation. Such speedup would facilitate agents' deploying POMDPs in assisting human users.",,"Generalized incremental pruning (GIP); Monitoring state; Partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDP); Decision theory; Markov processes; Multi agent systems; Artificial intelligence"

As a result, the agent's goal is to acquire enough units of information in order to make a decision while incurring minimal cost. We focus on situations where the agent must decide in advance how many units it would like to obtain.

The interaction between the team members and the cost associated with this interaction are represented by a weighted graph. Consider a group of N robots organized in a formation, the graph is the monitoring graph which represents the sensorial capabilities of the robots, i.e., which robot can sense the other and al what cost. Following this example, the team member reallocation problem this paper deals with is the extraction of k robots from the group in order to acquire a new target, while minimizing the cost of the interaction of the remaining group. In general, the method proposed here shifts the utility from the team member itself to the interaction between the members, and calculates the reallocation according to this interaction utility.

The representative agents operate in environments where numerous potential complex opportunities can be found. Each opportunity is associated with several different terms and conditions thus differing from other opportunities by its value for the coalition. Given a search cost, the goal of the representative agent is to find the best set of opportunities which fulfills the coalition's demands with the maximum overall utility, to be divided among the coalition members. Given the option of side-payments, this strategy will always be preferred by all coalition members (thus no conflict of interests), regardless of the coalition's payoff division protocol. We analyze the incentive to form such coalitions and extract the optimal search strategy for their representative agents, with a distinction between operating in B2C and C2C markets. Based on our findings we suggest efficient algorithms to be used by the representative agents for calculating a strategy that maximizes their expected utilities.

Now, since the number of possible coalitions increases exponentially with the number of agents involved, having one agent calculate all the values is inefficient. Given this, we present a novel algorithm for distributing this calculation among agents in cooperative environments. Specifically, by using our algorithm, each agent is assigned some part of the calculation such that the agents' shares are exhaustive and disjoint. Moreover, the algorithm is decentralized, requires no communication between the agents, and has minimal memory requirements. To evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm we compare it with the only other algorithm available in the literature (due to Shehory and Kraus). This shows that for the case of 25 agents, the distribution process of our algorithm took 0.00037% of the time, the values were calculated using 0.000006% of the memory, the calculation redundancy was reduced from 477826101 to 0, and the total number of bytes sent between the agents dropped from 674047872 to 0 (note that for larger numbers of agents, these improvements become exponentially better).

The allocator in our model is responsible for the performance of dynamically arriving tasks using a second price reverse auction as the allocation protocol. Since the agents are self-interested (i.e. each agent attempts to maximize its own revenue), previous models concerning cooperative agents aiming for a joint goal are not applicable. Thus the main challenge is to identify a set of equilibrium strategies - a stable solution where no agent can benefit from changing its strategy given the other agents' strategies - for any specific environmental settings. We formulate the model and discuss the difficulty in extracting the agents' equilibrium strategies directly from the model's equations. Consequently we propose an efficient algorithm to accurately approximate the agents' equilibrium strategies. A comparative illustration through simulation of the system performance in a closed and open environments is given, emphasizing the advantage of the allocator operating in the latter environment, reaching results close to those obtained by a central enforceable allocation.

In 22 participants performing a forced-choice deception task, 99% of the true and false responses were discriminated correctly. Predictive accuracy, assessed by cross-validation in participants not included in training, was 88%.

Game theoretic models for bargaining assume that players are perfectly rational and that this rationality is common knowledge. However the perfect rationality assumption does not hold for real-life bargaining scenarios with humans as players since results from experimental economics show that humans find their way to the best strategy through trial and error and not typically by means of rational deliberation. Such players are said to be boundedly rational. In playing a game against an opponent with bounded rationality the most effective strategy of a player is not the equilibrium strategy but the one that is the best reply to the opponent's strategy. The evolutionary model provides a means for studying the bargaining behaviour of boundedly rational players. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison of the game theoretic and evolutionary approaches to bargaining by examining their assumptions goals and limitations.

Based on previous work on scale-space decomposition of deformation fields, herein we represent the space of ""valid deformations"" as the intersection of three subspaces: one that satisfies constraints on deformations themselves, one that satisfies constraints on Jacobian determinants of deformations, and one that represents smooth deformations via a Markov Random Field (MRF). The first two are extensions of PCA-based statistical shape models. They are based on a wavelet packet basis decomposition that allows for more accurate estimation of the covariance structure of deformation or Jacobian fields, and they are used jointly due to their complementary strengths and limitations. The third is a nested MRF regularization aiming at eliminating potential discontinuities introduced by assumptions in the statistical models. A randomly sampled deformation field is projected onto the space of valid deformations via iterative projections on each of these subspaces until convergence, i.e. all three constraints are met.

This paper bridges the gap between probabilistic and logical representations of accepted beliefs. To this end, natural properties of relations on propositions, describing relative strength of belief are augmented with some conditions ensuring that accepted beliefs form a deductively closed set. This requirement turns out to be very restrictive. In particular, it is shown that the sets of accepted belief of an agent can always be derived from a family of possibility rankings of states. An agent accepts a proposition in a given context if this proposition is considered more possible than its negation in this context, for all possibility rankings in the family. These results are closely connected to the non-monotonic 'preferential' inference system of Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor and the so-called plausibility functions of Friedman and Halpern. The extent to which probability theory is compatible with acceptance relations is laid bare. A solution to the lottery paradox, which is considered as a major impediment to the use of non-monotonic inference is proposed using a special kind of probabilities (called lexicographic, or big-stepped). The setting of acceptance relations also proposes another way of approaching the theory of belief change after the works of Gärdenfors and colleagues. Our view considers the acceptance relation as a primitive object from which belief sets are derived in various contexts. © 2004 AI Access Foundation.

Standard possibilistic logic expressions are classical logic formulas associated with weights, interpreted in the framework of possibility theory as lower bounds of necessity degrees. Possibilistic logic handles partial inconsistency since an inconsistency level can be computed for each possibilistic logic base. Logical formulas with a weight strictly greater than this level are immune to inconsistency and can be safely used in deductive reasoning. This paper first recalls the basic features of possibilistic logic, including information fusion operations. Then, several extensions that mainly deal with the nature and the handling of the weights attached to formulas, are suggested or surveyed: The leximin-based comparison of proofs, the use of partially ordered scales for the weights, or the management of fuzzily restricted variables. Inference principles that are more powerful than the basic possibilistic inference in case of inconsistency are also briefly considered. The interest of a companion logic, based on the notion of guaranteed possibility functions, and working in a way opposite to the one of usual logic, is also emphasized. Its joint use with standard possibilistic logic is briefly discussed.

Population differences with complex spatial patterns are then determined by applying a nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) pattern classification method to the morphological signatures. Significant reduction of the dimensionality of the morphological signatures is achieved via wavelet decomposition and feature reduction methods. Applying the method to MR images with simulated atrophy shows that the method can correctly detect subtle and spatially complex atrophy, even when the simulated atrophy represents only a 5% variation from the original image. Applying this method to actual MR images shows that brains can be correctly determined to be male or female with a successful classification rate of 97%, using the leave-one-out method. This proposed method also shows a high classification rate for old adults' age classification, even under difficult test scenarios. The main characteristic of the proposed methodology is that, by applying multivariate pattern classification methods, it can detect subtle and spatially complex patterns of morphological group differences which are often not detectable by voxel-based morphometric methods, because these methods analyze morphological measurements voxel-by-voxel and do not consider the entirety of the data simultaneously. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Many robotic groups operate within domains where restrictions such as limiting areas of operation are liable to cause spatial conflicts between robots. Our previous work proposed a measure of coordination, interference, that measured the total time robots dealt with resolving such conflicts. We found that a robotic group's productivity was negatively correlated with interference: Effective coordination techniques minimized interference and thus achieved higher productivity. This paper uses this result to create adaptive coordination techniques that are able to dynamically adjust the efforts spent on coordination to match the number of perceived coordination conflicts in a group. Our robots independently calculate a projected level of interference they will encounter. By using this metric as a guide, we are able to create adaptive coordination methods that can quickly and effectively adjust to changing conditions within their environment. We present an adaptation heuristic that is completely distributed and requires no communication between robots. Using thousands of simulated trials, we found that groups using this approach achieved a statistically significant improvement in productivity over non-Adaptive coordination methods.",,"Artificial intelligence; Deep neural networks; Intelligent systems; Productivity; Robotics; Robots; Adaptive coordination; Coordination mechanisms; Coordination technique; Key Issues; Limiting areas; Robot coordination; Spatial conflicts; Human resource management"

Existing methods for DCOP are not able to provide theoretical guarantees on global solution quality while operating both efficiently and asynchronously. Adopt is guaranteed to find an optimal solution, or a solution within a user-specified distance from the optimal, while allowing agents to execute asynchronously and in parallel. Adopt obtains these properties via a distributed search algorithm with several novel characteristics including the ability for each agent to make local decisions based on currently available information and without necessarily having global certainty. Theoretical analysis shows that Adopt provides provable quality guarantees, while experimental results show that Adopt is significantly more efficient than synchronous methods. The speedups are shown to be partly due to the novel search strategy employed and partly due to the asynchrony of the algorithm.","Constraint Satisfaction/Optimization; Multi-agent Coordination","Algorithms; Communication; Computer simulation; Costs; Decision making; Optimization; Polynomials; Problem solving; Constraint satisfaction; Multi-agent coordination; Artificial intelligence"

To this end, we show that a marketplace, in which the various recommendation methods compete to offer their recommendations to the user, can be used in this role.

While performance models of such coordination or conflict resolution strategies could aid in selecting the right strategy for a given domain, such models remain largely uninvestigated in the multiagent literature. This paper takes a step towards applying the recently emerging distributed POMDP (partially observable Markov decision process) frameworks, such as MTDP (Markov team decision process), in service of creating such performance models. To address issues of scale-up, we use small-scale models, called building blocks that represent the local interaction among a small group of agents. We discuss several ways to combine building blocks for performance prediction of a larger-scale multiagent system. We present our approach in the context of DCSPs (distributed constraint satisfaction problems), where we first show that there is a large bank of conflict resolution strategies and no strategy dominates all others across different domains. By modeling and combining building blocks, we are able to predict the performance of five different DCSP strategies for four different domain settings, for a large-scale multiagent system. Our approach thus points the way to new tools for strategy analysis and performance modeling in multiagent systems in general.","Performance Measurement","Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation; Large scale systems; Markov processes; Mathematical models; Performance; Sensors; Set theory; Building blocks; Markov decision process; Multi agent systems"

What remain missing are analysis techniques to aid human developers in quantitatively comparing different initial role allocations and competing role reallocation algorithms. To remedy this problem, this paper makes three key contributions. First, the paper introduces RMTDP (Role-based Multiagent Team Decision Problem), an extension to MTDP [9], for quantitative evaluations of role allocation and reallocation approaches. Second, the paper illustrates an RMTDP-based methodology for not only comparing two competing algorithms for role reallocation, but also for identifying the types of domains where each algorithm is suboptimal, how much each algorithm can be improved and at what computational cost (complexity). Such algorithmic improvements are identified via a new automated procedure that generates a family of locally optimal policies for comparative evaluations. Third, since there are combinatorially many initial role allocations, evaluating each in RMTDP to identify the best is extremely difficult. Therefore, we introduce methods to exploit task decompositions among subteams to significantly prune the search space of initial role allocations. We present experimental results from two distinct domains.","Analysis of Teams; Reallocation; Role allocation","Analysis of teams; Reallocation; Role allocation; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Decision theory; Markov processes; Probability; Resource allocation; Uncertain systems; Multi agent systems"

To date, much of the research in the area has concentrated on the problem of service discovery. However, once a service has been discovered, it needs to be provisioned according to the goals and constraints of the service provider and the service consumer. Since, in general, these will be different stakeholders (with different aims), the de facto provisioning method will be some form of negotiation. To this end, this paper develops automated negotiation protocols and strategies that are applicable in m-commerce environments. Specifically, we develop and evaluate time-constrained bilateral negotiation algorithms, that allow software agents to adapt to the quality of the network and/or their experience of similar interactions.","Agents; Automated negotiation; M-services","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Electronic commerce; Formal languages; Internet; Multimedia systems; Network protocols; Quality of service; Software agents; Telecommunication services; Tracking (position); Wireless telecommunication systems; Automated negotiation; Context awareness; Location sensitive services; Mobile telecommunication systems"

Since the pioneering work of Savage, most models of decision under uncertainty rely on a numerical representation where utility and uncertainty are commensurate. Giving up this tradition, we relax this assumption and introduce an axiom of ordinal invariance requiring that the Decision Maker's preference between two acts only depends on the relative position of their consequences for each state. Within this qualitative framework, we determine the only possible form of the corresponding decision rule. Then assuming the transitivity of the strict preference, the underlying partial confidence relations are those at work in non-monotonic inference and thus satisfy one of the main properties of possibility theory. The satisfaction of additional postulates of unanimity and anonymity enforces the use of a necessity measure, unique up to a monotonic transformation, for encoding the relative likelihood of events. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we are concerned with the principled negotiation approach in which agents seek to strike a fair deal for both parties, but which, nevertheless, maximises their own payoff. Thus, there are elements of both competition and cooperation in the negotiation (hence semi-competitive environments). One of the key intuitions of the approach is that there is often more than one option that can satisfy the interests of both parties. So, if the opponent cannot accept an offer then the proponent should endeavour to find an alternative that is equally acceptable to it, but more acceptable to the opponent. That is, the agent should make a trade-off. Only if such a trade-off is not possible should the agent make a concession. Against this background, our model ensures the agents reach a deal that is fair (Pareto-optimal) for both parties if such a solution exists. Moreover, this is achieved by minimising the amount of private information that is revealed. The model uses prioritised fuzzy constraints to represent trade-offs between the different possible values of the negotiation issues and to indicate how concessions should be made when they are necessary. Also by using constraints to express negotiation proposals, the model can cover the negotiation space more efficiently since each exchange covers a region rather than a single point (which is what most existing models deal with). In addition, by incorporating the notion of a reward into our negotiation model, the agents can sometimes reach agreements that would not otherwise be possible. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Possibility theory lies at the crossroads between fuzzy sets, probability and nonmonotonic reasoning. Possibility theory can be cast either in an ordinal or in a numerical setting. Qualitative possibility theory is closely related to belief revision theory, and commonsense reasoning with exception-tainted knowledge in Artificial Intelligence. It has been axiomatically justified in a decision-theoretic framework in the style of Savage, thus providing a foundation for qualitative decision theory. Quantitative possibility theory is the simplest framework for statistical reasoning with imprecise probabilities. As such it has close connections with random set theory and confidence intervals, and can provide a tool for uncertainty propagation with limited statistical or subjective information.",,"Artificial intelligence; Decision theory; Fuzzy sets; Probability; Statistical methods; Possibility theory; Uncertain systems"

First, we synthesize and clarify the key abstractions of agent-based computing as they pertain to agent-oriented software engineering. In particular, we argue that a multiagent system can naturally be viewed and architected as a computational organization, and we identify the appropriate organizational abstractions that are central to the analysis and design of such systems. Second, we detail and extend the Gaia methodology for the analysis and design of multiagent systems. Gaia exploits the aforementioned organizational abstractions to provide clear guidelines for the analysis and design of complex and open software systems. Two representative case studies are introduced to exemplify Gaia's concepts and to show its use and effectiveness in different types of multiagent system.","Agent-oriented software engineering; Analysis and design methodologies; Distributed systems; Multiagent systems; Software architectures","Agent-oriented software engineering; Analysis and design methodologies; Software architecture; Artificial intelligence; Computer aided design; Computer architecture; Distributed computer systems; Open systems; Software engineering; Multi agent systems"

Building a collaborative agent that can flexibly achieve its goals in changing environments requires a blending of real-time computing and AI technologies. Therefore, our mechanism consists of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning subsystem and a Real-Time (RT) scheduling subsystem. The AI planning subsystem is based on a model for collaborative planning. The AI planning subsystem generates a partial order plan dynamically. During the planning it sends the RT scheduling subsystem basic actions and time constraints. The RT scheduling subsystem receives the dynamic basic actions set with associated temporal constraints and inserts these actions into the agent's schedule of activities in such a way that the resulting schedule is feasible and satisfies the temporal constraints. Our mechanism allows the agent to construct its individual schedule independently. The mechanism handles various types of temporal constraints arising from individual activities and its collaborators. In contrast to other works on scheduling in planning systems which are either not appropriate for uncertain and dynamic environments or cannot be expanded for use in multi-agent systems, our mechanism enables the individual agent to determine the time of its activities in uncertain situations and to easily integrate its activities with the activities of other agents. We have proved that under certain conditions temporal reasoning mechanism of the AI planning sub-system is sound and complete. We show the results of several experiments on the system.

Over the past twenty-five years, the way the market has performed those tasks has changed enormously. The need for intelligent monitoring systems has become a necessity to keep track of the complex forex market. The vast currency market is a foreign concept to the average individual. However, once it is broken down into simple terms, the average individual can begin to understand the foreign exchange market and use it as a financial instrument for future investing. In this paper, we attempt to compare the performance of hybrid soft computing and hard computing techniques to predict the average monthly forex rates one month ahead. The soft computing models considered are a neural network trained by the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm and a neuro-fuzzy model implementing a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system. We also considered Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and a hybrid CART-MARS technique. We considered the exchange rates of Australian dollar with respect to US dollar, Singapore dollar, New Zealand dollar, Japanese yen and United Kingdom pounds. The models were trained using 70% of the data and remaining was used for testing and validation purposes. It is observed that the proposed hybrid models could predict the forex rates more accurately than all the techniques when applied individually. Empirical results also reveal that the hybrid hard computing approach also improved some of our previous work using a neuro-fuzzy approach.",,"Foreign currency exchange; Forex monitoring systems; Hard computing; Soft computing; Algorithms; Commerce; Economics; Finance; Fuzzy sets; Inference engines; Mathematical models; Monitoring; Neural networks; Artificial intelligence"

However, this is not always the case, and understanding why remains a very interesting open question. We identify phase transition behavior in each of these problem classes.

A typical situation is an exchange involving goods and money in a person-to-person trade in an Internet auction. Although the Internet and agent technologies have facilitated world-wide trade, we sometimes encounter risky situations, such as fraud, in the process of exchanges involving goods and money. This problem is becoming more serious with the growing popularity of person-to-person trade. One of the reasons why fraud is becoming widespread is that obtaining a new identifier in a network is cheap. This makes it almost impossible to exclude malicious agents from trade. One solution is to impose an entry fee. However, if the entry fee is too high, it will discourage newcomers from starting deals. To resolve the conflict between safety and convenience, we developed three exchange mechanisms that can guarantee against defection from a contract. Two of them reduce the entry fee by integrating multiple deals and controlling the flow of goods and money. The other reduces the entry fee by incorporating a third-party agent into the exchange process. We examine the lower bound of the entry fee for both of these mechanisms and describe a calculation method by which this value can be obtained in linear time. Our results show that the described mechanism can effectively reduce the lower bound of the entry fee. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We perform a detailed formal comparison of these two transformations. Our comparison focuses on two backtracking algorithms that maintain a local consistency property at each node in their search tree: The forward checking and maintaining arc consistency algorithms. We first compare local consistency techniques such as arc consistency in terms of their inferential power when they are applied to the original (non-binary) formulation and to each of its binary transformations. For example, we prove that enforcing arc consistency on the original formulation is equivalent to enforcing it on the hidden transformation. We then extend these results to the two backtracking algorithms. We are able to give either a theoretical bound on how much one formulation is better than another, or examples that show such a bound does not exist. For example, we prove that the performance of the forward checking algorithm applied to the hidden transformation of a problem is within a polynomial bound of the performance of the same algorithm applied to the dual transformation of the problem. Our results can be used to help decide if applying one of these transformations to all (or part) of a constraint satisfaction model would be beneficial. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Contrary to classical approaches to decision theory, we try to rank acts without resorting to any numerical representation of utility or uncertainty, and without using any scale on which both uncertainty and preference could be mapped. Our approach is a variant of Savage's where the setting is finite, and the strict preference on acts is a partial order. It is shown that although many axioms of Savage theory are preserved and despite the intuitive appeal of the ordinal method for constructing a preference over acts, the approach is inconsistent with a probabilistic representation of uncertainty. The latter leads to the kind of paradoxes encountered in the theory of voting. It is shown that the assumption of ordinal invariance enforces a qualitative decision procedure that presupposes a comparative possibility representation of uncertainty, originally due to Lewis, and usual in nonmonotonic reasoning. Our axiomatic investigation thus provides decision-theoretic foundations to the preferential inference of Lehmann and colleagues. However, the obtained decision rules are sometimes either not very decisive or may lead to overconfident decisions, although their basic principles look sound. This paper points out some limitations of purely ordinal approaches to Savage-like decision making under uncertainty, in perfect analogy with similar difficulties in voting theory.","Comparative uncertainty; Decision theory; Nonmonotonic reasoning; Possibility theory; Preference relations; Qualitative decision theory","Artificial intelligence; Autonomous agents; Condition monitoring; Decision making; Information retrieval; Information science; Investment casting; Mapping; Numerical analysis; Probability; Relational database systems; Nonmonotonic reasoning; Possibility theory; Qualitative decision theory; Decision theory"

Such domains include auctions on task allocation, services, or compound items. The buyer announces a scoring rule, according to its preferences, before the auction starts, and each seller places a bid, which describes the attributes of the item it offers for sale. First, we consider a variation of the first-price sealed-bid protocol, and we provide optimal and stable strategies for the buyer agent and for the seller agents participating in the multi-attribute auction. In addition, we analyze the buyer's expected revenue and suggest an optimal scoring rule that can be announced. Second, we consider four variations of the English auction for the case of a multi-attribute item, and we prove that, given some assumptions, they all converge to the same result. We also discuss which variation is preferred for different types of environments. Moreover, we show under which conditions, announcing the truth about buyer preferences is the optimal strategy for the buyer.","Bidding and bargaining agents; Electronic commerce market","Artificial intelligence; Electronic commerce; Intelligent agents; Multi agent systems; Multi-attribute auctions; Network protocols"

This hypothesis is evaluated empirically, using reinforcement based algorithms, in a grid-world scenario in which a) an agent's prediction about the other agents in the environment is approximately correct and b) an agent can not correctly predict the others' behaviour.

Determining whether and when such transfer of control must occur is arguably the fundamental research question in adjustable autonomy. Practical systems have made significant in-roads in answering this question and in providing high-level guidelines for transfer of control decisions. For instance, report that Markov decision processes were successfully used in transfer of control decisions in a real-world multiagent system, but that use of C4.5 led to failures. Yet, an underlying theory of transfer of control, that would explain such successes or failures is missing. To take a step in building this theory, we introduce the notion of a transfer-of-control strategy, which potentially involves several transfer of control actions. A mathematical model based on this notion allows both analysis of previously reported implementations and guidance for the design of new implementations. The practical benefits of this model are illustrated in a dramatic simplification of an existing adjustable autonomy system.",,"Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Markov processes; Mathematical models; Multi agent systems; Adjustable autonomy (AA); Intelligent agents"

On the other hand, Barabási and Albert's power law model, gives graphs with both nodes of high degree and a small world topology. These graphs may therefore be useful for benchmarking. We then measure the impact of nodes of high degree and a small world topology on the cost of coloring graphs. The long tail in search costs observed with small world graphs disappears when these graphs are also constructed to contain nodes of high degree.

The recurring question is that of the mathematical and pragmatic meaningfulness of a compositional calculus and the validity of the excluded middle law. This confusion pervades the early developments of probabilistic logic, despite early warnings of some philosophers of probability. This paper tries to clarify this situation. It emphasizes three main points. First, it suggests that the root of the controversies lies in the unfortunate confusion between degrees of belief and what logicians call ""degrees of truth"". The latter are usually compositional, while the former cannot be so. This claim is first illustrated by laying bare the non-compositional belief representation embedded in the standard propositional calculus. It turns out to be an all-or-nothing version of possibility theory. This framework is then extended to discuss the case of fuzzy logic versus graded possibility theory. Next, it is demonstrated that any belief representation where compositionality is taken for granted is bound to at worst collapse to a Boolean truth assignment and at best to a poorly expressive tool. Lastly, some claims pertaining to an alleged compositionality of possibility theory are refuted, thus clarifying a pervasive confusion between possibility theory axioms and fuzzy set basic connectives.",,

The proposed model generalizes both a previously developed approach to binary symptoms on the one hand, and a treatment of graded symptoms in the case of precise observations also recently introduced on the other hand.","Diagnosis; Possibility theory; Uncertainty","Artificial intelligence; Boolean algebra; Diagnosis; Fuzzy sets; Probabilistic logics; Single-fault causal diagnosis; Pattern matching"

The information possessed by an agent is supposed to be made of three items: sure observations, generic knowledge and inferred contingent beliefs. The main notion supporting this approach is the confidence relation, a partial ordering of events which encodes the generic knowledge of an agent. Plausible inference is achieved by conditioning. The paper advocates the similarity between plausible reasoning with confidence relations and probabilistic reasoning. The main difference is that the ordinal approach supports the notion of accepted beliefs forming a deductively closed set, while probability theory is not tailored for it. The framework of confidence relations sheds light on the connections between some approaches to non-monotonic reasoning methods, possibilistic logic and the theory of belief revision. In particular the distinction between revising contingent beliefs in the light of observations and revising the confidence relation is laid bare. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.",,"Artificial intelligence; Belief revision; Incomplete information; Non-monotonic reasoning; Position papers; Possibilistic logic; Probabilistic reasoning; Probability theory; Uncertainty modeling; Uncertainty analysis"

Negotiations which take into account a multi-step exchange of arguments provide extra information, at each step, for the intervening agents, enabling them to react accordingly. This argument-based negotiation among agents has much to gain from the use of logical mechanisms. Although the use of logic to express arguments in Law is well known, EC poses new challenges. Concepts such as round and probable conflict are important in the formalization of negotiation arguments. The ideas of conflict/attack and victory/defeat are some of the most important to be formalized. Incomplete information is common in EC scenarios therefore, arguments must take into account the presence of statements with an unknown valuation. The set of rules that is to express the knowledge of an agent needs priorization; i.e., some rules have a higher priority than others. Priorities are usually set by the relative ordering of clauses, however, through knowledge classification and the introduction of embedded priority rules, an higher flexibility is reached. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.","Agents; Argument-based negotiation; Formal specification; Logic","Agents; Artificial intelligence; Computers; Formal specification; Argument-based negotiation; Formal analysis; Incomplete information; Knowledge classification; Logic; Priority rules; Priorization; Relative order; Intelligent agents"

This paper considers how automated agents could use focal points for coordination in communication-impoverished situations. Coordination is a central theme of Distributed Artificial Intelligence. Much work in this field can be seen as a search for mechanisms that allow agents with differing knowledge and goals to coordinate their actions for mutual benefit. Additionally, one of the main assumptions of the field is that communication is expensive relative to computation. Thus, coordination techniques that minimize communication are of particular importance. Our purpose in this paper is to consider how to model the process of finding focal points from domain-independent criteria, under the assumption that agents cannot communicate with one another. We consider two alternative approaches for finding focal points, one based on decision theory, the second on step-logic. The first provides for a more natural integration of agent utilities, while the second more successfully models the difficulty of finding solutions. For both cases, we present simulations over randomly generated domains that suggest that focal points can act as an effective heuristic for coordination.",,

Tools that can help humans analyze, evaluate, and understand team behaviors are becoming increasingly important as well. We have taken a step towards building such a tool by creating an automated analyst agent called ISAAC for post-hoc, off-line agent-team analysis. ISAAC's novelty stems from a key design constraint that arises in team analysis: multiple types of models of team behavior are necessary to analyze different granularities of team events, including agent actions, interactions, and global performance. These heterogeneous team models are automatically acquired via machine learning over teams' external behavior traces, where the specific learning techniques are tailored to the particular model learned. Additionally, ISAAC employs multiple presentation techniques that can aid human understanding of the analyses. This paper presents ISAAC's general conceptual framework, motivating its design, as well as its concrete application in the domain of RoboCup soccer. In the RoboCup domain, ISAAC was used prior to and during the RoboCup'99 tournament, and was awarded the RoboCup scientific challenge award. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.",,"Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Multi agent systems; Sports; Virtual corporation; Collective robotics; Conceptual frameworks; Concrete applications; Design constraints; Different granularities; Global performance; Human understanding; Multi-agent teamwork; Intelligent agents"

Yet, to date, there has been little systematic analysis of what makes an agent such an appealing and powerful conceptual model. Moreover, even less effort has been devoted to exploring the inherent disadvantages that stem from adopting an agent-oriented view. Here both sets of issues are explored. The standpoint of this analysis is the role of agent-based software in solving complex, real-world problems. In particular, it will be argued that the development of robust and scalable software systems requires autonomous agents that can complete their objectives while situated in a dynamic and uncertain environment, that can engage in rich, high-level social interactions, and that can operate within flexible organisational structures.",,"Agent-based computing; Agent-based softwares; Organisational structure; Practice of modelling; Real-world problem; Social interactions; Systematic analysis; Uncertain environments; Autonomous agents; Artificial intelligence"

This article presents CONSA, a system we are developing to resolve conflicts using argumentation-based negotiations. CONSA focuses on exploiting the benefits of argumentation in a team setting. Thus, CONSA casts conflict resolution as a team problem, so that the recent advances in teamwork can be brought to bear during conflict resolution to improve argumentation flexibility. Furthermore, because teamwork conflicts sometimes involve past teamwork, teamwork models can be exploited to provide agents with reusable argumentation knowledge. Additionally, CONSA also includes argumentation strategies geared toward benefiting the team, rather than the individual, and techniques to reduce argumentation overhead.

Collaboration enables them to work more efficiently and to complete activities they could not accomplish individually. An increasing number of computer applications also require collaboration among various systems and people. Thus, a major challenge for AI researchers is to determine how to construct computer systems that are able to act effectively as partners in collaborative activity. Collaborative activity entails participants forming commitments to achieve the goals of the group activity and requires group decision making and group planning procedures. In addition, agents must be committed to supporting the activities of their fellow participants in support of the group activity. Furthermore, when conflicts arise (for example, from resource bounds), participants must weigh their commitments to various group activities against those for individual activities. This article briefly reviews the major features of one model of collaborative planning called SHARED-PLANS. It describes several current efforts to develop collaborative planning agents and systems for human-computer communication based on this model.

These different expression modes can be handled in a weighted logical setting, here the one of possibilistic logic. The aggregation of preferences pertaining to different criteria can then be handled by fusing sets of prioritized goals.

Our experiments show the practical value of achieving these high levels of consistency.

It is not only made as an annotated bibliography of past works. It also emphasizes simple basic ideas that govern most of the existing methods, especially the principle of minimum specificity and the combination/projection principle that facilitate a comparison between fuzzy set-based methods and other numerical approaches to automated reasoning. Also, a significant part of the text is devoted to the representation of truth-qualified, certainty-qualified and possibility-qualified fuzzy statements. A new attempt to classify the numerous models of fuzzy ""if . . . then"" rules from a semantic point of view is presented. In the past, people have classified them according to algebraic properties of the underlying implication, or by putting constraints on the expected behavior of the inference process (by analogy with classical logic), or by running extensive comparative trials of particular implications on test-examples. Here the classification is based on whether the rules qualify the truth, the certainty or the possibility of their conclusions. Each case corresponds to a specific way of deriving the underlying conditional possibility distribution. This paper focuses on semantic approaches to approximate reasoning based on fuzzy sets, commonly exemplified by the generalized modus ponens, but also considers applications to current topics in Artificial Intelligence such as default reasoning and qualitative process modeling.

However, the case of cooperation in large-scale multi-agent systems (MAS) has not been thoroughly examined. Therefore, in this paper we present a framework for cooperative goal-satisfaction in large-scale environments focusing on a low-complexity physics-oriented approach. The multi-agent systems with which we deal are modeled by a physics-oriented model. According to the model, MAS inherit physical properties, and therefore the evolution of the computational systems is similar to the evolution of physical systems. To enable implementation of the model, we provide a detailed algorithm to be used by a single agent within the system. The model and the algorithm are appropriate for large-scale, dynamic, Distributed Problem Solver systems, in which agents try to increase the benefits of the whole system. The complexity is very low, and in some specific cases it is proved to be optimal. The analysis and assessment of the algorithm are performed via the well-known behavior and properties of the modeling physical system.",,"Algorithms; Computational complexity; Computational methods; Large scale systems; Mathematical models; Physical properties; Resource allocation; Multi agent system; Physics oriented model; Task allocation; Artificial intelligence"

The differences between QSAT and SAT in phase transition behavior that Cadoli et al report are largely due to the presence of trivially unsatisfiable problems. Once they are removed, we see behavior more familiar from SAT and other NP-complete domains. There are, however, some differences. Problems with short clauses show a large gap between worst case behavior and median, and the easy-hard-easy pattern is restricted to higher percentiles of search cost. We compute the 'constrainedness' of k-QSAT problems for any k, and use this to predict the location of phase transitions. We conjecture that these predictions are less accurate than in NP-complete problems because of the super-exponential size of the state space, and of the weakness of first moment methods in complexity classes above NP. Finally, we predict that similar phase transition behavior will occur in other PSPACE-complete problems like planning and game playing.",,"Computational complexity; Computational methods; Constraint theory; Game theory; Mathematical models; Method of moments; Polynomials; Problem solving; Random processes; Polynomial hierarchy; Quantified satisfiability; Artificial intelligence"

The method has shown to be effcient and robust in a considerable number of scientific domains, where the complexity and cardinality of the problems considered elected themselves as key factors to be taken into account.

The problem is tightly re- lated with the loss of genetic diversity of the GA's population, being the cause of a decrease on the quality of the solutions found. Out of question, this fact has lead to the development of different techniques aiming to solve, or at least to minimize the problem; traditional methods usually work to maintain a certain degree of genetic diversity on the target po- pulations, without affecting the convergence process of the GA.

We explore SAM, a novel complementary framework for social monitoring that utilizes knowledge of social relationships among agents in monitoring them. We compare the performance of SAM when monitoring is done by a single agent in a centralized fashion, versus team monitoring in a distributed fashion. We experiment with several SAM instantiations, algorithms that are sound and incomplete, unsound and complete, and both sound and complete. While a more complex algorithm appears useful in the centralized case (but is unsound), the surprising result is that a much simpler algorithm in the distributed case is both sound and complete.

We prove that achieving arc-consistency on the dual encoding is strictly stronger than achieving arc-consistency on the hidden variable, and this itself is equivalent to achieving generalized arc-consistency on the original (non-binary) problem. We also prove that, as a consequence of the unusual topology of the constraint graph in the hidden variable encoding, inverse consistencies like neighborhood inverse consistency and path inverse consistency collapse down onto arc-consistency.

The basis of such negotiations is inter-agent argumentation based on Toulmin's argumentation pattern. There are several novel aspects in our approach. First, our approach to argumentation exploits recently developed general, explicit teamwork models, which make it possible to provide a generalized and reusable argumentation facility based on teamwork constraints. Second, an emphasis on collaboration in argumentation leads to novel argumentation strategies geared towards benefiting the team rather than the individual.

For example, a robot may need to learn the most efficient routes between important sites in its environment. We compare on-line and off-line exploration for a repeated task, where the agent is given some particular task to perform some number of times. Tasks are modeled as navigation on a graph embedded in the plane. This paper describes a utility-based on-line exploration algorithm for repeated tasks, which takes into account both the costs and potential benefits (over future task repetitions) of different exploratory actions. Exploration is performed in a greedy fashion, with the locally optimal exploratory action performed on each task repetition. We experimentally evaluated our utility-based on-line algorithm against a heuristic search algorithm for off-line exploration as well as a randomized on-line exploration algorithm. We found that for a single repeated task, utility-based on-line exploration consistently outperforms the alternatives, unless the number of task repetitions is very high. In addition, we extended the algorithms for the case of multiple repeated tasks, where the agent has a different randomly-chosen task to perform each time. Here too, we found that utility-based on-line exploration is often preferred. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Given a set of agents and a set of tasks which they have to satisfy, we consider situations where each task should be attached to a group of agents that will perform the task. Task allocation to groups of agents is necessary when tasks cannot be performed by a single agent. However it may also be beneficial when groups perform more efficiently with respect to the single agents' performance. In this paper we present several solutions to the problem of task allocation among autonomous agents, and suggest that the agents form coalitions in order to perform tasks or improve the efficiency of their performance. We present efficient distributed algorithms with low ratio bounds and with low computational complexities. These properties are proven theoretically and supported by simulations and an implementation in an agent system. Our methods are based on both the algorithmic aspects of combinatorics and approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems. We first present an approach to agent coalition formation where each agent must be a member of only one coalition. Next, we present the domain of overlapping coalitions. We proceed with a discussion of the domain where tasks may have a precedence order. Finally, we discuss the case of implementation in an open, dynamic agent system. For each case we provide an algorithm that will lead agents to the formation of coalitions, where each coalition is assigned a task. Our algorithms are any-time algorithms, they are simple, efficient and easy to implement. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

A weaker form of this principle concluding only on the graded possibility of the similarity of the outcome attributes, is also considered. These two forms of the case-based reasoning principle are modelled in terms of fuzzy rules. Then an approximate reasoning machinery taking advantage of this principle enables us to apply the information stored in the memory of previous cases to the current problem. A particular instance of case-based reasoning, named case-based decision, is especially investigated. A logical formalization of the basic case-based reasoning inference is also proposed.

However, it is often the case that an agent is motivated to achieve some goal, where its achievement is only possible, made easier, or satisfied more completely, by gaining the collaboration of others. This collaboration requires the agents to communicate with one another in negotiation and in the coordination of their action. In this paper, it is assumed that such collaboration requires the agents involved to have some prior agreement on the actions that each can call on the others to do; their respective rights. A novel framework is introduced for describing agreements between agents based on rights, and it is indicated how agents may generate such agreements through negotiation. In particular, we focus on a discussion of the structure of an agreement, what it means for an agent to be committed to an agreement, and the communicative actions that agents use in the generation of agreements. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.",,"Artificial intelligence; Intelligent agents; Multi agent systems; Communicative actions; Joint Commitment; Autonomous agents"

We present SAM, a complementary approach to monitoring and diagnosis for multi-agent domains that is particularly well-suited for collaborative settings. SAM includes the following key novel concepts: First, SAM's failure detection technique, inspired by social psychology, utilizes other agents as information sources and detects failures both in an agent and in its teammates. Second, SAM performs social diagnosis, reasoning about the failures in its team using an explicit model of teamwork (previously, teamwork models have been employed only in prescribing agent behaviors in teamwork). Third, SAM employs model sharing to alleviate the inherent inefficiencies associated with representing multiple agent models.

Accuracy in this agent-tracking task is critically dependent on the accuracy of the tracker's (tracking agent's) model of the trackee (tracked agent). Unfortunately, in real-world situations, model imperfections arise due to the tracker's resource and information constraints, as well as due to trackees' dynamic behavior modification. While such model imperfections are unavoidable, a tracker must nonetheless attempt to be adaptive in its agent tracking. This article identifies key issues in adaptive agent tracking and presents an approach called DEFT. At its core, DEFT is based on discrimination-based learning. The main idea is to identify the deficiency of a model based on tracking failures, and revise the model by using features that are critical in discriminating successful and failed tracking episodes. Because in real-world situations the set of candidate discriminating features is very large, DEFT relies on knowledge-based focusing to limit the discrimination to those features that it determines were relevant in successful tracking episodes - with an autonomous explanation capability as a major source of this knowledge.

This fundamental shift in agent architectures is illustrated via an implemented candidate: STEAM. While STEAM is founded on the joint intentions theory, practical operationalization has required it to integrate several key novel concepts: (i) team synchronization to establish joint intentions; (ii) constructs for monitoring joint intentions and repair; and (iii) decision-theoretic communication selectivity (to pragmatically extend the joint intentions theory).

The algorithm use a branching rule based on the well known Decreasing Best Fit approximation algorithm. In addition, it includes a powerful pruning rule derived from a bound on the solution to the remaining subproblem. The bound is constructed by using modular arithmetic to decompose the numerical constraints. We show that the pruning rule adds essentially a constant factor overhead to runtime, whilst reducing search significantly. On the hardest problems, runtime can be reduced by an order of magnitude. Finally we demonstrate how propagation rules can be built by adding lookahead to pruning rules.

All these methods are shown to be equivalent with respect to their capabilities for reasoning with conditional knowledge although they are based on different modeling frameworks.

Indeed fuzzy sets can be used for describing weakly ordered sets of more or less acceptable/preferred situations, and possibility distributions represent states of information pervaded with imprecision and uncertainty. This framework relies on purely ordinal scales both for preferences and for uncertainty, due to the use of max and min operations and of an order-reversing operation for manipulating the levels of these two scales. Recently, a qualitative counterpart to von Neumann and Morgenstern' expected utility theory has been proposed, and it has been shown that the qualitative utility function, agreeing with a set of axioms describing decision-maker's behavior in face of uncertainty, is nothing but the necessity measure of a fuzzy event. This result is first recalled and its interpretation is discussed in the framework of possibility theory. It is related to previous proposals made by different authors in the fuzzy set literature. The necessity measure which is a pessimistic estimate is contrasted with the dual measure of possibility. This latter estimate is optimistic and deals in a symmetric way with the expression of preferences and the expression of what is known of the plausible states of the world. The intuition underlying the necessity measure is that the qualitative “expected” utility is all the greater as there is no situations with a high plausibility and low utility value. A refinement of the utility ordering is suggested in case several decisions receive the same evaluation. Then an illustrative example is provided. Lastly, applications to multistage decision making and to matrix games are briefly pointed out. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1997.",,"Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision theory; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Intelligent systems; Decision makers; Expected utility theory; Multistage decision making; Necessity measures; Possibility distributions; Possibility theory; Unified framework; Utility functions; Fuzzy set theory"

To facilitate the development of such systems a number of generic DAI frameworks have been devised. These frameworks typically aid the development process by providing a language, a set of structures, and/or some tools with which the necessary infrastructure and support mechanisms for interacting agents can be instantiated. The paper reports on one such framework, called ARCHON, which has been used to build DAI systems in the following industrial control domains: electricity distribution management, electricity transportation management, cement factory control, particle accelerator control and flexible assembly robotic cells. A distinguishing and novel feature of the ARCHON framework is that it extends the level of support offered to the system builder -it provides generic and reusable knowledge about the process of co-operation, in addition to the more standard development facilities. This generic knowledge is embedded in a domain-independent co-ordination module and it is the rationale, design, implementation and evaluation of this module which forms the major contribution of the paper.

Agent tracking - monitoring other agent's actions and inferring their higher-level goals and intentions - is a central requirement in such worlds. While previous work has mostly focused on tracking individual agents, this paper goes beyond by focusing on agent teams. Team tracking poses the challenge of tracking a team's joint goals and plans. Dynamic, real-time environments add to the challenge, as ambiguities have to be resolved in real-time. The central hypothesis underlying the present work is that an explicit team-oriented perspective enables effective team tracking. This hypothesis is instantiated using the model tracing technology employed in tracking individual agents. Thus, to track team activities, team models are put to service. Team models are a concrete application of the joint intentions framework and enable an agent to track team activities, regardless of the agent's being a collaborative participant or a non-participant in the team. To facilitate real-time ambiguity resolution with team models: (i) aspects of tracking are cast as constraint satisfaction problems to exploit constraint propagation techniques; and (ii) a cost minimality criterion is applied to constrain tracking search. Empirical results from two separate tasks in real-world, dynamic environments - one collaborative and one competitive - are provided.",,"Algorithms; Computer simulation; Constraint theory; Cost effectiveness; Monitoring; Robotics; Agent teams; Constraint satisfaction; Model tracing; Team models; Team tracking; Artificial intelligence"

One of the major arguments of Bayesian probability proponents is that representing uncertainty is always decision-driven and as a consequence, uncertainty should be represented by probability. Here we argue that representing partial ignorance is not always decision-driven. Other reasoning tasks such as belief revision for instance are more naturally carried out at the purely cognitive level. Conceiving knowledge representation and decision-making as separate concerns opens the way to nonpurely probabilistic representations of incomplete knowledge. It is pointed out that within a numerical framework, two numbers are needed to account for partial ignorance about events, because on top of truth and falsity, the state of total ignorance must be encoded independently of the number of underlying alternatives. The paper also points out that it is consistent to accept a Bayesian view of decision-making and a non-Bayesian view of knowledge representation because it is possible to map nonprobabilistic degrees of belief to betting probabilities when needed. Conditioning rules in non-Bayesian settings are reviewed, and the difference between focusing on a reference class and revising due to the arrival of new information is pointed out.

It is pointed out that most fuzzy control inferences used for interpolation and approximation of functions have little to do with Zadeh's theory of approximate reasoning. However, it is shown that interpolative reasoning is captured by gradual rules to which the generalized modus ponens is applied. Due to close links between gradual rules and the extension principle, a method for the synthesis of a fuzzy rule-based systems that qualitatively describes the function behavior is outlined. The theory of gradual rules also enables the coherence of a fuzzy rule-based system to be analyzed. Lastly, when the rule base is incomplete, a fuzzy extension of linear interpolation is described. Overall fuzzy logic is claimed to be more adapted to the linguistic description of systems than to the efficient approximation of functions.","Fuzzy control; Fuzzy logic; Gradual rule; Interpolation",

Grosz and C. Sidner (1990) was developed to provide a model of collaborative planning in which it was not necessary for one agent to have intentions-to toward an act of a different agent. Unlike other contemporaneous approaches (J.R. Searle, 1990), this formulation provided for two agents to coordinate their activities without introducing any notion of irreducible joint intentions. However, it only treated activities that directly decomposed into single-agent actions, did not address the need for agents to commit to their joint activity, and did not adequately deal with agents having only partial knowledge of the way in which to perform an action. This paper provides a revised and expanded version of SharedPlans that addresses these shortcomings. It also reformulates Pollack's (1990) definition of individual plans to handle cases in which a single agent has only partial knowledge; this reformulation meshes with the definition of SharedPlans. The new definitions also allow for contracting out certain actions. The formalization that results has the features required by Bratman's (1992) account of shared cooperative activity and is more general than alternative accounts (H. Levesque et al., 1990; E.

To act intelligently in such an environment, an automated agent needs an event tracking capability to continually monitor the occurrence of such events and the temporal relationships among them. This capability enables an agent to infer the occurrence of important unobserved events as well as to obtain a better understanding of the interaction among events. This article focuses on event tracking in one complex and dynamic multiagent environment: the air-combat simulation environment. It analyzes the challenges that an automated pilot agent must face when tracking events in this environment. This analysis reveals three new issues that have not been addressed in previous work in this area: (i) tracking events generated by agents' flexible and reactive behaviors, (ii) tracking events in the context of continuous agent interactions, and (iii) tracking events in real time. This article proposes one solution to address these issues. One key idea in this solution is that the (architectural) mechanisms that an agent employs in generating its own flexible and reactive behaviors can be used to track other agents' flexible and reactive behaviors in real time. A second key idea is the use of a world-centered representation for modeling agent interactions. The solution is demonstrated using an implementation of an automated pilot agent.","Event tracking; Multiagent systems; Plan recognition; Real-time performance; Real-world applications","Calculations; Data processing; Social sciences; Social sciences computing; Event tracking; Multiagent systems; Real-time performance; Artificial intelligence"

We show that the ""conventional"" picture of easy-hard-easy problem difficulty is inadequate. In particular, there is a region of very variable problem difficulty where problems are typically underconstrained and satisfiable. Within this region, problems can be orders of magnitude harder than problems in the middle of the satisfiability phase transition. These extraordinarily hard problems appear to be associated with a ""constraint gap"". That is, a region where search is a maximum as the amount of constraint propagation is a minimum. We show that the position and shape of this constraint gap change little with problem size. Unlike hard problems in the middle of the satisfiability phase transition, hard problems in the variable region are not critically constrained between satisfiability and unsatisfiability. Indeed, hard problems in the variable region often contain a small and unique minimal unsatisfiable subset or reduce at an early stage in search to a hard unsatisfiable subproblem with a small and unique minimal unsatisfiable subset. The difficulty in solving such problems is thus in identifying the minimal unsatisfiable subset from the many irrelevant clauses. The existence of a constraint gap greatly hinders our ability to find such minimal unsatisfiable subsets. However, it remains open whether these problems remain hard for more intelligent backtracking procedures. We conjecture that these results will generalize both to other SAT problem classes, and to the phase transitions of other NP-hard problems.","Constraint propagation; Hard problems; Satisfiability; Search phase transitions","Computational complexity; Computational methods; Constraint theory; Problem solving; Random processes; Constraint gap; Constraint propagation; Problem difficulty; Randomly generated problem; Satisfiability phase transition; Search phase transitions; Artificial intelligence"

Different ideas of orderings play a role in these reasoning processes: plausibility orderings between interpretations or situations which are unequally uncertain, similarity orderings with respect to prototypical situations or cases, preference orderings between acts or situations when the problem is a matter of choice. These orderings can be encoded using purely ordinal scales, or scales with a richer structure (when it is meaningful and compatible with the quality of the available information). This general idea of ordering provides a kind of unification between the different reasoning modes and somewhat typifies approximate and commonsense reasoning. Advances in default reasoning, inconsistency handling, data fusion, updating, abductive reasoning, interpolative reasoning, and decision issues in relation with Artificial Intelligence research, are briefly reviewed. Open questions and directions for future research which seem especially important for the development of practical applications are pointed out. The paper is largely based on authors' research experience, and as such, presents a rather personal view, which may not be exempt from some biases. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1996.",,"Artificial intelligence; Data fusion; Intelligent systems; Abductive reasoning; Artificial intelligence research; Commonsense reasoning; Generic expression; Inconsistency handling; Interpolative reasoning; Practical problems; Research experience; Data handling"

Agent tracking is one key capability required for intelligent interaction. It involves monitoring the observable actions of other agents and inferring their unobserved actions, plans, goals and behaviors. This article examines the implications of such an agent tracking capability for agent architectures. It specifically focuses on real-time and dynamic environments, where an intelligent agent is faced with the challenge of tracking the highly flexible mix of goal-driven and reactive behaviors of other agents, in real-time. The key implication is that an agent architecture needs to provide direct support for flexible and efficient reasoning about other agents' models. In this article, such support takes the form of an architectural capability to execute the other agent's models, enabling mental simulation of their behaviors. Other architectural requirements that follow include the capabilities for (pseudo-) simultaneous execution of multiple agent models, dynamic sharing and unsharing of multiple agent models and high bandwidth inter-model communication. We have implemented an agent architecture, an experimental variant of the Soar integrated architecture, that conforms to all of these requirements. Agents based on this architecture have been implemented to execute two different tasks in a real-time, dynamic, multi-agent domain. The article presents experimental results illustrating the agents' dynamic behavior. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1996.",,"Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Intelligent agents; Multi agent systems; Agent architectures; Dynamic environments; Integrated architecture; Intelligent interactions; Mental simulation; Multi-agent environment; Reactive behavior; Tracking capability; Memory architecture"

Among individual rational agents, such coalitions will form if, and only if, each member of a coalition gains more if it joins the coalition than it could gain previously. There are several models of creating such coalitions and dividing the joint payoff among the members. In this paper we present a model for coalition formation and payoff distribution in general environments. We focus on a reduced complexity kernel-oriented coalition formation model. The model is partitioned into two levels — a social level and a strategic level. This partition enables one to distinguish between regulations that must be agreed upon and are forced by the designers of the agents, and strategies by which each agent acts and that can be adopted at will. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1996.",,"Artificial intelligence; Agent coalition formation; Coalition formations; Joint payoffs; Rational agents; Reduced complexity; Strategic level; Task executions; Autonomous agents"

We propose a strategic model of negotiation that takes the passage of time during the negotiation process itself into account. A distributed negotiation mechanism is introduced that is simple, efficient, stable, and flexible in various situations. The model considers situations characterized by complete as well as incomplete information, and ones in which some agents lose over time while others gain over time. Using this negotiation mechanism autonomous agents have simple and stable negotiation strategies that result in efficient agreements without delays even when there are dynamic changes in the environment. © 1995.",,"Computer simulation; Constraint theory; Distributed computer systems; Resource allocation; Software engineering; Autonomous agents; Distributed artificial intelligence; Multiagent negotiation; Task distribution; Artificial intelligence"

As a consequence of the experience gained whilst building a number of DAI systems for industrial applications, a new principled model of cooperation has been developed. This model, called Joint Responsibility, has the notion of joint intentions at its core. It specifies pre-conditions which must be attained before collaboration can commence and prescribes how individuals should behave both when joint activity is progressing satisfactorily and also when it runs into difficulty. The theoretical model has been used to guide the implementation of a general-purpose cooperation framework and the qualitative and quantitative benefits of this implementation have been assessed through a series of comparative experiments in the real-world domain of electricity transportation management. Finally, the success of the approach of building a system with an explicit and grounded representation of cooperative problem solving is used to outline a proposal for the next generation of multi-agent systems. © 1995.",,"Computer simulation; Computer systems; Industrial applications; Problem solving; Technology; Cooperative problem solving; Distributed artificial intelligence; Electricity transportation management; Joint intentions; Multi agent systems; Artificial intelligence"

In [74], the unique-attribute representation was introduced to eliminate combinatorics from the match. However, in so doing, unique-attributes engender a sufficiently negative set of trade-offs, so that investigating whether there are alternative representations that yield better trade-offs becomes of critical importance. This article identifies two promising spaces of such alternatives, and explores a number of the alternatives within these spaces. The first space is generated from local syntactic restrictions on working memory. Within this space, unique-attributes is shown to be the best alternative possible. The second space comes from restrictions on the search performed during the match of individual productions (match-search). In particular, this space is derived from the combination of a new, more relaxed, match formulation (instantiationless match) and a set of restrictions derived from the constraint-satisfaction literature. Within this space, new alternatives are found that outperform unique-attributes in some, but not yet all, domains. © 1994.",,"Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Expert systems; Learning systems; Logic programming; Mathematical models; Real time systems; Local syntactic restrictions; Machine learning; Noncombinatorial match; Search restrictions; Knowledge based systems"

Two resolution rules are used for coping with the different situations, and the classical refutation method can be generalized with these rules. Also, the lower bounds are allowed to be functions of variables involved in the clauses, which results in hypothetical reasoning capabilities. In cases where only lower bounds of necessity measures are involved, a semantics is proposed in which the completeness of the extended resolution principle is proved.

In these two formalisms the current state of knowledge is generally represented by a [0,1]‐valued function whose domain is an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive possible states of the world. However, in possibility theory, the unit‐interval can be viewed as a purely ordinal scale. Two general kinds of operations can be defined on this assignment function: conditioning, and imaging (or “projection”). the difference between these two operations is analogous to the one made between belief revision à la Gärdenfors and updating à la Katsuno and Mendelzon in the logical framework. In the probabilistic framework these two operations are respectively Bayesian conditioning and Lewis' imaging. Counterparts to these operations are presented for the possibilistic framework including the case of conditioning upon uncertain observations, and justifications are given which parallel the ones existing for the probabilistic operations. More particularly, it is recalled that possibilistic conditioning satisfies all the postulates proposed by Alchourrón, Gärdenfors and Makinson for belief revision (stated in possibilistic terms), and it is proved that possibilistic imaging satisfies all the postulates proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon. the situation where our current knowledge is stated in terms of weighted logical propositions is discussed in connection to possibility theory. Revision in other more complex numerical formalisms, namely belief and plausibility functions, and upper and lower probabilities is also surveyed. Recent results on the revision of conditional knowledge bases are also reviewed. the frameworks of belief functions, upper and lower probabilities and conditional bases are more sophisticated than the previous ones because they enable to distinguish between factual evidence and generic knowledge in a cognitive state. This, framework leads to two forms of belief revision respectively taking care of the revision of evidence and the revision of knowledge. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

A 'selfish' agent may convince another 'selfish' agent to help it with its task, even if the agents are not assumed to be benevolent, by promises of rewards. We propose techniques that provide efficient ways to reach subcontracting in varied situations: the agents have full information about the environment and each other vs. subcontracting when the agents don't know the exact state of the world. We consider situations of repeated encounters, cases of asymmetric information, situations where the agents lack information about each other, and cases where an agent subcontracts a task to a group of agents. We also consider situations where there is a competition either among contracted agents or contracting agents. In all situations we would like the contracted agent to carry out the task efficiently without the need of close supervision by the contracting agent.

Yet reuse is a primary consideration for any organisation with a large software base. To redress the balance, this paper reports on an experiment undertaken at the CERN laboratories in which two pre-existing and standalone expert systems for diagnosing faults in a particle accelerator were transformed into a community of cooperating agents. The experiences and insights gained during this process provide a valuable first step towards satisfying the needs of potential users of DAI technology-identifying the types of changes required for cooperative problem solving, quantifying the effort involved in transforming standalone systems to ones suitable for cooperation and highlighting the benefits of a cooperating systems approach in a realistic industrial application. © 1993.","cooperating expert systems; Distributed Artificial Intelligence; fault diagnosis; multi-agent systems; particle accelerator control",

Dempster's rule of conditioning is carefully examined and compared to upper and lower conditional probabilities. Although both notions are extensions of conditioning, they cannot serve the same purpose. The notion of focusing, as a change of reference class, is introduced and opposed to updating. Dempster's rule is good for updating, whereas the other form of conditioning expresses a focusing operation. In particular, the concept of focusing models the meaning of uncertain statements in a more natural way than updating. Finally, it is suggested that Dempster's rules of conditioning and combination can be justified by the Bayers rule itself.

Also, a significant part of the text is devoted to the representation of truth-qualified, certainty-qualified and possibility-qualified fuzzy statements. A new attempt to classify the numerous models of fuzzy ""if...then"" rules from a semantic point of view is presented. In the past, people have classified them according to algebraic properties of the underlying implication, or by putting constraints on the expected behavior of the inference process (by analogy with classical logic), or by running extensive comparative trials of particular implications on test-examples. Here the classification is based on whether the rules qualify the truth, the certainty or the possibility of their conclusions. Each case corresponds to a specific way of deriving the underlying conditional possibility distribution. This paper focuses on semantic approaches to approximate reasoning based on fuzzy sets, commonly exemplified by the generalized modus ponens, but also considers applications to current topics in Artificial Intelligence such as default reasoning and qualitative process modeling. A companion survey paper is devoted to syntax-oriented methods. © 1991.","Approximate reasoning; fuzzy logic; generalized modus ponens; possibility theory; uncertainty",

We develop a general solution, involving restricting the scope of nonmonotonic reasoning, and show that it remedies these problems in a variety of formalisms.

Most importantly, no modification of the underlying formalisms is required, and the result is semantically compatible with existing approaches.

In spite of the growing bulk of works dealing with deviant models of uncertainty in artificial intelligence, there is a strong reaction of classical probability tenants claiming that new uncertainty theories are at best unnecessary and at worst misleading. Interestingly enough, however, the trend to go beyond probabilistic models of subjective uncertainty is emerging even in the orthodox field of decision theory to account for the systematic deviations of human behavior from the expected utility models. The chapter presents the points of view of probability theory and those of two presently popular alternative settings: possibility theory and the theory of evidence.

The development of fuzzy sets and possibility theory has produced a unified and powerful framework (where the dual concepts of possibility and necessity play an important role) for dealing with imprecision and uncertainty in a nonprobabilistic way. This paper presents the basic tools and results of the possibilistic approach for the representation of imprecise or uncertain knowledge and the propagation of uncertainty in deductive inferences as well as in combination of information issued from different sources. The paper surveys existing application-oriented fuzzy expert systems and is also devoted to a discussion of the potential of fuzzy expert systems in the area of production research.",,"MANAGEMENT; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES - Fuzzy Sets; DEDUCTIVE INFERENCES; FUZZY EXPERT SYSTEMS; IMPRECISION; POSSIBILITY THEORY; UNCERTAINTY; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE"

The focus is on numerical approaches based on certainty factor, probability, possibility or evidence theory. The discussion is organized around three topics, namely knowledge representation, inductive versus deductive reasoning, and control strategies. The aim of the paper is to outline a tentative classification of emerging trends in uncertain reasoning, and to point out problems which are not solved yet or are sometimes overlooked by proponents of a single approach.

The notion of a twofold fuzzy set is introduced when the relevant information for determining the membership status is incomplete. A twofold fuzzy set is made of a nested pair of fuzzy sets: the one which gathers the elements which more or less necessarily belong and the one which gathers the elements which more or less possibly belong. Twofold fuzzy sets are compared from a frontal and from a semantical point of view with other proposals and particularly with the notion of a rough set recently introduced by Pawlak. Set operations of twofold fuzzy sets are discussed and the cardinality of a twofold fuzzy set is defined. Twofold fuzzy relations are also introduced. Finally, various applications of twofold fuzzy sets in knowledge representation are briefly discussed. © 1987.","Fuzzy set; Incomplete information; Knowledge representation; Necessity measure; Possibility measure; Rough set","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - Expert Systems; KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION; NECESSITY MEASURE; POSSIBILITY MEASURE; ROUGH SETS; TWOFOLD FUZZY SETS; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES"

Namely the problem of the shape analysis of a segmented contour, in terms of geometrical categories, as used by individuals, is considered. The shape analysis is performed by decomposition of the original contour into several levels of details corresponding to non-convex parts of the contour. A fuzzy labeling procedure then calculates a degree of matching between a convex outline and ideal standard geometrical shapes. Several types of models are used for the description of objects, according to whether they are convex or not, contain more than one region or not. Shapes are identified without the usual preliminary learning stage, and on the basis of non-contextual, dimensionless features.",,"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - Expert Systems; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES - Fuzzy Sets; ROBOTICS - Vision Systems; SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND CYBERNETICS - Man Machine Systems; COMPUTER VISION; SHAPE ANALYSIS; PATTERN RECOGNITION SYSTEMS"

It is based on a heuristic technique for sequencing the jobs. It is actually run in a real workshop. An expert system methodology currently under development for the same kind of problem is also discussed. The idea is to be able to integrate two kinds of knowledge about the production process: theoretical knowledge (issued from scheduling theory) which achieves the management of time, and practical knowledge (provided by the shop-floor manager) about specific technological constraints which must be satisfied by the actual production process. These constraints are usually not taken into account at the theoretical level. The knowledge representation and processing techniques of artificial intelligence enable realistic schedules to be obtained by simultaneous use of both sources of information.",,"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - Expert Systems; SCHEDULING - Computer Applications; DUE-DATE CONSTRAINTS; HEURISTIC TECHNIQUES; JOBSHOP SCHEDULING; TIMETABLE CONSTRAINTS; PRODUCTION CONTROL"

It is pointed out that the choice of the implication function for representing the rule 'if X is A, then Y is B' is completely determined by the choice of the conjunctive operation used for aggregating an a priori possibility distribution with a conditional possibility distribution. This aggregation is performed as most authors do by the minimum operation. The generalized modus tollens, the treatment of truth-qualified rules and the processing of a collection of conditional rules providing an incomplete description of a causal link, are studied. The generalized modus ponens, as a pattern of deductive reasoning taking into account the fuzziness of premises, is contrasted with patterns of plausible reasoning. The generalized modus ponens as such turns out to be a basic tool for dealing with imprecision in rule-based expert systems.",,"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - Expert Systems; COMPUTER METATHEORY; IMPLICATION FUNCTION; MODUS PONENS; POSSIBILITY DISTRIBUTION; POSSIBILITY THEORY; SUP-MIN COMPOSITION; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES"
