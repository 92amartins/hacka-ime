A qualitative comparative analysis of published papers on the effects of chemotherapy on QoL in dogs and cats were conducted. This was supplemented with a comparison of the parameters and domains used in veterinary QoL-assessments with those used in the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) questionnaire designed to assess QoL in toddlers. Each of the identified publications including QoL-assessment in dogs and cats receiving chemotherapy applied a different method of QoL-assessment. In addition, the veterinary QoL-assessments were mainly focused on physical clinical parameters, whereas the emotional (6/11), social (4/11) and role (4/11) domains were less represented. QoL-assessment of cats and dogs receiving chemotherapy is in its infancy. The most commonly reported method to assess QoL was questionnaire based and mostly included physical and clinical parameters. Standardizing and including a complete range of potentially relevant parameters in future QoL assessments may benefit owner decision making. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","chemotherapy; comparative oncology; oncology; small animal; small animal internal medicine"

Decreased risk of hyperthyroidism has been reported in certain colorpoint breeds, and this observation previously has been hypothesized to result from relatively greater tyrosine availability for thyroid hormone production because of limited ability to convert tyrosine to melanin pigment. However, studies investigating a potential link between coat pigmentation and risk of hyperthyroidism are limited. Objective: To identify associations between coat phenotype and hyperthyroidism by investigation of breed, coat color, and hair length as risk factors for the disease. Animals: Data were used from 4,705 cats aged ≥10 years, referred to a single veterinary teaching hospital (2006–2014) in the United Kingdom. Methods: Retrospective, epidemiological, cross-sectional study using Bayesian multivariable logistic regression to assess risk factors for hyperthyroidism. Results: Burmese (odds ratio [OR], 0.01; 0.00–0.23; P =.004), Tonkinese (OR, 0.05; 0.00–0.95; P =.046), Persian (OR, 0.21; 0.10–0.44; P <.001), Siamese (OR, 0.27; 0.12–0.61; P =.002), Abyssinian (OR, 0.04; 0.00–0.74; P =.031), and British shorthair (OR, 0.47; 0.28–0.79; P =.004) breeds had decreased risk of hyperthyroidism compared to domestic shorthairs. Longhaired, nonpurebred cats (OR, 1.30; 1.03–1.64; P =.028) were at increased risk of hyperthyroidism. Coat color/pattern was not associated with hyperthyroidism in nonpurebred cats. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: We identified decreased risk of hyperthyroidism in the Tonkinese, Abyssinian, and British shorthair breeds, identified an association between risk of hyperthyroidism and hair length, and confirmed decreased risk in Burmese, Siamese, and Persian breeds. Additional studies are warranted to further investigate these findings. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

No such clinical trials have been performed in dogs. Objective: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of intranasal midazolam (IN-MDZ), via a mucosal atomization device, as a first-line management option for canine status epilepticus and compare it to rectal administration of diazepam (R-DZP) for controlling status epilepticus before intravenous access is available. Animals: Client-owned dogs with idiopathic or structural epilepsy manifesting status epilepticus within a hospital environment were used. Dogs were randomly allocated to treatment with IN-MDZ (n = 20) or R-DZP (n = 15). Methods: Randomized parallel-group clinical trial. Seizure cessation time and adverse effects were recorded. For each dog, treatment was considered successful if the seizure ceased within 5 minutes and did not recur within 10 minutes after administration. The 95% confidence interval was used to detect the true population of dogs that were successfully treated. The Fisher's 2-tailed exact test was used to compare the 2 groups, and the results were considered statistically significant if P <.05. Results: IN-MDZ and R-DZP terminated status epilepticus in 70% (14/20) and 20% (3/15) of cases, respectively (P =.0059). All dogs showed sedation and ataxia. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: IN-MDZ is a quick, safe and effective first-line medication for controlling status epilepticus in dogs and appears superior to R-DZP. IN-MDZ might be a valuable treatment option when intravenous access is not available and for treatment of status epilepticus in dogs at home. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Cardiopulmonary depression could affect outcome in dogs undergoing general anesthesia for surgical treatment of thoracolumbar intervertebral disk extrusion (IVDE). Hypothesis/Objectives: To evaluate the effects of general anesthesia on functional outcome in dogs undergoing surgery to treat thoracolumbar IVDE. Animals: Eighty-four client-owned dogs with acute thoracolumbar IVDE treated by decompressive hemilaminectomy. Methods: Exploratory, retrospective observational study. Medical records were reviewed for clinical presentation and anesthetic monitoring variables, including duration of anesthesia and surgery, hypotension, bradycardia, temperature, and respiratory parameters. Multivariable regression tree analysis was performed to explore associations between anesthetic variables and functional outcome scores after 6 weeks, as well as return to ambulatory status. Results: Episodes of bradycardia (69%) and hypotension (57%) were frequent. Across all outcome measures, regression tree analysis highlighted functional grade at presentation as the primary determining factor, and among pain perception negative dogs, there was a possible association between increased duration of surgery and poorer outcome. In dogs with intact pain perception, duration of bradycardia, mean body temperature, and mean end-tidal carbon dioxide were highlighted. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Exploratory statistical methods can facilitate hypothesis-generating studies to inform prospective investigations in veterinary medicine. Although the mechanism is uncertain, increased duration of surgery might be associated with poorer outcome in pain perception negative dogs with thoracolumbar IVDE. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Objectives: To describe the outcome of 96 dogs treated medically or surgically for SAD. Animals: Ninety-six dogs with SAD. Methods: Retrospective case series. Medical records were searched for spinal arachnoid diverticula and all dogs with information on treatment were included. Outcome was assessed with a standardized questionnaire. Results: Fifty dogs were managed medically and 46 dogs were treated surgically. Dogs that underwent surgery were significantly younger than dogs that received medical management. No other variables, related to clinical presentation, were significantly different between both groups of dogs. The median follow-up time was 16 months (1–90 months) in the medically treated and 23 months (1–94 months) in the surgically treated group. Of the 38 dogs treated surgically with available long-term follow-up, 82% (n = 31) improved, 3% (n = 1) remained stable and 16% (n = 6) deteriorated after surgery. Of the 37 dogs treated medically with available long-term follow-up, 30% (n = 11) improved, 30% (n = 11) remained stable, and 40% (n = 15) deteriorated. Surgical treatment was more often associated with clinical improvement compared to medical management (P =.0002). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The results of this study suggest that surgical treatment might be superior to medical treatment in the management of SAD in dogs.

ACTH might be unintentionally injected into the perivascular (PV) space. Objective: To compare stimulation test results after IV and PV injections of ACTH. Animals: Twenty privately owned dogs were studied: 10 healthy and 10 with trilostane-treated naturally occurring hyperadrenocorticism (HAC). Methods: Prospective study. Each of 20 dogs underwent 2 ACTHst not <4 nor more than 14 days apart. Five healthy and 5 HAC dogs had an IV ACTHst first and PV second; 5 healthy and 5 HAC dogs had a PV ACTHst first and IV second. Blood samples for measurement of serum cortisol concentration were collected before and 1 hour after ACTH administration. Results: No significant difference in results was demonstrated when comparing serum cortisol concentrations after IV and PV ACTH administration in all 20 dogs (median μg/dL; interval μg/dL: 8.2; 1.4–17.4 versus 7.8; 0.9–16.9; P =.23). No significant difference in results was demonstrated when comparing serum cortisol concentrations after IV and PV ACTH administration in the 10 healthy dogs (median μg/dL; interval μg/dL: 10.9; 7.3–17.4 versus 10.6; 7.1–16.9; P =.54) or in the 10 HAC dogs (median μg/dL; interval μg/dL: 6.3; 1.4–8.6 versus 5.2; 0.9–8.7; P =.061). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Perivascular administration of ACTH does not significantly alter stimulation test results in healthy dogs or in dogs with HAC undergoing therapy with trilostane.

Biomarkers would provide additional support for the diagnosis of hypertension. Hypothesis: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC) are predictors of systemic hypertension, will be increased in cats with hypertension with or without ocular-TOD, and will decrease with antihypertensive treatment. Methods: Plasma VEGF, NT-proBNP, and cTnI concentrations and UPC were determined in healthy geriatric cats, normotensive cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertensive cats with evidence of hypertensive retinopathy (HT-ocular-TOD), and hypertensive cats without hypertensive ocular-TOD (HT-noTOD). Comparisons among groups were performed. Multivariable binary logistic regression models were built to identify independent biomarkers of hypertension and ocular-TOD. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to assess clinical use. Results: Cats with HT-ocular-TOD had significantly higher VEGF than all other groups (P <.05) and significantly higher NT-proBNP than healthy cats (P <.001). Healthy cats had significantly lower cTnI than all other groups (P <.05). No differences were found among groups for UPC (P =.08). Cardiac troponin I and VEGF were independent predictors of hypertension (P <.05), but none of the biomarkers were independent predictors of ocular-TOD. N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide concentrations decreased with antihypertensive treatment (P <.001). The ROC curves indicated that none of the biomarkers met the criteria to function as diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of hypertension or associated ocular-TOD. Conclusions and Clinical Significance: Despite statistical significance and changes with ocular-TOD, antihypertensive treatment, or both, VEGF, NT-proBNP, and cTnI did not function as useful diagnostic tests for hypertension. Persistently increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements in combination with fundoscopy remains the preferred method for diagnosis of feline hypertension. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

All cats admitted to the Miharu shelter, Fukushima Prefecture from 2012 to 2014 were included in the study. The results demonstrate that in situ corticosteroid and antibiotic use were associated with cats subsequently developing upper respiratory infections (URI). Disease and cat behavior were unassociated with adoption. Cats in group housing had lower stress metrics than cats individually housed. Prevalences of URI pathogens exceeded 80%, but symptomatic cats were uncommon. Environmental enrichment and stress reduction strategies are important in controlling URI and reducing the need for corticosteroids and antibiotics in shelters. Preemptive protocols are important in preventing shelter admission of cats during disasters. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Animal shelter; Disaster veterinary medicine; Feline upper respiratory disease; Stress"

We describe a Maine Coon cross cat with echocardiographically and pathologically documented LVNC. The cat was from a research colony and was heterozygous for the cardiac myosin binding protein C mutation associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in Maine Coon cats (A31P). The cat had had echocardiographic examinations performed every 6 months until 6 years of age at which time the cat died of an unrelated cause. Echocardiographic findings consistent with LVNC (moth-eaten appearance to the inner wall of the mid- to apical region of the left ventricle (LV) in cross section and trabeculations of the inner LV wall that communicated with the LV chamber) first were identified at 2 years of age. At necropsy, pathologic findings of LVNC were verified and included the presence of noncompacted myocardium that consisted of endothelial-lined trabeculations and sinusoids that constituted more than half of the inner part of the LV wall. The right ventricular (RV) wall also was affected. Histopathology identified myofiber disarray, which is characteristic of HCM, although heart weight was normal and LV wall thickness was not increased. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Objective: To evaluate clinical signs, echocardiographic features, and outcome of balloon valvuloplasty (BV) in dogs with severe tricuspid valve stenosis (TVS) in which BV was attempted. Animals: Five client-owned dogs with severe TVS. Methods: Records were retrospectively reviewed and data collected regarding signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic findings, procedures, and outcome. Results: All dogs were Labrador Retrievers. Presenting complaints included episodic weakness/syncope (4/5), abdominal distension (4/5), lethargy (2/5), and exercise intolerance (2/5). The median and range of measurements before BV were as follows: TV mean velocity 1.5 m/s (range 1.4–1.7 m/s); velocity-time integral (VTI) 79.8 cm (42.4–99.1 cm); and TV maximum velocity 2.9 m/s (2.3–3.2 m/s). Measurements (available for 3 of 5 dogs) after BV were as follows: TV mean velocity 1.15 m/s (0.9–1.4 m/s); VTI 44.95 cm (41.4–54.8 cm); and TV maximum velocity 1.15 m/s (1.9–2.3 m/s). The procedure was attempted in all dogs and completed in 4/5 dogs. The largest balloon diameter ranged from 15 mm to 25 mm, and length ranged from 4 cm to 5 cm. Right atrial pressure decreased in 4/5 dogs. All but 1 dog had clinical improvement after BV, but recurrence of clinical signs occurred (2/5). Tricuspid regurgitation worsened in 1 dog culminating in right heart failure and euthanasia. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: BV can be an effective treatment; however, clinical signs can recur. Right heart failure due to worsened TR is a potential complication in dogs with pre-existing moderate-to-severe TR. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Previous studies have shown conflicting data about predictors of hypocalcemia after these procedures. Hypothesis/Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate whether ionized calcium (iCa) concentrations before treatment are predictive of hypocalcemia or its clinical signs after surgical removal or heat ablation in dogs with primary hyperparathyroidism. Animals: Fifty-four dogs with primary hyperparathyroidism (29 female, 25 male; 49 retrospective, 5 prospective). Methods: Dogs were enrolled if they met the inclusion criteria: persistent hypercalcemia (iCa >1.41 mmol/L) due to primary hyperparathyroidism and absence of preemptive calcitriol treatment. All dogs were treated with parathyroidectomy (n = 37) or percutaneous ultrasound-guided heat ablation (n = 17). After treatment, iCa was monitored twice daily until plateau or intervention. Results: There was a moderate correlation between before-treatment hypercalcemia and after-treatment hypocalcemia. The prospective study was terminated due to ethical concerns given findings in the retrospective section. All dogs were placed into groups according to their pretreatment iCa: 1.46–1.61 mmol/L, 1.62–1.71 mmol/L, iCa 1.72–1.81 mmol/L, or >1.81 mmol/L. After treatment, the mean lowest iCa for each group, respectively, was 1.19, 1.18, 1.13, and 1.01 mmol/L. There was a significant association between higher group and proportion of dogs with iCa <1.00 mmol/L (P =.014). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: This study demonstrates a moderate correlation between iCa concentration before treatment and hypocalcemia after treatment. Dogs with higher initial iCa concentrations should be treated to prevent rapid decline and development of clinical hypocalcemia. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Limited information is available with regard to outcome, prognostic indicators, and associations with concurrent diseases. Hypothesis/Objectives: To report outcomes and associations between outcome and clinical and laboratory parameters, and presence of concurrent illness. Animals: Sixty-eight horses; 52 Quarter horses and related breeds and 16 other breeds. Methods: Retrospective cohort study (1991–2014). Medical records of horses with histological diagnosis of IMM were reviewed. Data recovery included signalment, laboratory variables, therapy, and outcome. Logistic regression was used to quantify the association between potential prognostic factors and survival to discharge. Results: Quarter horses were younger (mean < 4 years, range 3 months–21 years) than other breeds (mean < 10 years, range 1–23 years). Pathogens causing concurrent or recent infection included S. equi equi, S. equi zooepidemicus, C. pseudotuberculosis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, herpes virus-1, and influenza. The most common clinical signs consisted of rapidly progressive diffuse symmetrical muscle atrophy (80%), stiff gait (74%), and fever (44%). All horses that received medical therapy immediately upon admission survived to discharge (survival proportion = 87%). Leucocytosis was a common finding (60%). Horses with concurrent fever and other illness had a poor prognosis for hospital discharge. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Horses with IMM can have a favorable outcome. Horses with concurrent fever and another illness had decreased probability of survival to discharge. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Our objective was to develop an extension of the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement that addresses unique reporting requirements for observational studies in veterinary medicine related to health, production, welfare, and food safety. We conducted a consensus meeting with 17 experts in Mississauga, Canada. Experts completed a premeeting survey about whether items in the STROBE statement should be modified or added to address unique issues related to observational studies in animal species with health, production, welfare, or food safety outcomes. During the meeting, each STROBE item was discussed to determine whether or not rewording was recommended, and whether additions were warranted. Anonymous voting was used to determine consensus. Six items required no modifications or additions.

ANIMALS 116 aged guide dogs. PROCEDURES Dogs underwent a clinical geriatric assessment (CGA) and were followed to either time of death or the study cutoff date. A 5-component clinical definition of a frailty phenotype was derived from clinical items included in a geriatric health evaluation scoresheet completed by veterinarians during the CGA. Univariate (via Kaplan-Meier curves) and multivariate (via Cox proportional hazards models) survival analyses were used to investigate associations of the 5 CGA components with time to death. RESULTS 76 dogs died, and the median time from CGA to death was 4.4 years. Independent of age at the time of CGA, dogs that had ≥ 2 of the 5 components (n = 10) were more likely to die during the follow-up period, compared with those that had 1 or no components (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.9 [95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 10.9]). After further adjustments for subclinical or clinical diseases and routine biomarkers, the adjusted hazard ratio remained significant. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated that signs of frailty appeared to be a risk factor for death in dogs. The concept of frailty in dogs requires further development. IMPACT FOR HUMAN MEDICINE The concept of frailty, as defined for humans, seems transposable to dogs. Given that they share humans’ environments and develop several age-related diseases similar to those in humans, dogs may be useful for the study of environmental or age-related risk factors for frailty in humans. © 2016, American Veterinary Medical Association.

Hypothesis/Objectives: To determine the prevalence and risk factors of infection with enteropathogens and zoonotic Giardia strains in dogs attending dog parks in Northern California and to compare results of fecal flotation procedures performed at a commercial and university parasitology laboratory. Animals: Three-hundred dogs attending 3 regional dog parks in Northern California. Methods: Prospective study. Fresh fecal specimens were collected from all dogs, scored for consistency, and owners completed a questionnaire. Specimens were analyzed by fecal centrifugation flotation, DFA, and PCR for detection of 11 enteropathogens. Giardia genotyping was performed for assemblage determination. Results: Enteropathogens were detected in 114/300 dogs (38%), of which 62 (54%) did not have diarrhea. Frequency of dog park attendance correlated significantly with fecal consistency (P =.0039), but did not correlate with enteropathogen detection. Twenty-seven dogs (9%) were infected with Giardia, and genotyping revealed nonzoonotic assemblages C and D. The frequency of Giardia detection on fecal flotation was significantly lower at the commercial laboratory versus the university laboratory (P =.013), and PCR for Giardia was negative in 11/27 dogs (41%) that were positive on fecal flotation or DFA. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Enteropathogens were commonly detected in dogs frequenting dog parks, and infection with Giardia correlated with fecal consistency. PCR detection of Giardia had limited diagnostic utility, and detection of Giardia cysts by microscopic technique can vary among laboratories. Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

In most cats, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of <160 mmHg is achieved in response to amlodipine besylate at either 0.625 or 1.25 mg q24h. The individual cat factors determining dose requirement dose have not been explored. Aims: To determine whether individual cat factors influence the dose of amlodipine required to achieve adequate blood pressure control and to determine whether factors other than the prescribed dose of drug alter the achieved plasma amlodipine concentrations. Methods: Fifty-nine hypertensive cats that required 0.625 mg (A) and 41 cats that required 1.25 mg (B) amlodipine to reach a target SBP of <160 mmHg were identified, and plasma amlodipine concentrations were determined. Comparisons were made between groups, and multivariable linear regression models were performed to investigate predictors of antihypertensive response. Results: Cats that required a greater dose of amlodipine had significantly higher SBP at diagnosis of hypertension (A: (median [25th, 75th percentile]) 182 [175,192] mmHg; B: 207 [194,217] mmHg, P <.001), but comparable blood pressure was achieved after treatment. Plasma amlodipine concentrations were directly related to the dose of amlodipine administered. At diagnosis, cats in group B had significantly lower plasma potassium concentration (A: 4.1 [3.8,4.5]; B: 3.8 [3.6,4.2] mEq/L, P <.01). Weight did not differ between groups. The decrease in SBP was directly and independently associated with the SBP at diagnosis and the plasma amlodipine concentration. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Cats with higher blood pressure at diagnosis might require a greater dose of amlodipine to control their blood pressure adequately. Differences in amlodipine pharmacokinetics between cats do not seem to play a role in the antihypertensive response. Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Hypothesis: Feeding a moderately protein- and phosphate-restricted diet decreases PTH and FGF-23 in healthy older cats and thereby slows progression to azotemic CKD. Animals: A total of 54 healthy, client-owned cats (≥ 9 years). Methods: Prospective double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial. Cats were assigned to test diet (protein 76 g/Mcal and phosphate 1.6 g/Mcal) or control diet (protein 86 g/Mcal and phosphate 2.6 g/Mcal) and monitored for 18 months. Changes in variables over time and effect of diet were assessed by linear mixed models. Results: A total of 26 cats ate test diet and 28 cats ate control diet. There was a significant effect of diet on urinary fractional excretion of phosphate (P = 0.045), plasma PTH (P = 0.005), and ionized calcium concentrations (P = 0.018), but not plasma phosphate, FGF-23, or creatinine concentrations. Plasma PTH concentrations did not significantly change in cats fed the test diet (P = 0.62) but increased over time in cats fed the control diet (P = 0.001). There was no significant treatment effect of the test diet on development of azotemic CKD (3 of 26 (12%) test versus 3 of 28 (11%) control, odds ratio 1.09 (95% CI 0.13–8.94), P = 0.92). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Feeding a moderately protein- and phosphate-restricted diet has effects on calcium-phosphate homeostasis in healthy older cats and is well tolerated.

Serum cystatin C concentrations (sCysC) might be less influenced by changes in body muscle mass and so better indicate the presence of concurrent chronic kidney disease (CKD) in hyperthyroidism.HYPOTHESES: sCysC will be higher in hyperthyroid cats that develop azotemia compared with hyperthyroid cats that remain nonazotemic after treatment; sCysC will be higher in nonhyperthyroid cats with azotemic CKD than healthy older cats and, sCysC will decrease after treatment of hyperthyroidism.ANIMALS: Ninety-one cats treated in first opinion practice.METHODS: Case-control study. sCysC were compared between hyperthyroid cats which developed azotemia within 4 months of successful treatment of hyperthyroidism (pre-azotemic group) and hyperthyroid cats which remained nonazotemic after treatment (nonazotemic group), and between nonhyperthyroid cats with azotemic CKD and healthy older cats. sCysC were also compared between hyperthyroid cats before treatment and at time of establishment of euthyroidism. Data are presented as median [25th, 75th percentile].RESULTS: Baseline sCysC were not different between the pre-azotemic and nonazotemic groups (1.9 [1.4, 2.3] mg/L versus 1.5 [1.1, 2.2] mg/L, respectively; P = .22). sCysC in nonhyperthyroid cats with azotemic CKD and healthy older cats were not significantly different (1.5 [1.0, 1.9] mg/L versus 1.2 [0.8, 1.4] mg/L, respectively; P = .16). sCysC did not change significantly after treatment of hyperthyroidism (pretreatment 1.8 [1.2, 2.3] mg/L, after treatment 1.6 [1.1, 2.4] mg/L; P = .82).CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: sCysC do not appear to be a reliable marker of renal function in hyperthyroid cats.

But how should veterinarians reply? Influence on clients' decision-making may or may not be acceptable-depending on one's attitude to principles such as 'paternalism', 'respect for autonomy' and 'shared decision-making'. This study takes as a starting point a situation where the animal is chronically ill, or aged, with potentially reduced animal welfare and client quality of life, and thus where clients need to consider treatment options or euthanasia. It is assumed throughout that both veterinarians and clients have the animals' best interest at heart. The purpose of the study was to explore the challenges these situations hold and to investigate how clients experience veterinary influence. A second aim was to reflect on the ethical implications of the role of veterinarians in these situations. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 dog owners considering treatment or euthanasia of their chronically ill or aged dogs. Results: Challenges relating to the dog and to the client were identified. Some situations left the interviewees hesitant, e.g. if lacking a clear cut-off point, the dog appeared normal, the interviewee felt uncertain about treatments or animal welfare, or experienced conflicting concerns. Some interviewees found that veterinarians could influence their decisions. Such influence was received in different ways by the interviewees. Some interviewees wanted active involvement of the veterinarian in the decision-making process, and this may challenge a veterinarian's wish to respect client autonomy. Conclusions: Different preferences are likely to exist amongst both veterinarians and clients about veterinary involvement in clients' decision-making, and such preferences may vary according to the situation. It is suggested, that one way to handle this challenge is to include respect for client preference on veterinary involvement under a wider understanding of respect for autonomy, and to apply models of shared decision-making to veterinary practice. In any case there is a need to further explore the challenges these situations raise, and for the veterinary profession to engage in more formal and structured deliberation over the role of veterinarians in relation to clients' decision-making. © 2016 Christiansen et al.","Animal welfare; Autonomy; Companion animals; Dogs; Euthanasia; Human-animal bond; Informed consent; Paternalism; Shared decision-making; Veterinary ethics"

Hypothesis: The scoring system previously developed for outcome prediction will accurately predict outcome in a validation cohort of dogs with AKI managed with hemodialysis. Animals: One hundred fifteen client-owned dogs with AKI. Methods: Medical records of dogs with AKI treated by hemodialysis between 2011 and 2015 were reviewed. Dogs were included only if all variables required to calculate the final predictive score were available, and the 30-day outcome was known. A predictive score for 3 models was calculated for each dog. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of the final predictive score with each model's outcome. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses were performed to determine sensitivity and specificity for each model based on previously established cut-off values. Results: Higher scores for each model were associated with decreased survival probability (P < .001). Based on previously established cut-off values, 3 models (models A, B, C) were associated with sensitivities/specificities of 73/75%, 71/80%, and 75/86%, respectively, and correctly classified 74-80% of the dogs. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: All models were simple to apply and allowed outcome prediction that closely corresponded with actual outcome in an independent cohort. As expected, accuracies were slightly lower compared with those from the previously reported cohort used initially to develop the models. © 2016 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Acute renal failure; Hemodialysis; Outcome; Prediction; Survival; Urinary tract"

However, little is known about working relationships between animal shelters and veterinarians. The aims of this survey were to characterize working relationships that shelter personnel have and want with veterinarians, identify opinions that shelter managers have regarding the veterinarians they work with, and determine areas for relationship growth between veterinarians and shelter managers. An electronic survey was distributed to 1373 managers of North American animal shelters; 536 (39.0%) responded.Almost all shelters had some veterinary relationship, and most had regular relationships with veterinarians. The proportion of shelters that used local clinics (73.9%) was significantly higher than the proportion that retained on-site paid veterinarians (48.5%). The proportion of respondents who did not have but wanted a paid on-site veterinarian (42%) was significantly higher than the proportion of respondents who did not use local clinics but wanted to (7.9%). These data suggest shelter managers valued veterinary relationships, and wished to expand on-site veterinary services. Almost all shelters in this study provided some veterinary care, and all respondents identified at least one common infectious disease, which, for most, had a substantial negative impact on shelter successes. Respondents indicated that the most important roles and greatest expertise of veterinarians were related to surgery, diagnosis and treatment of individual animals. Education of both veterinarians and shelter managers may help ensure that shelters benefit from the full range of services veterinarians can provide, including expertise in disease prevention and animal behavior. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Animal shelter; Health services; Shelter management; Shelter medicine; Veterinary services"

Hypothesis/objectives: Evaluation of clinical and questionnaire data will identify risk factors for development of azotemic CKD in cats. Animals: One hundred and forty-eight client-owned geriatric (>9 years) cats. Methods: Cats were recruited into the study and followed longitudinally for a variable time. Owners were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their pet at enrollment. Additional data regarding dental disease were obtained when available by development of a dental categorization system. Variables were explored in univariable and multivariable Cox regression models. Results: In the final multivariable Cox regression model, annual/frequent vaccination (P value, .003; hazard ratio, 5.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.83-17.64), moderate dental disease (P value, .008; hazard ratio, 13.83; 95% confidence interval, 2.01-94.99), and severe dental disease (P value, .001; hazard ratio, 35.35; 95% confidence interval, 4.31-289.73) predicted development of azotemic CKD.

Procedure: Five needle gauges (22G, 23G, 25G, 27G, and 30G) were examined. For each gauge, volume of drop delivered was determined for standard sharp beveled tip, blunt tip, and after breaking off of the sharp needle from the hub. Vertical and horizontal orientation of the needle was tested for effect on drop volume for 22-G and 30-G sharp beveled needles. Results: Mean drop volume was affected by needle gauge, needle orientation, and whether the needle had been broken off from its hub. Mean drop volume scaled directly with needle diameter with drop volumes of 25.0 μL (±20.2) and 83.9 μL (±16.5) being found for 30-gauge and 22-gauge needles, respectively. Intermediate gauges (27, 25, 23G) yielded intermediate drop volumes. Blunt needles tended to produce larger drop volumes compared to sharp beveled needles, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Breaking off of the needle from the hub produced substantially larger drop volumes with little difference being found between needle gauges. Average volumes of 1 drop from a 22-G vertical, 22-G horizontal, 30-G vertical, and 30-G horizontal sharp beveled needle were 20.2, 9.1, 10.1, and 3.3 μL, respectively.

Hypothesis/Objectives: To describe the signalment, clinicopathologic data, radiographic and ultrasonographic findings, antimicrobial susceptibility, outcome, and pathologic lesions associated with Klebsiella spp. pneumonia in horses. Animals: Forty-six horses from which Klebsiella spp. was isolated from the lower respiratory tract. Methods: Retrospective study. Medical records from 1993 to 2013 at the William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of California, Davis were reviewed. Exact logistic regression was performed to determine if any variables were associated with survival to hospital discharge. Results: Survival in horses <1 year old was 73%. Overall survival in adults was 63%. For adults in which Klebsiella pneumoniae was the primary isolate, survival was 52%. Mechanical ventilation preceded development of pneumonia in 11 horses. Complications occurred in 25/46 horses, with thrombophlebitis and laminitis occurring most frequently. Multi-drug resistance was found in 47% of bacterial isolates. Variables that significantly impacted survival included hemorrhagic nasal discharge, laminitis, and thoracic radiographs with a sharp demarcation between marked caudal pulmonary alveolar infiltration and more normal-appearing caudodorsal lung. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Klebsiella spp. should be considered as a differential diagnosis for horses presenting with hemorrhagic pneumonia and for horses developing pneumonia after mechanical ventilation. Multi-drug resistance is common.

Objectives: To determine the effects of 2 inhalation anesthetics on the EEG of healthy horses. Animals: Six healthy horses. Methods: Prospective study. After the sole administration of one of either isoflurane or halothane at 1.2, 1.4, and 1.6 times the minimum alveolar concentration, EEG was recorded during controlled ventilation, spontaneous ventilation, and nerve stimulation. Results: Burst suppression was observed with isoflurane, along with EEG events that resembled epileptiform discharges. Halothane results were variable between horses, with epileptiform-like discharges and bursts of theta, alpha, and beta recorded intermittently. One horse died and 2 were euthanized as the result of anesthesia-related complications. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The results of this study indicate that the effects of halothane and isoflurane on EEG activity in the normal horse can be quite variable, even when used in the absence of other drugs. It is recommended that equine EEG be performed without the use of these inhalation anesthetics and that general anesthesia be induced and maintained by other contemporary means. © 2016 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Epilepsy; Equine; Halothane; Isoflurane; Seizures"

Hypothesis/Objectives: Serum Spec cPL, lipase activity, and TLI concentrations will increase secondary to decreased kidney function. Animals: Five purpose-bred dogs. Methods: Experimental prospective study. Gentamicin was used to induce AKI in 5 purpose-bred dogs. Serum samples were collected for measurement of creatinine, Spec cPL, lipase activity and TLI over 60 days, during both induction of, and recovery from, AKI.

Hypothesis/Objectives: To develop and validate a tool for assessment of owner-perceived QoL in cats (CatQoL) and to use this tool to compare QoL between healthy cats and those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Animals/Subjects: Total of 204 owners of young healthy cats (YH, n = 99; <9 years), older healthy cats (OH, n = 35), and cats diagnosed with CKD (CKD, n = 70) completed the CatQoL. Methods: Discussions with a focus group and 2 pilot surveys informed design of 16 QoL questions grouped into 4 domains. Each item scored according to frequency and importance, and item-weighted-impact-scores were calculated. The validity of the tool was assessed using principal components analysis and Cronbach's α.

Aim: To identify the prevalence of AF in nonsmall breed dogs with CHF because of MMVD and to characterize the impact of AF on survival outcome. Animal: Sixty-four client-owned dogs (>15 kg) with MMVD and CHF. Methods: Retrospective review of medical records for dogs weighing >15 kg with MMVD treated for CHF. Results: Thirty-three dogs presented with AF or developed AF during follow-up examinations, and 31 dogs were free of AF until cardiac-related death. For dogs with AF, median survival time (MST) was 142 days (range: 9-478) while dogs without AF lived 234 days (range: 13-879 days). AF increased risk of cardiac-related death (HR = 2.544; 95% CI = 1.41-4.59; P =.0019) when compared to dogs without AF. MST was significantly prolonged for dogs with AF whose rates were adequately controlled (<160 bpm; 171 days; n = 13) when compared to dogs that failed to respond to negative chronotropic agents (61 days; n = 20; P =.032). The administration of combination treatment (diltiazem and digoxin) significantly decreased median HR to 144 bpm (range: 84-218 bpm) in dogs with AF and significantly prolonged MST (diltiazem+digoxin: 130 days versus diltiazem: 35 days, P =.0241) when compared to diltiazem alone.

Objective: To determine the effects of isoflurane and halothane, administered as single agents at multiple levels, on the EEG and quantitative EEG (qEEG) of normal horses. Animals: Six healthy horses. Methods: Prospective study. Digital EEG with video and quantitative EEG (qEEG) were recorded after the administration of one of the 2 anesthetics, isoflurane or halothane, at 3 alveolar doses (1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 MAC). Segments of EEG during controlled ventilation (CV), spontaneous ventilation (SV), and with peroneal nerve stimulation (ST) at each MAC multiple for each anesthetic were selected, analyzed, and compared. Multiple non-EEG measurements were also recorded. Results: Specific raw EEG findings were indicative of changes in the depth of anesthesia. However, there was considerable variability in EEG between horses at identical MAC multiples/conditions and within individual horses over segments of a given epoch. Statistical significance for qEEG variables differed between anesthetics with bispectral index (BIS) CV MAC and 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95) SV MAC differences in isoflurane only and median frequency (MED) differences in SV MAC with halothane only.

The objective of this study was to investigate the level of agreement between vets (both neurology specialists and non-specialists) on the description and classification of videos depicting paroxysmal events, without knowing any results of diagnostic workup. An online questionnaire study was conducted, where participants watched 100 videos of dogs and cats exhibiting paroxysmal events and answered questions regarding: epileptic seizure presence (yes/no), seizure type, consciousness status, and the presence of motor, autonomic and neurobehavioural signs. Agreement statistics (percentage agreement and kappa) calculated for each variable, with prevalence indices calculated to aid their interpretation. Results: Only a fair level of agreement (k = 0.40) was found for epileptic seizure presence. Overall agreement of seizure type was moderate (k = 0.44), with primary generalised seizures showing the highest level of agreement (k = 0.60), and focal the lowest (k =0.31). Fair agreement was found for consciousness status and the presence of autonomic signs (k = 0.21-0.40), but poor agreement for neurobehavioral signs (k = 0.16). Agreement for motor signs ranged from poor (k = ≤ 0.20) to moderate (k = 0.41-0.60). Differences between specialists and non-specialists were identified.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is regarded as an important diagnostic test to reach the diagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy. However, given that the diagnosis requires the exclusion of other differentials for seizures, the parameters for MRI examination should allow the detection of subtle lesions which may not be obvious with existing techniques. In addition, there are several differentials for idiopathic epilepsy in humans, for example some focal cortical dysplasias, which may only apparent with special sequences, imaging planes and/or particular techniques used in performing the MRI scan. As a result, there is a need to standardize MRI examination in veterinary patients with techniques that reliably diagnose subtle lesions, identify post-seizure changes, and which will allow for future identification of underlying causes of seizures not yet apparent in the veterinary literature. There is a need for a standardized veterinary epilepsy-specific MRI protocol which will facilitate more detailed examination of areas susceptible to generating and perpetuating seizures, is cost efficient, simple to perform and can be adapted for both low and high field scanners. Standardisation of imaging will improve clinical communication and uniformity of case definition between research studies.

This has led to an unfortunate situation where different veterinary publications and textbook chapters on epilepsy merely reflect individual author preferences with respect to terminology, which can be confusing to the readers and influence the definition and diagnosis of epilepsy in first line practice and research studies. In this document the International Veterinary Epilepsy Task Force (IVETF) discusses current understanding of canine epilepsy and presents our 2015 proposal for terminology and classification of epilepsy and epileptic seizures. We propose a classification system which reflects new thoughts from the human ILAE but also roots in former well accepted terminology. We think that this classification system can be used by all stakeholders. © 2015 Berendt et al.","Classification; Dog; Epilepsy; Seizures; Semiology"

Nevertheless, the same questions remain, which include, 1) when to start treatment, 2) which drug is best used initially, 3) which adjunctive AED can be advised if treatment with the initial drug is unsatisfactory, and 4) when treatment changes should be considered. In this consensus proposal, an overview is given on the aim of AED treatment, when to start long-term treatment in canine epilepsy and which veterinary AEDs are currently in use for dogs. The consensus proposal for drug treatment protocols, 1) is based on current published evidence-based literature, 2) considers the current legal framework of the cascade regulation for the prescription of veterinary drugs in Europe, and 3) reflects the authors' experience. With this paper it is aimed to provide a consensus for the management of canine idiopathic epilepsy.

The aim of this consensus proposal is to improve consistency in the diagnosis of epilepsy in the clinical and research settings. The diagnostic approach to the patient presenting with a history of suspected epileptic seizures incorporates two fundamental steps: to establish if the events the animal is demonstrating truly represent epileptic seizures and if so, to identify their underlying cause. Differentiation of epileptic seizures from other non-epileptic episodic paroxysmal events can be challenging. Criteria that can be used to make this differentiation are presented in detail and discussed. Criteria for the diagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy (IE) are described in a three-tier system. Tier I confidence level for the diagnosis of IE is based on a history of two or more unprovoked epileptic seizures occurring at least 24 h apart, age at epileptic seizure onset of between six months and six years, unremarkable inter-ictal physical and neurological examination, and no significant abnormalities on minimum data base blood tests and urinalysis. Tier II confidence level for the diagnosis of IE is based on the factors listed in tier I and unremarkable fasting and post-prandial bile acids, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (based on an epilepsy-specific brain MRI protocol) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Tier III confidence level for the diagnosis of IE is based on the factors listed in tier I and II and identification of electroencephalographic abnormalities characteristic for seizure disorders. The authors recommend performing MRI of the brain and routine CSF analysis, after exclusion of reactive seizures, in dogs with age at epileptic seizure onset <6 months or >6 years, inter-ictal neurological abnormalities consistent with intracranial neurolocalisation, status epilepticus or cluster seizure at epileptic seizure onset, or a previous presumptive diagnosis of IE and drug-resistance with a single antiepileptic drug titrated to the highest tolerable dose. This consensus article represents the basis for a more standardised diagnostic approach to the seizure patient. These recommendations will evolve over time with advances in neuroimaging, electroencephalography, and molecular genetics of canine epilepsy. © 2015 De Risio et al.","Diagnosis; Dog; Epilepsy; Idiopathic epilepsy; Seizure"

To inform updating of the curriculum for residents of the European College of Veterinary Neurology (ECVN) job analysis was used. Defining job competencies of diploma holders in veterinary neurology can be used as references for curriculum design of resident training. With the support of the diplomates of the ECVN and the members of the European Society of Veterinary Neurology (ESVN) a mixed-method research, including a qualitative search of objectives and quantitative ranking with 149 Likert scale questions and 48 free text questions in 9 categories in a survey was conducted. In addition, opinions of different groups were subjected to statistical analysis and the result compared. Results: A return rate of 62% (n = 213/341) was achieved. Of the competencies identified by the Delphi process, 75% objectives were expected to attain expert level; 24% attain advanced level; 1% entry level. In addition, the exercise described the 11 highly ranked competencies, the 3 most frequently seen diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems and the most frequently used immunosuppressive, antiepileptic and chemotherapeutic drugs. Conclusion: The outcomes of this ""Delphi job analysis"" provide a powerful tool to align the curriculum for ECVN resident training and can be adapted to the required job competencies, based on expectations. The expectation is that for majority of these competencies diplomates should attain an expert level. Besides knowledge and clinical skills, residents and diplomates are expected to demonstrate high standards in teaching and communication.

The medical profession has adopted the term ""cardiorenal syndrome"" (CRS) to describe the pathophysiological relationship between the kidney and heart in disease. CRS has yet to be formally defined and described by the veterinary profession and its existence and importance in dogs and cats warrant investigation. The CRS Consensus Group, comprising nine veterinary cardiologists and seven nephrologists from Europe and North America, sought to achieve consensus around the definition, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of dogs and cats with ""cardiovascular-renal disorders"" (CvRD). To this end, the Delphi formal methodology for defining/building consensus and defining guidelines was utilised. METHODS: Following a literature review, 13 candidate statements regarding CvRD in dogs and cats were tested for consensus, using a modified Delphi method. As a new area of interest, well-designed studies, specific to CRS/CvRD, are lacking, particularly in dogs and cats. Hence, while scientific justification of all the recommendations was sought and used when available, recommendations were largely reliant on theory, expert opinion, small clinical studies and extrapolation from data derived from other species. RESULTS: Of the 13 statements, 11 achieved consensus and 2 did not. The modified Delphi approach worked well to achieve consensus in an objective manner and to develop initial guidelines for CvRD. DISCUSSION: The resultant manuscript describes consensus statements for the definition, classification, diagnosis and management strategies for veterinary patients with CvRD, with an emphasis on the pathological interplay between the two organ systems. By formulating consensus statements regarding CvRD in veterinary medicine, the authors hope to stimulate interest in and advancement of the understanding and management of CvRD in dogs and cats. The use of a formalised method for consensus and guideline development should be considered for other topics in veterinary medicine. © 2015 British Small Animal Veterinary Association.",

Design-Randomized prospective parallel-group experiment. Population-25 students completing the second year of their veterinary curriculum. Procedures-Students were randomly assigned to 2 groups to receive 14 hours of specific training in either open ovariectomy (n = 13) or laparoscopic ovariectomy (12). Confidence, basic surgical skills, and basic laparoscopic skills were evaluated before and after training, prior to live surgical procedures. Results-Scores related to basic surgical skills were high in both groups and did not improve with either training program. Before live animal surgeries, student confidence and basic laparoscopic skills improved after training in laparoscopic ovariectomy and were higher than after training in open ovariectomy. Surgery time was higher for the students who received training in laparoscopic ovariectomy (129 minutes; range, 84 to 143 minutes), compared with students who received training in open ovariectomy (80 minutes; range, 62 to 117 minutes). On a 55-point scoring system, ovariectomy scores were similar between students who received training in open ovariectomy (34.5; range, 16.5 to 45) and students who received training in laparoscopic ovariectomy (34.5; range, 25 to 44.5). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The training programs were effective in improving student confidence and skills in laparoscopic ovariectomy. Results of this study suggested that veterinary medical students, with assistance from an instructor, may be taught to perform laparoscopic ovariectomies with performance equivalent to that for students performing open ovariectomies. © 2015, American Veterinary Medical Association.

Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Veterinary teaching hospital. Animals: One hundred twenty-six client-owned dogs diagnosed with heatstroke. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify clinicopathologic variables, available in the first 24 hours of hospitalization, which were associated with outcome (P ≤ 0.1). These were subjected to further analyses. In Model A, continuous variables were divided into quartiles, and logistic regression was performed to yield quartile-specific odds ratios (ORs) for the outcome. Model A was developed, assigning weighted values to each quartile, based on its corresponding OR for the outcome. An individual predictive score was calculated for each dog by summating all weighted values. Model B was a multivariable logistic regression model. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to assess models' performance and to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and optimal cutoff points. The overall mortality rate was 53%. The total predictive score (Model A) was negatively and significantly (P < 0.001) associated with probability of survival. The areas under the ROC curve for Models A and B were 0.92 and 0.86, respectively. The optimal cutoff score for Model A was 35.0, corresponding to sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 86%, correctly classifying 90% of the cases. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: The proposed models are applicable, allowing objective assessment of the severity and prognosis of heatstroke in dogs; however, they should be validated further in an independent cohort, and used cautiously for assessment of individual cases. © Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2015.","Canine; Hyperthermia; Illness severity score; Morbidity; Mortality"

Few studies have assessed sequential changes in indices of kidney function in dogs with naturally occurring AKI. Objective: To document sequential changes of conventional indices of renal function, to better define the course of AKI, and to identify a candidate marker for recovery. Animals: Ten dogs with AKI. Methods: Dogs were prospectively enrolled and divided into surviving and nonsurviving dogs. Urine production was measured with a closed system for 7 days. One and 24-hour urinary clearances were performed daily to estimate solute excretion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Solute excretion was calculated as an excretion ratio (ER) and fractional clearance (FC) based on both the 1- and 24-hour urine collections. Results: Four dogs survived and 6 died. At presentation, GFR was not significantly different between the outcome groups, but significantly (P = .03) increased over time in the surviving, but not in the nonsurviving dogs. Fractional clearance of Na decreased significantly over time (20.2-9.4%, P < .0001) in the surviving, but not in the nonsurviving dogs. The ER and FC of solutes were highly correlated (r, 0.70-0.95). Conclusion and Clinical Impact: Excretion ratio might be used in the clinical setting as a surrogate marker to follow trends in solute excretion. Increased GFR, urine production, and decreased FC of Na were markers of renal recovery. The FC of Na is a simple, noninvasive, and cost-effective method that can be used to evaluate recovery of renal function. © 2015 The Authors.

Hypothesis/Objectives: To evaluate trends in the in vitro activities of 20 antimicrobials against equine Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis isolates from 1996 to 2012 and to determine if a relationship exists between the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and location of the abscess. Animals: Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis isolates from 196 horses with naturally occurring disease. Methods: Retrospective and cross-sectional design. Medical records were reviewed to obtain clinical and MIC data. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by the microdilution technique. The MIC results over 3 periods were compared (1996-2001, 2002-2006, 2007-2012). Results: The MIC90 values for clinically relevant antimicrobials were as follows: chloramphenicol ≤4 μg/mL, enrofloxacin ≤0.25 μg/mL, gentamicin ≤1 μg/mL, penicillin =0.25 μg/mL, rifampin ≤1 μg/mL, tetracycline ≤2 μg/mL, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMS) ≤0.5 μg/mL, ceftiofur =2 μg/mL, and doxycycline ≤2 μg/mL. There were no significant changes in MIC results over the study period. There was no relationship between MIC patterns and abscess location. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The MIC50 and MIC90 values of antimicrobials evaluated in this study for equine isolates of C. pseudotuberculosis did not vary over time.

Risk factors often have been considered in isolation and have not always taken into account additional information provided by the history and physical examination (PE). Hypothesis/Objectives: Data obtained from history and PE of dogs with DMVD provide prognostic information and can be used for risk stratification. Animals: Client-owned dogs (n = 244) with DMVD recruited from first opinion practice. Methods: Prospective longitudinal follow-up of dogs with DMVD. History and PE data were obtained at 6-month intervals and analyzed with time-dependent Cox models to derive relative risk of cardiac death. Independent hazard ratios were used to derive a clinical severity score (CSS), the prognostic value of which was evaluated by analyzing the median survival times for different risk groups and ROC analysis. Analysis of the progression of CSS over time also was undertaken. Results: History of cough, exercise intolerance, decreased appetite, breathlessness (difficulty breathing) and syncope with PE findings of heart murmur intensity louder than III/VI and absence of respiratory sinus arrhythmia were independently associated with outcome and allowed development of the CSS. Clinical severity score distinguished groups of dogs with significantly different outcomes. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Routinely obtained clinical findings allow risk stratification of dogs with DMVD.

Three hormonally based patterns of seizure exacerbation have been determined. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there is an association between onset of seizures and the estrous cycle in intact bitches with presumptive idiopathic epilepsy and whether a pattern to the onset of seizures could be recognized. Animals: Forty-five intact female dogs from a hospital population with a presumptive diagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy. Methods: In a retrospective study, the database of a small animal hospital in Sweden was searched for medical records of intact female dogs diagnosed with epilepsy or seizures. The stage of the estrous cycle as reported either by the owner or the veterinarian at the time of the first seizure was noted. Results: Of the 45 dogs with idiopathic epilepsy, 17 (38%) had their first seizure when in heat and six dogs (13%) had their first seizure 1-3 months after heat. Nine dogs (20%) had seizures reoccurring in relation to their estrous cycle. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: These findings suggest an association between estrus and onset of seizures in intact bitches with presumptive idiopathic epilepsy.

Hypothesis/Objectives: The primary objective was to develop a method of determining ECFV from iohexol clearance in cats and evaluate agreement with that determined using bromide dilution. Additional objectives were to compare ECFV between azotemic and nonazotemic cats and evaluate appropriate methods of standardizing ECFV. Animals: Client-owned cats with varying renal function. Methods: Validation of ECFV determined from slope-intercept iohexol clearance was performed in 18 healthy nonazotemic cats. ECFV was then determined using the validated method and bromide dilution and agreement assessed. Appropriateness of standardization to body weight (BW) and body surface area (BSA) was evaluated. Results: Extracellular fluid volume determined from slope-intercept iohexol clearance and bromide dilution was 0.84 ± 0.32 L and 0.85 ± 0.19 L (mean ± SD), respectively. There were wide limits of agreement between the methods (-0.58 to 0.54 L) and therefore, agreement was considered to be poor. ECFV did not differ significantly between azotemic and nonazotemic cats (P = .177). BSA was found to be the best method for standardizing ECFV measurement in cats. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: This study developed a method for determining ECFV from slope-intercept iohexol clearance which provides simultaneous assessment of renal function and an estimate of ECFV. ECFV does not differ between azotemic and nonazotemic cats, which suggests fluid volume loss or overload is not an important clinical feature in cats with mild chronic kidney disease. © 2014 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Bromide; Glomerular filtration rate; Iohexol; Kidney disease; Renal"

Animals: Fifteen dogs with sepsis requiring laparotomy (study dogs) and 10 dogs undergoing surgery for intervertebral disc disease (control dogs). Objective: To determine whether NGAL increases in dogs with sepsis undergoing emergency laparotomy and whether it is correlated with development of AKI and survival. Methods: Longitudinal study conducted at a referral teaching hospital. Serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (sNGAL), urinary NGAL normalized to urinary creatinine concentration (UNCR), and serum creatinine concentration were measured at 4 time points (admission, after anesthesia, and 24 and 48 hours postsurgery). Development of AKI (increase in serum creatinine concentration of 0.3 mg/dL) and in-hospital mortality were recorded. Linear mixed-model analysis was employed to assess differences between groups over time. Mann-Whitney U-test was performed for comparison of continuous variables between groups and Chi square or Fisher's exact tests were used to assess correlation between discrete data. Results: Serum NGAL and UNCR were significantly higher in study dogs across all time points (P = .007 and P < .001, respectively) compared with controls. Urinary NGAL normalized to creatinine in the study group was not significantly different between survivors (n = 12) and nonsurvivors (n = 3). Dogs that received hydroxyethyl starch had significantly higher UNCR across all time points (P = .04) than those that did not. Discussion-Conclusion: Serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and UNCR are increased in dogs with sepsis requiring emergency laparotomy.

Decreased availability of phosphorus has been proposed to reduce adenosine triphosphate synthesis of erythrocytes and thereby reduce osmotic resistance of these cells. Hypothesis/Objectives: To study the effect of phosphorus depletion on the phosphate concentration ([Pi]) in plasma and erythrocytes and the osmotic resistance of erythrocytes and to determine the association between plasma [Pi] and erythrocyte [Pi]. Animals: Ten healthy midlactating dairy cows in their 3rd to 5th lactation. Methods: Prospective study. Dietary phosphorus depletion for 5 weeks followed by phosphorus supplementation. Plasma and erythrocyte [Pi] and erythrocyte osmotic resistance were measured. Four cows underwent continuous dextrose infusion at the end of phosphate depletion to exacerbate hypophosphatemia. Results: Dietary P depletion resulted in a marked decline of the plasma [Pi] from 4.1 ± 1.0 mg/dL to a nadir of 1.7 ± 0,5 mg/dL, but did not alter erythrocyte [Pi] or osmotic resistance. Similarly, dextrose infusion induced a decline of the plasma [Pi] from 2.4 ± 0.5 mg/dL to 1.5 ± 0.5 mg/dL, but had no effect on erythrocyte [Pi] or osmotic resistance. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: In cattle, marked hypophosphatemia induced by dietary P depletion was neither associated with a decline in erythrocyte [Pi] nor with decreased osmotic resistance of erythrocytes. Phosphorus depletion alone is therefore unlikely to cause intravascular hemolysis and the plasma [Pi] is an unreliable index for the intracellular [Pi] of erythrocytes. © 2014 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Hemolysis; Hypophosphatemia; Osmotic resistance; Postparturient hemoglobinuria"

Hypothesis: Long-term treatment of cats with CKD using telmisartan decreases urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UP/C) similar to benazepril. Animals: Two-hundred and twenty-four client-owned adult cats with CKD. Methods: Prospective, multicenter, controlled, randomized, parallel group, blinded clinical trial with noninferiority design. Cats were allocated in a 1: 1 ratio to either telmisartan (1 mg/kg; n = 112) or benazepril (0.5-1.0 mg/kg; n = 112) PO q24 h. The primary endpoint was prospectively defined as the change in proteinuria (benazepril:telmisartan) based on a log transformed weighted average of UP/C change from baseline (AUC 0→t/t) as a percentage compared using a confidence interval (CI) approach. Changes of UP/C from baseline were assessed on all study days and corrected for multiple comparisons. Results: Telmisartan proved noninferior to benazepril in controlling proteinuria (CI, -0.035 to 0.268). At Day 180, UP/C compared to baseline in the telmisartan group was significantly lower (-0.05 ± 0.31; P = .016), whereas in the benazepril group the change (-0.02 ± 0.48) was not statistically significant (P = .136). Similar results were obtained at all assessment points with significant decrease in UP/C occurring with telmisartan but not benazepril. Conclusion and Clinical Importance: Both telmisartan and benazepril were well tolerated and safe.

The main purpose of this present study was to establish a practical workflow for performing 18F-FDG PET and hyperpolarized13C-pyruvate MRS imaging simultaneously for tumor tissue characterization and on a larger scale test its feasibility. In addition, we evaluated the correlation between 18F-FDG uptake and13C-lactate production. Methods: Ten dogs with biopsy-verified spontaneous malignant tumors were included for imaging. All dogs underwent a protocol of simultaneous 18F-FDG PET, anatomic MR, and hyperpolarized dynamic nuclear polarization with13C-pyruvate imaging. The data were acquired using a combined clinical PET/MR imaging scanner. Results: We found that combined 18F-FDG PET and13C-pyruvate MRS imaging was possible in a single session of approximately 2 h. A continuous workflow was obtained with the injection of 18F-FDG when the dogs was placed in the PET/MR scanner.13C-MRS dynamic acquisition demonstrated in an axial slab increased13C-lactate production in 9 of 10 dogs. For the 9 dogs, the13C-lactate was detected after a mean of 25 s (range, 17-33 s), with a mean to peak of13C-lactate at 49 s (range, 40-62 s).13C-pyruvate could be detected on average after 13 s (range, 5-26 s) and peaked on average after 25 s (range, 13-42 s). We noticed concordance of 18F-FDG uptake and production of13C-lactate in most, but not all, axial slices. Conclusion: In this study, we have shown in a series of dogs with cancer that hyperPET can easily be performed within 2 h. We showed mostly correspondence between13C-lactate production and 18F-FDG uptake and expect the combined modalities to reveal additional metabolic information to improve prognostic value and improve response monitoring.

Both are predictors of survival time in human patients, but these relationships have not previously been examined in the cat. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between plasma FGF-23 and PTH concentrations at diagnosis of CKD in cats with survival time and with disease progression over 12 months. Animals: 214 azotemic, client-owned cats (≥9 years). Methods: Retrospective study: Biochemical and urinary variables at diagnosis of azotemic CKD, including plasma FGF-23 and PTH concentrations were assessed as predictors of survival time (all-cause mortality) using Cox regression, and as predictors of CKD progression over 12 months using logistic regression. Results: In the final multivariable Cox regression model, survival was negatively associated with plasma creatinine (P = .002) and FGF-23 concentrations (P = .014), urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (P < .001) and age (P < .001). Survival was positively associated with PCV (P = .004). In the final multivariable logistic regression model, independent predictors of CKD progression included logFGF-23 and age. Neither plasma phosphate nor PTH was found to be an independent predictor of survival time or of CKD progression. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Plasma FGF-23 concentration is a novel prognostic indicator in cats with CKD, independent of other factors including plasma creatinine and phosphate concentrations. Further work is required to assess if FGF-23 contributes directly to CKD progression, but regardless these findings may make FGF-23 a useful biomarker for predicting poorer outcomes in cats with CKD. © 2015 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Feline; Parathyroid hormone; Phosphate; Progression"

Animals: Horses with bacterial pneumonia and fibrinous pleural effusion diagnosed by ultrasonography, that were treated with rTPA intrapleurally. Methods: Retrospective multicenter case series from 2007-2012. Signalment, history, clinical and laboratory evaluation, treatment, and outcome obtained from medical records. Regression analysis used to identify associations between treatments and outcomes. Results: Thirty three hemithoraces were treated in 25 horses, with 55 separate treatments. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (375-20,000 μg/hemithorax) was administered 1-4 times. Sonographically visible reduction in fibrin mat thickness, loculations, fluid depth, or some combination of these was seen in 32/49 (65%) treatments.

As such, predicting which patients will have good or poor treatment outcomes is imprecise, impeding patient management. In the present study, we use a naturally occurring animal model of pharmacoresistant epilepsy to investigate clinical risk factors associated with treatment outcome. Dogs with idiopathic epilepsy, for which no underlying cause was identified, were treated at a canine epilepsy clinic and monitored following discharge from a small animal referral hospital. Clinical data was gained via standardised owner questionnaires and longitudinal follow up data was gained via telephone interview with the dogs' owners. At follow up, 14% of treated dogs were in seizure-free remission. Dogs that did not achieve remission were more likely to be male, and to have previously experienced cluster seizures. Seizure frequency or the total number of seizures prior to treatment were not significant predictors of pharmacoresistance, demonstrating that seizure density, that is, the temporal pattern of seizure activity, is a more influential predictor of pharmacoresistance. These results are in line with clinical studies of human epilepsy, and experimental rodent models of epilepsy, that patients experiencing episodes of high seizure density (cluster seizures), not just a high seizure frequency pre-treatment, are at an increased risk of drug-refractoriness.

This RT-LAMP-LFD assay combines the efficient one-step isothermal amplification of CSF viral RNA and the simplicity of the LFD to read the results within two to five minutes. Seven genotypes (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 3.1), but not genotype 3.4, were successfully detected by the RT-LAMP-LFD assay, indicating that the method has a broad range of detection and can be applied in different geographical areas where CSFV strains belonging to these genotypes are present. The performance of this RT-LAMP-LFD assay was similar to that of the real-time RT-PCR. The analytical sensitivity was about 100. copies per reaction when testing two genotypes (1.1 and 2.3).

However, the relationship between platelet activation state and cardiovascular parameters associated with HCM is not well described. Objectives: To characterize platelet activation by flow cytometric evaluation of platelet P-selectin and semiquantitative Western blot analysis of soluble platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (sPECAM-1). Animals: Eight normal healthy cats (controls) owned by staff and students of the School of Veterinary Medicine and 36 cats from the UC Davis Feline HCM Research Laboratory were studied. Methods: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was used for all flow cytometry studies. Platelet surface CD41 and P-selectin expression were evaluated before and after ADP stimulation. sPECAM-1 expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis of platelet-poor plasma that had been stabilized with aprotinin. Standard echocardiographic studies were performed. Results: Resting platelets from cats with severe HCM had increased P-selectin expression compared to controls, and expressed higher surface density of P-selectin reflected by their increased mean fluorescence intensities (MFI). Stimulation with ADP also resulted in significantly increased P-selectin MFI of platelets from cats with severe HCM. Increased P-selectin expression and MFI correlated with the presence of a heart murmur and end-systolic cavity obliteration (ESCO). sPECAM-1 expression from cats with moderate and severe HCM was significantly increased above those of control cats.

The medical records of two veterinary referral institutions were searched for dogs diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy and treated with PB as monotherapy or polytherapy between March 2003 and September 2010. Sixteen dogs had PBIHA; the median age at diagnosis was 69.5 months. Phenobarbitone was administered at a median dose of 3 mg/kg twice a day for a median period of 100.5 days and the median serum phenobarbitone level was 19 μg/ml. Two dogs had neutropenia, three had anaemia and thrombocytopenia, two had anaemia and neutropenia; the remaining nine had pancytopenia. All dogs were referred for non-specific clinical signs. Phenobarbitone was discontinued after diagnosis, and the median time to resolution of PBIHA was 17 days. The prevalence and risk factors for PBIHA were evaluated from a questionnaire survey of referring practices to obtain more detailed follow-up on cases diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. The prevalence rate of PBIHA was 4.2%, and the condition occurred in dogs treated with standard therapeutic doses often within the first three months after starting treatment. Serial haematological evaluations should be therefore considered from the beginning of phenobarbitone therapy to allow early diagnosis and treatment of PBIHA.",

There are many reasons, which have to be considered as supporting factors for the spread of infectious diseases, such as the open borders of the European Union, allowing rather free movement of animals over a whole continent, the globalization, the released and accelerated international and national trade and animal transfer. Simultaneously, the emergence and re-emergence of new or already known pathogens is a various serious issue in veterinary and in human medicine. This scenario is clearly illustrated by the regular occurrence of transboundary animal diseases (TADs), such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), classical swine fever (CSF), African swine fever (ASF), among others. The recent occurrence of African swine fever in the Caucasus region and the spread afterwards to large territories of Russia clearly illustrates that our health authorities require a very strong preparedness, including prompt and powerful diagnosis, for the successful fight against the novel scenarios. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Two drugs have been licensed for cats in the last decade: methimazole and its pro-drug carbimazole. On the basis of current evidence and available tablet sizes, starting doses of 2·5 mg methimazole twice a day and 10 to 15 mg once a day for the sustained release formulation of carbimazole are recommended. These doses should then be titrated to effect in order to obtain circulating total thyroxine (TT4) concentrations in the lower half of the reference interval. Treated cases should be monitored for side-effects, especially during the first months of treatment. Some side-effects may require discontinuation of treatment. At each monitoring visit, clinical condition and quality of life should also be evaluated, with special attention to possible development of azotaemia, hypertension and iatrogenic hypothyroidism. When euthyroidism has been achieved, monitoring visits are recommended after 1 month, 3 months and biannually thereafter. Cats with pre-existing azotaemia have shorter survival times. However, development of mild azotaemia during the initial course of treatment, unless associated with hypothyroidism, does not appear to decrease survival time.

The effect of sex hormones on seizures is well documented in human medicine. Catamenial epilepsy is defined as an increase in frequency and severity of seizures during certain periods of the menstrual cycle. Oestradiol increases seizure activity and progesterone is believed to exhibit a protective effect. The role of androgens is controversial and there is a lack of research focusing on androgens and epilepsy. Indeed, little is known about the influence of sex hormones on epilepsy in dogs. Sterilisation is believed to improve seizure control, but no systematic research has been conducted in this field.This review provides an overview of the current literature on the influence of sex hormones on seizures in humans. The literature on idiopathic epilepsy in dogs was assessed to identify potential risk factors related to sex and sterilisation status. In general, there appears to be an over-representation of male dogs with idiopathic epilepsy but no explanation for this difference in prevalence between sexes has been reported. In addition, no reliable conclusions can be drawn on the effect of sterilisation due to the lack of focused research and robust scientific evidence. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Canine; Epilepsy; Oestrus; Seizures; Sex hormones"

There is uncertainty regarding when the ACTHst should be started relative to time of trilostane administration. Objective: To compare ACTHst results in dogs being treated for NOH with trilostane when the test is begun 2 versus 4 hours after trilostane administration. Animals: Twenty-one privately owned dogs with NOH, each treated with trilostane for at least 30 days. Methods: Each dog had 2 ACTHst completed, 1 started 2 hours and the other 4 hours after trilostane administration. The second test was started no sooner than 46 hours and no later than 74 hours after the first. Results: For all 21 dogs, the mean post-ACTH serum cortisol concentration from tests started 2 hours after trilostane administration (5.4 ± 3.7 μg/dL) was significantly lower (P = .03) as compared with results from the tests started 4 hours after administration (6.5 ± 4.5 μg/dL). Conclusions: Results of ACTHst started at different times yield significantly different results.

Hypothesis/Objectives: To describe the clinical presentation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of dogs with CCA. Animals: Fifteen client-owned dogs. Methods: Retrospective study. Records of the contributing institutions were reviewed to identify dogs diagnosed with malformations affecting the corpus callosum (CC); cases in which the CCA was thought to be secondary were excluded. Results: The most represented breeds were Staffordshire Bull Terriers (5/15) and Miniature Schnauzers (3/15; n = 3, 20%) and the mean age at time of presentation of 19 months (range 3-81 months). The clinical signs most commonly reported were adipsia/hypodipsia with associated hypernatremia (12/15), tremors (6/15), and seizures (6/15). Review of the MR images revealed that 10 dogs had absence of the rostral CC and hypoplasia of the caudal portion, 4 dogs had a diffusely hypoplastic and dysplastic CC, and 1 dog had a diffusely hypoplastic CC. In 14 cases, there was abnormal cortical development with fusion of the ventral frontal lobes and part of the diencephalon, indicating lobar holoprosencephaly. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Previous literature has mainly associated CCA with adipsia and only 12 of 15 dogs in the current series demonstrated this abnormality. There are different degrees of the malformation but in 10 dogs the rostral portion of the CC is most severely affected. Fourteen dogs have simultaneous fusion of the midline structures rostral to the CC; this region has several structures involved in thirst regulation and might explain this derangement. © 2014 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Adipsia; Corpus callosum; Dog; Holoprosencephaly"

Hypothesis: Restoration of euthyroidism will decrease plasma creatinine concentrations. Animals: Nineteen client-owned, methimazole- or carbimazole-treated, hyperthyroid cats with documented iatrogenic hypothyroidism (based on subnormal plasma total thyroxine concentrations [TT4] and increased plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations). Methods: Prospective interventional study. Doses of antithyroid medication were reduced until euthyroidism was restored (TT4 10-40 nmol/L). Plasma creatinine concentration and selected other clinicopathologic variables were evaluated before and after restoration of euthyroidism and compared by nonparametric statistics. Data are presented as median [25th, 75th percentile]. Results: Restoration of euthyroidism was associated with a significant decrease in plasma creatinine concentrations (2.61 [1.90, 3.26] mg/dL versus 2.07 [1.42, 2.82] mg/dL; P < .001) and body weight (4.03 [3.59, 4.53] kg versus 3.89 [3.34, 4.18] kg; P = .019), and a significant increase in packed cell volume (30 [28, 39]% versus 34 [29, 39]%; P = .038), heart rate (174 [163, 201] bpm versus 190 [164, 202] bpm; P = .009), and plasma alkaline phosphatase activity (26.6 [17.0, 33.0] IU/L versus 38.0 [23.5, 46.5] IU/L; P < .001). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Restoration of euthyroidism in medically treated hyperthyroid cats with iatrogenic hypothyroidism causes a reduction in plasma creatinine concentrations, and thus might improve renal function; however, this could be influenced by concurrent changes in body weight. © 2014 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","ALP; Anemia; Azotemia; CKD; PCV"

The aim of this study was to describe this disease in a larger number of dogs. Objectives: Description of the signalment, clinical presentation, and imaging findings of a large number of dogs with SADs. Animals: One hundred and twenty-two dogs with SADs. Methods: Retrospective case series study. All medical records were searched for a diagnosis of SAD. The diagnosis was made based on myelography, computed tomography myelography (CT-m), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: In the 122 dogs, 125 SADs were identified. Sixty-five were located in the cervical region and 60 in the thoracolumbar region. A higher body weight was significantly associated with a cervical localization of the SAD (P < .001). Ninety-five dogs were male and 27 dogs were female. Male dogs were significantly overrepresented (P < .0001). The most commonly affected breed was the Pug dog. Previous or concurrent spinal disorders, in the near proximity of the diagnosed SAD, were seen in 26 dogs. Eight of 13 French Bulldogs and 7 of 21 Pug dogs with SADs had a previous or concurrent spinal disease, whereas other spinal disorders occurred in only 1 of 17 Rottweilers with SADs.

No sensitive and specific laboratory assays other than histopathology have been reported to differentiate non-neoplastic from neoplastic disease. Hypothesis/Objectives: Dogs with spirocercosis will have evidence of hypercoagulability based on thromboelastography (TEG)-derived maximal amplitude (MA); increased MA will be correlated with increased acute phase protein (APP) concentrations (C-reactive protein [CRP] and fibrinogen); increased MA and APPs will be exacerbated with neoplastic spirocercosis. Animals: Thirty-nine client-owned dogs with naturally occurring spirocercosis and 15 sex-matched healthy controls. Methods: A prospective comparative study evaluating TEG, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, antithrombin (AT) activity, platelet count and D-dimer concentration, and APPs of dogs with non-neoplastic (n = 24) and neoplastic (n = 15) spirocercosis compared to control dogs. Results: Median MA was significantly increased in the non-neoplastic group (P < .01) and neoplastic group (P < .01) compared to the controls. Both APPs were significantly increased in the neoplastic group compared to the non-neoplastic and control groups. MA was strongly correlated with fibrinogen (r = 0.85, P < .001) and CRP (r = 0.73, P < .001). An MA >76 mm provided 96% specificity and 73% sensitivity for differentiation of disease state. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Canine spirocercosis is associated with increased TEG variables, MA and α, and decreased AT activity, which may indicate a hypercoagulable state seemingly more severe with neoplastic transformation. MA was correlated with APP in dogs with spirocercosis and can be used as an adjunctive test to support the suspicion of neoplastic transformation. © 2013 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Hemostasis; Hypercoagulable; Inflammation; Spirocerca"

Paired measurements partitioned to five sub-ranges were collected in six cats using both methods. The results were analysed for assessment of correlation and agreement between the two methods, taking into account all pressure ranges, and with data separated in three sub-groups, low, normal and high ranges of systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure. SBP data displayed a mean correlation coefficient of 0.92 ± 0.02 that was reduced for low SBP. The agreement level evaluated from the whole data set was high and slightly reduced for low SBP values. The mean correlation coefficient of DBP was lower than for SBP (ie, 0.81 ± 0.02). The bias for DBP between the two methods was 22.3 ± 1.6 mmHg, suggesting that HDO produced lower values than telemetry. These results suggest that HDO met the validation criteria defined by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine consensus panel and provided a faithful measurement of SBP in conscious cats. For DBP, results suggest that HDO tended to underestimate DBP. This finding is clearly inconsistent with the good agreement reported in dogs, but is similar to outcomes achieved in marmosets and cynomolgus monkeys, suggesting that this is not related to HDO but is species related. The data support that the HDO is the first and only validated non-invasive blood pressure device and, as such, it is the only non-invasive reference technique that should be used in future validation studies. © ISFM and AAFP 2013.",

A semi-quantitative risk assessment identified accidental use of rinderpest virus in laboratories as the most likely cause of re-introduction. However there is little data available on the rates of laboratory biosafety breakdowns in general. In addition, any predictions based on past events are subject to various uncertainties. The aims of this study were therefore to investigate the potential usefulness of historical data for predicting the future risk of rinderpest release via laboratory biosafety breakdowns, and to investigate the impacts of the various uncertainties on these predictions.Data were collected using a worldwide online survey of laboratories, a structured search of ProMED reports and discussion with experts. A stochastic model was constructed to predict the number of laboratory biosafety breakdowns involving rinderpest that will occur over the next 10 years, based on: (1) the historical rate of biosafety breakdowns; and (2) the change in the number of laboratories that will have rinderpest virus in the next 10 years compared to historically.The search identified five breakdowns, all of which occurred during 1970-2000 and all of which were identified via discussions with experts. Assuming that our search for historical events had a sensitivity of over 60% and there has been at least a 40% reduction in the underlying risk (attributable to decreased laboratory activity post eradication) the most likely number of biosafety events worldwide was estimated to be zero over a 10 year period. However, the risk of at least one biosafety breakdown remains greater than 1 in 10,000 unless the sensitivity was at least 99% or the number of laboratories has decreased by at least 99% (based on 2000-2010 during which there were no biosafety breakdowns). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Uncertainty"

Clinical signs, tumor responses, and toxicoses were evaluat Drug residue concentrations were quantitated in 3 horses receiving of 65, 70, and 75 mg/m2 by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (plasma, feces) and liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (urine). Results: Thirty tumors, including lymphomas, carcinomas, sarcoids, and melanoma, were evaluated for efficacy. The overall response rate was 47% (95% CI, 28-65%). Doxorubicin was not found to be effective against melanomas. Lymphomas and carcinomas were most responsive. Pooled serum Cmax and half-life of doxorubicin were 121.3 ng/mL and 12.9 hours, respectively. There were no detectable residues in fecal samples up to 3 weeks after treatment and in plasma and urine after 2 and 3 days, respectively. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance: This study provides preliminary evidence that single-agent doxorubicin at a dosage of 70 mg/m2 has a broad spectrum of activity. The risk of exposure to drug residues in plasma and feces was low. Direct contact with urine-contaminated wastes should be avoided for 2 days after treatment. © 2013 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Chemotherapy; Doxorubicin; Equine; Oncology"

Dietary phosphate restriction decreases FGF-23 concentrations in humans and rodents, but this relationship has not previously been examined in the cat. Objectives: To investigate the effect of feeding renal diet on plasma FGF-23 concentrations in cats with stable azotemic CKD. Animals: Azotemic, client-owned cats (≥9 years); 33 cats ate renal diet (RD group) and 11 cats did not eat renal diet (comparator group) over 28-56 days. Methods: Retrospective longitudinal study: Plasma FGF-23, PTH, and phosphate concentrations were measured at baseline and after 28-56 days. Cats in the RD group were classified as hyperphosphatemic (HP) or normophosphatemic (NP) based on the International Renal Interest Society targets for plasma phosphate concentration. Nonparametric tests were performed. Results: In the HP group (n = 15), feeding renal diet was associated with a significant decrease in plasma phosphate (P = .001), PTH (P = .007), and FGF-23 (P = .008), but not creatinine concentrations (P = .91). In the NP group (n = 18), feeding renal diet was associated with a significant decrease in plasma FGF-23 (P = .006), but not phosphate (P = .48), PTH (P = .35), or creatinine concentrations (P = .10). No significant changes were seen in any parameters in the comparator group during the study period. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Feeding renal diet is associated with reductions in plasma FGF-23 concentrations in hyper- and normophosphatemic cats with stable azotemic CKD, suggesting that dietary phosphate restriction may enable cats with CKD to maintain normal plasma phosphate concentrations in association with lower plasma FGF-23 concentrations. © 2013 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Feline; Hyperparathyroidism; Phosphate; PTH"

Boxer ARVC has been associated with a deletion in the striatin gene in some families. Hypothesis/Objectives: We hypothesized that both presentations represent a single disease, and the development of DCM in the Boxer is associated with the striatin deletion. Animals: Thirty-three adult Boxer dogs with DCM, 29 adult Boxer dogs with the striatin deletion and ARVC, and 16 Boxers without cardiac disease. Methods: DNA samples were evaluated for the striatin deletion. Association of the deletion with the DCM phenotype was tested by a Fisher's exact test. T-tests were used to evaluate potential differences between the positive heterozygous and positive homozygous groups with DCM with regard to age, LVIDD, LVIDS, and FS%. Results: Thirty of 33 dogs with DCM were positive for the striatin deletion. The striatin mutation and the homozygous genotype were strongly associated with the DCM phenotype (P < .001 and P = .005). There was no statistical difference between the heterozygous and homozygous groups with regard to age and echocardiographic measurements. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: This study demonstrates an association between DCM in the Boxer dog and the striatin mutation, particularly with the homozygous genotype. The observation that 3/33 dogs developed DCM and lacked the striatin mutation suggests that there is at least 1 other cause of DCM in the Boxer dog. © 2013 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Boxer; Dilated cardiomyopathy; Mutation; Striatin"

For this purpose, 103 client-owned dogs weighing <20. kg (mean. ±. standard deviation, 8.5. ±. 3.0. kg; aged 9.8. ±. 2.9. years) and presenting with MVD diagnosed by echo-Doppler examination were enrolled. Nineteen healthy dogs (9.9. ±. 2.3. years; 8.7. ±. 4.2. kg) were concurrently recruited as controls. SABP was measured in unsedated dogs using the Doppler method according to the recommendations in the American College of Veterinary Medicine consensus statement.SABP was significantly increased in dogs in ISACHC class 1 ( n=. 53; median, interquartile range 140. mmHg, 130-150. mmHg) and class 2 ( n=. 21; 140. mmHg, 130-150. mmHg), compared to the control group ( n=. 19; 130. mmHg, 120-140. mmHg; P<. 0.01 and P<. 0.05, respectively), but remained within the reference interval (≤160. mmHg). Conversely, dogs in ISACHC class 3 showed a significantly lower SABP ( n=. 29, 120. mmHg, 110-130. mmHg) than those from all other ISACHC classes ( P<. 0.001) and the controls ( P<. 0.05). Additionally, SABP. <. 120. mmHg was recorded in 13/103 dogs (13%). The 13 dogs were all ISACHC class 3 (3a or 3b) and were under medical treatment for heart failure. In conclusion, MVD was often associated with SABP values that were within the reference interval, but at its upper end. However, a significant decrease in SABP was observed in dogs with ISACHC heart failure class 3. Whether such low SABP values resulted from an MVD-related decrease in cardiac output, an afterload reduction owing to cardiac treatment, or both, remains to be determined. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Canine; Echocardiography; Heart; Hypotension; ISACHC"

Hypothesis/Objectives: To test a single sample method of determining GFR in cats. Animals: The validation population (group 1) consisted of 89 client-owned cats (73 nonazotemic and 16 azotemic). A separate population of 18 healthy nonazotemic cats (group 2) was used to test the methods. Methods: Glomerular filtration rate was determined in group 1 using corrected slope-intercept iohexol clearance. Single sample clearance was determined using the Jacobsson and modified Jacobsson methods and validated against slope-intercept clearance. Extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) was determined from slope-intercept clearance with correction for the 1 compartment assumption and by deriving a prediction formula for ECFV (ECFVPredicted) based on the body weight. The optimal single sample method was tested in group 2. Results: A blood sample at 180 minutes and ECFVPredicted were optimal for single sample clearance. Mean ± SD GFR in group 1 determined using the Jacobsson and modified Jacobsson formulae was 1.78 ± 0.70 and 1.65 ± 0.60 mL/min/kg, respectively. When tested in group 2, the Jacobsson method overestimated multisample clearance. The modified Jacobsson method (mean ± SD 2.22 ± 0.34 mL/min/kg) was in agreement with multisample clearance (mean ± SD 2.19 ± 0.34 mL/min/kg). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The modified Jacobsson method provides accurate estimation of iohexol clearance in cats, from a single sample collected at 180 minutes postinjection and using a formula based on the body weight to predict ECFV.

Objectives: To assess clinical signs, clinicopathologic abnormalities, etiology, and outcome of cats with AKI, and to develop models using clinical metrics and empirically derived scores to predict outcome. Animals: One hundred and thirty-two client-owned cats. Methods: Retrospective study. Bivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify variables predictive of 30-day survival. Continuous variables outside the reference range were divided into quartiles to yield quartile-specific odds ratios (OR) for survival. Models were developed incorporating weighting factors assigned to each quartile based on the OR. A predictive score for each model was calculated for each cat by summing all weighting factors. A second, multivariable logistic regression model was created from actual values of the same variables. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to determine the models' performance. Models were further tested using a subset of cases not used in initial assessment. Results: Fifty five of 132 cats (42%) remained dialysis-independent for at least 30 days after discharge, and the remaining 77 cats either died (n = 37, 28%) or were euthanized (n = 40, 30%). The most common etiology was ureteral obstruction (n = 46, 35%). Higher scores were associated with decreased probability of survival (P < .001).

Objective: This study was undertaken to (1) determine the pituitary (ACTH) and adrenal (cortisol) response to both IV and IM administration of a currently available oCRH product in healthy cats, and (2) validate an endogenous ACTH assay for use in cats. Animals: Seventeen healthy cats receiving oCRH (n = 11) or placebo (n = 6). Methods: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study. oCRH at 1 μg/kg or placebo was given either IM or IV. Endogenous cortisol and ACTH concentrations were evaluated after the injection. A comparison of IM versus IV and placebo versus treatment was made. Results: The DiaSorin immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) assay for ACTH performed well, showing both parallelism and acceptable intra- and interassay coefficients of variation.

Methods: Retrospective case-control study. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were measured in untreated hyperthyroid hypertensive cats (HT-Pre group), initially normotensive hyperthyroid cats that develop hypertension after treatment (HT-Post group), and hyperthyroid cats that are normotensive (NT group). Data are presented as median [25th, 75th percentile]. Results: Baseline PRA was not significantly different among the 3 groups (HT-Pre group 1.50 [0.05, 2.37] ng/mL/h, HT-Post group 0.66 [0.17, 2.31] ng/mL/h, NT group 1.11 [0.57, 2.18] ng/mL/h; P = .44).

Objective: This study examined the frequency of these mutations and of the A74T polymorphism to describe their worldwide distribution and correlation with echocardiography. Animals: 1855 cats representing 28 breeds and random-bred cats worldwide, of which 446 underwent echocardiographic examination. Methods: This is a prospective cross-sectional study. Polymorphisms were genotyped by Illumina VeraCode GoldenGate or by direct sequencing. The disease status was defined by echocardiography according to established guidelines. Odds ratios for the joint probability of having HCM and the alleles were calculated by meta-analysis. Functional analysis was simulated. Results: The MYBPC3 A31P and R820W were restricted to MCO and RD, respectively. Both purebred and random-bred cats had HCM and the incidence increased with age. The A74T polymorphism was not associated with any phenotype. HCM was most prevalent in MCO homozygote for the A31P mutation and the penetrance increased with age. The penetrance of the heterozygote genotype was lower (0.08) compared with the P/P genotype (0.58) in MCO. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: A31P mutation occurs frequently in MCO cats. The high incidence of HCM in homozygotes for the mutation supports the causal nature of the A31P mutation. Penetrance is incomplete for heterozygotes at A31P locus, at least at a young age.

Its clinical relevance in cats with CKD has not been explored previously. Hypothesis/Objectives: The study objectives were (1) to determine whether FGF-23 concentrations are increased in nonazotemic cats, cats which developed azotemia within 12 months of screening compared with cats that remained non-azotemic, and (2) to evaluate the relationships between FGF-23 and PTH and FGF-23 and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Animals: Sixty-two healthy client-owned geriatric cats, 14 of which developed azotemia during the 12-month follow-up period. Methods: Healthy nonazotemic cats were recruited prospectively into the study and followed for 12 months. At the study end-point, cats were categorized into 3 groups according to plasma creatinine concentration. PTH, FGF-23, and additional biochemical variables were evaluated at baseline and after 12 months. GFR was measured by a corrected slope-intercept iohexol clearance method. Results: FGF-23 concentrations at baseline were found to be significantly increased in cats that developed azotemia (P = .001) compared with cats that did not develop azotemia.

There are no published studies examining feline FGF-23. Objectives: Validation of a method for FGF-23 quantification in feline plasma and assessment of the associations among plasma FGF-23, PTH, creatinine, and phosphate concentrations in cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Animals: One hundred nonazotemic and azotemic geriatric (&gt;9 years) client-owned cats. Methods: Retrospective cross-sectional study: Cats were categorized into 4 groups: control group (plasma creatinine (Cr) ≤2.0 mg/dL), stage 2 (Cr 2.1-2.8 mg/dL), stage 3 (Cr 2.9-5.0 mg/dL), stage 4 (Cr &gt;5.0 mg/dL). Stages 2 and 3 were further subdivided based on International Renal Interest Society targets for plasma phosphate concentration (PO4): stage 2a (PO4 ≤4.5 mg/dL), stage 2b (PO4 &gt;4.5 mg/dL), stage 3a (PO4 ≤5 mg/dL), stage 3b (PO4 &gt;5 mg/dL). Plasma FGF-23 concentrations were measured by a human intact FGF-23 ELISA. Descriptive statistics and linear regression were performed. Results: The ELISA demonstrated acceptable precision, reproducibility, and specificity. Plasma FGF-23 concentrations increased with increasing plasma creatinine concentrations and were significantly different between all groups (P &lt; .008). Plasma FGF-23 concentrations were significantly higher in cats in stage 2b than stage 2a (P = .008) and in stage 3b than in stage 3a (P = .012). Phosphate, log creatinine, total calcium, log parathyroid hormone, and packed cell volume were all independent predictors of FGF-23.

Although a broad arsenal of diagnostic methods is at our disposal, the majority of the conventional diagnostic tests is highly virus-specific or is targeted entirely towards a limited group of infectious agents. This specificity complicates or even hinders the detection of new or unexpected pathogens, such as new, emerging or re-emerging viruses or novel viral variants. The recently developed approaches of viral metagenomics provide an effective novel way to screen samples and detect viruses without previous knowledge of the infectious agent, thereby enabling a better diagnosis and disease control, in line with the "" One World, One Health"" principles (www.oneworldonehealth.org). Using metagenomic approaches, we have recently identified a broad variety of new viruses, such as novel bocaviruses, Torque Teno viruses, astroviruses, rotaviruses and kobuviruses in porcine disease syndromes, new virus variants in honeybee populations, as well as a range of other infectious agents in further host species.

Companion animals are offered increasingly advanced veterinary treatments, sometimes involving home care. Owners choosing such treatments could thus face similar challenges when caring for their animals. This qualitative study uncovers impacts on an owner's life, when attending to the care of an aged or chronically ill dog and reflects on the differing roles of caregivers with animal and human patients. Twelve dog owners were selected for in-depth interviews based on the dogs' diagnoses, and the choice of treatments and care expected to affect the owner's life. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed qualitatively. The dog owners reported several changes in their lives due to their dog's condition: practicalities like extra care, changes in use of the home, and restrictions relating to work, social life, and finances. These were time-consuming, tough, and annoying, but could often be dealt with through planning and prioritizing. Changes in the human-dog relationship and activities caused sadness and frustration, which in turn led to feelings of guilt, and in some cases created a feeling of loss. Also, concerns about the progress of the dog's condition, it's welfare, and euthanasia brought emotional distress and many doubts. The owners did, however, respond to the changes differently and as a result experienced different effects on their own life. This study confirms that the situations of caregivers with human and animal patients are in some ways similar, yet the study also identifies and reflects on some of the differences. These include the caregiver role and the options of assistance as well as euthanasia. Veterinary staffare urged to inform owners about possible impacts on their lives when considering careconsuming treatments, and to be aware of the need for support during treatment as well as in decisions about euthanasia. © ISAZ 2013.","Caregiver burden; Dog owner; Grief; Human-animal bond; Quality of life; Veterinary treatment"

Animals: Forty-five client-owned dogs (8 dogs with pheochromocytoma, 11 dogs with adrenocortical tumors, 15 dogs with nonadrenal disease, and 11 healthy dogs.) Methods: A prospective study. EDTA plasma was collected from diseased and healthy dogs and submitted for fMN and fNMN measurement by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: Free MN concentration (median [range]) was significantly higher in dogs with pheochromocytoma (8.15 [1.73-175.23] nmol/L) than in healthy dogs (0.95 [0.68-3.08] nmol/L; P < .01) and dogs with adrenocortical tumors (0.92 [0.25-2.51] nmol/L; P < .001), but was not different from dogs with nonadrenal disease (1.91 [0.41-6.57] nmol/L; P ≥ .05).

Inhibin has not been examined in dogs as a serum biomarker for adrenal gland tumors. Objective: To determine serum inhibin concentration in dogs with adrenal gland disease and in healthy dogs. Animals: Forty-eight neutered dogs with adrenal disease including pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH, 17), adrenocortical tumor (18), and PHEO (13), and 41 healthy intact or neutered dogs. Methods: Prospective observational study. Dogs were diagnosed with PDH, adrenocortical tumor (hyperadrenocorticism or noncortisol secreting), or PHEO based on clinical signs, endocrine function tests, abdominal ultrasound examination, and histopathology. Inhibin concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay in serum before and after ACTH stimulation, and before and after treatment. Results: In neutered dogs, median inhibin concentration was significantly higher in dogs with adrenocortical tumors (0.82 ng/mL) and PDH (0.16 ng/mL) than in dogs with PHEO and healthy dogs (both undetectable). Median inhibin concentration was significantly higher in dogs with adrenocortical tumors than in those with PDH and decreased after adrenalectomy.

Animals and Methods: Retrospective case series study. Eighteen Basset Hounds presented for evaluation of a suspected cervical spinal cord problem. All dogs underwent computed tomography myelography or magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical region. Results: Thirteen male and 5 female Basset Hounds between 6 months and 10.8 years of age (median: 1.4 years) were studied. Clinical signs varied from cervical hyperesthesia to nonambulatory tetraparesis. Imaging demonstrated a well-defined and smooth hypertrophy of the dorsal lamina and spinous process of ≥2 adjacent vertebrae. Although this bony abnormality could decrease the ventrodorsal vertebral canal diameter, dorsal midline spinal cord compression was predominantly caused by ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. The articulation between C4 and C5 was most commonly affected. Three dogs were lost to follow-up, 10 dogs underwent dorsal laminectomy, and medical management was initiated in 5 dogs. Surgery resulted in a good outcome with short hospitalization times (median: 4.5 days) in all dogs, whereas medical management produced more variable results. Histopathology confirmed ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and demonstrated the fibrocartilaginous nature of this anomaly. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Dorsal lamina and spinous process hypertrophy leading to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy should be included in the differential diagnosis of Basset Hounds with cervical hyperesthesia or myelopathy. Prognosis after decompressive surgery is favorable.

It is important for the practitioner to understand how clinical information is collected, analyzed, and communicated in journals and presentations at conferences. Clinical research is either retrospective in observational studies, looking at historical medical records as the source of data, or prospective in both experimental and observational studies, where the study is designed before any patients are included. Prospective, experimental studies provide the more reliable results, although they form a minority of published reports. Randomized, controlled trials are the most reliable format, and attempts should be made to use this design more often in veterinary medicine. Care must be taken in the conduct of clinical research to reduce sources of bias that can yield false findings, particularly in small, retrospective studies. Statistical analysis is the key to data interpretation, but must be applied appropriately to avoid either wrong assumptions or misconception. Regardless of how studies are conducted, it is important for the practitioner to be an astute reader of the clinical literature.

Dose recommendations have varied from the manufacturer and the literature. Hypothesis: As body weight increases, dose/kg or dosage/day of trilostane required to control the clinical signs of PDH decreases. Animals: 70 dogs with naturally occurring hyperadrenocorticism. Methods: Retrospective study. Each dog must have been treated for at least 6 months and should have shown a ""good response"" to trilostane, as determined by owners. Statistical comparisons of dose and dosage were made after the dogs were separated into groups weighing <15 or >15 kg; groups weighing ≤10, 10.1-20, 20.1-30, and ≥30 kg; and then groups based on body surface area versus dose/kg and total amount of trilostane required to control the condition. Results: There was no significant difference in trilostane dose in mg/kg of body weight or in the total amount of trilostane required daily to control clinical signs, except when the dose for dogs weighing >30 kg was compared with that for the other groups. However, despite lack of statistical significance when comparing groups, there was a significant trend using polynomial regression analysis, suggesting that as body weight increases, the amount of trilostane (mg/kg/dose as well as mg/kg/daily dosage) required to control clinical signs decreases. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Dogs weighing >30 kg, and possibly those weighing >15 kg, might require smaller amounts of trilostane per dose or per day than those weighing less, to control PDH-associated clinical signs. © 2012 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Hyperadrenocorticism; Pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism; Trilostane"

Design: Prospective and retrospective observational study. Setting: Private veterinary emergency clinic. Animals: Four hundred and eighty-five client-owned dogs and cats. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: A VTL was composed using a human triage system and data from medical records of the study group. Target waiting times were prospectively determined using intuition by veterinary nurses (TWT-N). Target waiting times were subsequently determined retrospectively by the use of the VTL (TWT-VTL). Both TWT-N and TWT-VTL were compared against target waiting times determined by a review team (TWT-R), which was considered the gold standard. TWT categories included 0, 15, 30-60, and 120 minutes, and were associated with triage categories red, orange, yellow, and green, respectively. Differences in agreement were tested for significance. One hundred and eighty-five dogs and 300 cats fulfilled the inclusion criteria. TWT-N and TWT-R agreed on 30 cases of 67 (44.8%) in triage category red and 22 of 89 (24.7%) in category orange. TWT-VTL and TWT-R agreed on 64 cases of 67 (95.5%) in category red and 75 of 89 (84.3%) in category orange. Agreement between TWT-VTL and TWT-R (Pearson's R = 0.848) was significantly greater (P < 0.001) than agreement between TWT-N and TWT-R (Pearson's R = 0.519). Conclusions: Intuitive triage performed by veterinary nurses showed significantly less correlation with TWT-R than triage performed with the VTL.

Related agents induce sleep-like behavior when administered to horses. Interpretation of electroencephalograms (EEGs) obtained from sedated horses should take into account background activity, presence of sleep-related EEG events, and the animal's behavior. Hypothesis: Sedatives induce states of vigilance that are indistinguishable on EEGs from those that occur naturally. Animals: Six healthy horses. Methods: Digital EEG with video was recorded after administration of 1 of 4 sedatives (acepromazine, butorphanol, xylazine, or detomidine). Serum drug concentrations were measured. Recordings were reviewed, states were identified, and representative EEG samples were analysed. These data were compared with data previously obtained during a study of natural sleep. Results: Butorphanol was associated with brief episodes resembling slow wave sleep in 1 horse. Acepromazine led to SWS in 3 horses, including 1 that also exhibited rapid eye movement sleep. Periods of SWS were observed in all horses afer xylazine or detomidine administration. Normal sleep-related EEG events and heart block, occurred in association with SWS regardless of which sedative was used. Spectral data varied primarily by state, but some differences were observed between sedative and natural data. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Qualitatively, EEG findings appeared identical whether sedation-induced or naturally occurring. The startle response and heart block associated with some sedatives may be related to sleep. Alpha 2 agonists can be used to obtain high quality EEGs in horses, but acepromazine does not promote a relaxed state in all animals. © 2012 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Acepromazine; Butorphanol; Detomidine; Equine sleep; Xylazine"

Studies investigating this syndrome are lacking in dogs. Hypothesis: Airway collapse is independent of left atrial enlargement. Animals: A total of 16 dogs presenting with chronic cough in the absence of congestive heart failure. Group 1 dogs (n = 10) had moderate-to-severe left atrial enlargement based on an echocardiographically calculated left atrial:aortic surface area [LA:Ao(a)] > 6. Group 2 dogs (n = 6) had no to mild left atrial enlargement [LA:Ao(a) ≤ 6]. Methods: Dogs were prospectively evaluated. CBC, biochemistry, urinalysis, cervical and thoracic radiographs, fluoroscopy, echocardiography, and bronchoscopy were performed. Bronchoscopic abnormalities were compared between groups using Fisher's Exact Test. P < .05 was considered significant. Results: Fluoroscopy identified airway collapse in both groups.

Objectives: To describe CKD progression and identify risk factors for progression in newly diagnosed azotemic cats. Animals: A total of 213 cats with CKD (plasma creatinine concentration > 2 mg/dL, urine specific gravity < 1.035) were followed up until progression occurred or for at least 1 year; 132, 73, and 8 cats were in International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stages 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Methods: Progression was defined as a 25% increase in plasma creatinine concentration. Logistic regression was used to assess variables at diagnosis that were associated with progression within 1 year. Changes in IRIS stage during follow-up also were described. Cases that remained in stages 2 or 3, but did not have renal function assessed in the last 60 days of life, were excluded from analysis of the proportion reaching stage 4. Results: Of the cats, 47% (101) progressed within 1 year of diagnosis. High plasma phosphate concentration and high urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC) predicted progression in all cats. Low PCV and high UPC independently predicted progression in stage 2 cats, whereas higher plasma phosphate concentration predicted progression in stage 3 cats; 19% (18/94) of cats diagnosed in stage 2; and 63% (34/54) of cats diagnosed in stage 3 reached stage 4 before they died. Conclusions: Proteinuria, anemia, and hyperphosphatemia may reflect more progressive kidney disease.

Objectives: Determine clinical signs, hematologic changes, duration of bacteremia, and pattern of seroconversion in Bartonella henselae or Bartonella bovis-inoculated horses. Animals: Twelve (2 groups of 6) randomly selected healthy adult horses seronegative and culture negative for Bartonella spp. Methods: Experimental/observational study: Group I: B. henselae or saline control was inoculated intradermally into 4 naïve and 2 sentinel horses, respectively. Group II: same design was followed by means of B. bovis. Daily physical examinations, once weekly CBC, immunofluorescent antibody assay serology, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and twice weekly blood cultures were performed for 6 weeks and at postinoculation day 80 and 139. Bartonella alpha-Proteobacteria growth medium (BAPGM) enrichment blood culture was performed for horses that seroconverted to B. henselae antigens. Results: Transient clinical signs consistent with bartonellosis occurred in some Bartonella-inoculated horses, but hematological alterations did not occur. Three B. henselae-inoculated horses seroconverted, whereas 1 B. bovis-inoculated horse was weakly seropositive. In Group I, B. henselae was amplified and sequenced from BAPGM blood culture as well as a subculture isolate from 1 horse, blood from a 2nd horse, and BAPGM blood culture from a 3rd horse although a subculture isolate was not obtained. All sentinels remained PCR, culture, and serology negative. Conclusions: Detection of Bartonella sp. in blood after experimental inoculation supports bacteremia and seroconversion. Culture with BAPGM may be required to detect Bartonella sp. Although mild clinical signs followed acute infection, no long-term effects were noted for 2 years postinoculation. © 2012 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Animal model; Bacterial; Bacterial species; Bartonella; Bartonellosis; Epidemiology; Horse; Infectious diseases; Microbiology; Species Zoonoses"

Data Sources: Prospective, retrospective, and review articles, as well as textbook chapters in both human and veterinary medicine. Articles were primarily, but not exclusively, retrieved via Medline. Human Data Synthesis: In people, platelets are known to play a key role in the development of arterial thrombosis in numerous disease states and antiplatelet drugs are the cornerstone in the treatment of acute events and for prevention in patients at risk. For many years, aspirin was used as the sole antiplatelet drug in people, but the introduction of adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonists and integrin αIIbβ3 inhibitors has significantly improved outcome in selective groups of patients. Veterinary Data Synthesis: The understanding of platelet activation in disease states has increased dramatically over the past decade. Simultaneously, a host of new methods for evaluating platelet function have been developed, which enable primarily researchers, but also clinicians to monitor the activity of platelets. Many of these methods have been validated for research purposes, but few have found their way to the clinics. Not a single correctly randomized clinical trial has been carried out with any antiplatelet drug for any indication in dogs or cats, and consequently, treatment is empiric and largely based on expert opinion or data from experimental studies. Conclusions: The pathogenesis of thromboembolic disease is complex and multifactorial and the role of hyperactive platelets in this etiology remains to be clarified in most of the diseases associated with thrombosis in dogs and cats. Until efficacy data from well-designed studies are available, antithrombotic therapy should consist of close monitoring, good supportive care, and judicious empirical use of antiplatelet agents. © 2012 Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society.","Aggregation; Antiplatelet; Hemostasis; Pharmacotherapy"

This study evaluated the efficacy of recombinant human protamine zinc insulin (rhPZI) for treating diabetic dogs. Hypothesis: rhPZI is effective for treating diabetic dogs. Animals: Six newly diagnosed and 11 insulin-treated diabetic dogs. Methods: Prospective clinical trial. Dogs were treated with rhPZI for 60 days. Control of glycemia was assessed on days 7, 14, 30, and 60 by evaluation of history, physical examination, body weight, serum fructosamine concentration, and blood glucose concentrations measured before and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after rhPZI administration. Adjustments in dosage of rhPZI were made as needed to control glycemia.

It could indicate changes in renal hemodynamics. Hypothesis/Objectives: To assess the renal resistive index (RI) in dogs with DMVD, and the statistical link between heart failure class, azotemia, echo-Doppler parameters, several plasma variables, and RI. Animals: Fifty-five dogs with naturally occurring DVMD were used (ISACHC class 1 [n = 28], 2 [n = 19], and 3 [n = 8]). Methods: Observational, blinded study, performed under standardized conditions. Physical examination, renal ultrasonography, and echo-Doppler examinations were performed in awake dogs. The RI of the renal, interlobar, and arcuate arteries were measured. Plasma creatinine, urea, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations (NT-proBNP) were determined. Statistical links between variables and RI were tested by means of a general linear model. Results: Although the RI of renal and arcuate arteries were unaffected by ISACHC class, the left interlobar RI increased (P < .001) from 0.62 ± 0.05 (mean ± SD) in class 1 to 0.76 ± 0.08 in class 3. It was also higher (P < .001) in azotemic (0.74 ± 0.08) than in non-azotemic (0.62 ± 0.05) dogs. Similar findings were observed for right interlobar RI.

Successful work-up relies on a thorough clinical and neurological examination, and logical problem solving, based on an understanding of the underlying neuroanatomical and pathophysiological mechanisms. Clinical challenges: Feline neuromuscular diseases can be a diagnostic challenge. On initial inspection, the presenting signs can mimic disorders of other body systems, particularly cardiovascular, pulmonary and orthopaedic disease, or may be confused with systemic illnesses. Additionally, because many different pathologies of the feline neuromuscular system converge to a similar clinical phenotype, further diagnostic steps such as electrodiagnostics, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and muscle and nerve biopsies must be considered even after neuromuscular dysfunction has been identified. Audience: This review provides a framework for the clinical approach to the weak cat and gives a practical summary of neuromuscular diseases for the general practitioner and specialist alike. Evidence base: Many diseases affecting the feline neuromuscular system have been well described in the veterinary literature, mostly based on retrospective case reports and series. The evidence base for the treatment of feline neuromuscular diseases remains very limited. © 2011 ISFM and AAFP.",

Risk factors for reactivation include stress and illness. The risk of asymptomatic shedding in hospitalized, critically ill horses with acute abdominal disease is unknown. This information is important to assess the need for additional biosecurity protocols to prevent spread of EHV-1 in hospitalized critically ill horses with acute abdominal disorders. Objectives: To determine the frequency of reactivation and nasal shedding of EHV-1 in hospitalized critically ill horses. Animals: One hundred twenty-four client-owned horses admitted to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital with acute abdominal disorders were included in the study. Methods: Cross-sectional study examining the risk of reactivation of EHV-1 in horses admitted with acute, severe, gastrointestinal disease. Whole blood and nasal secretions were collected throughout hospitalization. In addition, mandibular lymph nodes were collected from 9 study horses and 26 other Michigan horses. All samples were tested for the presence of EHV-1 nucleic acid by real-time PCR assays targeting the glycoprotein B gene and the polymerase (ORF 30) gene. Results: One hundred and twenty-four horses met the inclusion criteria. None of the samples were positive for EHV-1 DNA. Conclusion and Clinical Importance: These results suggest that nasal shedding and viremia of EHV-1 in hospitalized critically ill horses with acute abdominal disorder is extremely rare. Implementation of additional biosecurity protocols to limit aerosol spread of EHV-1 among horses with acute abdominal disease and other hospitalized horses is not necessary. © 2011 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Gastrointestinal disease; Horse; Nasal shedding; Reactivation"

In a previous study, a higher prevalence of thyroid nodular disease was found in euthyroid geriatric cats with undetectable TSH (<0.03 ng/mL) compared to those with detectable TSH concentrations, suggesting subclinical hyperthyroidism might also exist in cats. Hypothesis: Euthyroid cats with undetectable TSH concentrations have subclinical hyperthyroidism and may subsequently develop overt signs of hyperthyroidism. Animals: One-hundred four client-owned cats. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, euthyroid geriatric (≥9 years) cats were recruited during routine health checks. Plasma biochemistry was performed at baseline and every 6 months thereafter. Total thyroxine and TSH concentrations were determined annually. Short-term follow-up data (within 14 months of recruitment) were used to detect variables at entry that were predictive of the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, using univariable analysis followed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Log rank analysis was used to test the association of initial TSH concentration with diagnosis of hyperthyroidism during the total available follow-up. Results and Conclusions: Median (range) follow-up was 26 (0-54) months and annual incidence of hyperthyroidism during the study was 7.4%. Cats that became hyperthyroid within 14 months had higher ALKP activity (P = 0.02) and higher prevalence of goiter (P = .03) at baseline than controls. Cats with undetectable TSH at baseline (29/104; 28%) were significantly (P < .001) more likely to be diagnosed with hyperthyroidism.

Cardiac biomarkers play a critical role in the early detection of subclinical cardiac disease, in the prediction of long-term prognosis, and in monitoring the response to therapy in humans. Hypothesis: Circulating concentrations of the biomarkers N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) will decrease after chronic administration of atenolol PO to cats with severe HCM but no signs of heart failure. Animals: Six Maine Coon or Maine Coon cross cats with severe HCM. Methods: Cats were treated with atenolol (12.5mg PO q12h) for 30 days. No cat had left ventricular dynamic outflow tract obstruction caused by systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. The concentrations of NT-proBNP and cTnI were assayed before and on the last day of drug administration. Results: There was no statistically significant change in NT-proBNP (median before, 394pmol/L; range, 71-1,500pmol/L; median after, 439pmol/L; range, 24-1,500pmol/L; P = .63) or in cTnI (median before, 0.24ng/mL; range, 0.10-0.97ng/mL; median after, 0.28ng/mL; range, 0.09-1.0ng/mL; P = .69) after administration of atenolol. Conclusions: Atenolol administration did not decrease NT-proBNP or cTnI concentrations in cats with severe left ventricular hypertrophy caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. These results suggest that atenolol did not decrease myocardial ischemia and myocyte death in these cats. A larger clinical trial is warranted to verify these findings. © 2011 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Beta blocker; Biomarker; Drug therapy; Myocardial ischemia"

However, little is known about SHT-related cardiac changes in dogs. Hypothesis: SHT in dogs is responsible for morphological and functional cardiac alterations. Animals: Thirty dogs with spontaneous untreated SHT and 28 age- and body weight-matched healthy dogs as controls. Methods: Prospective observational study. Conventional echocardiography and 2-dimensional color tissue Doppler imaging were performed in SHT dogs by trained observers and compared with controls. Results: Forty-seven percent of SHT dogs (14/30) had diffuse concentric hypertrophy. None had left atrial dilatation and 10/30 (33%) had aortic insufficiency (AoI) associated with proximal aortic dilatation. Longitudinal diastolic left ventricular free wall (LVFW) motion was altered in all SHT dogs at the base (early to late diastolic wave ratio, E/A = 0.5 ± 0.1 versus 1.3 ± 0.3 for controls, P < .0001) and the apex (E/A = 1.6 ± 1.7 versus 3.9 ± 3.1, P < .05). Longitudinal motion of the interventricular septum at the base (E/A = 0.7 ± 0.4 versus 1.1 ± 0.1, P < .01) and radial LVFW motion in the subendocardium (E/A = 0.9 ± 0.5 versus 1.6 ± 0.3, P < .01) were also altered in dogs with SHT. Longitudinal LVFW systolic velocities and gradients were also significantly decreased (P < .05) in SHT dogs. Conclusion and Clinical Importance: As in SHT in cats, SHT in dogs is associated with myocardial dysfunction independently of the presence of myocardial hypertrophy. However, unlike feline SHT, it results in a homogeneous LV geometric pattern with a relatively high prevalence of AoI. © 2011 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Blood pressure; Diastolic function; Dog; Echocardiography; Heart"

Published assessments of outcome are limited. Objective: Evaluate type and prevalence of complications and risk factors for death and complications in dogs and cats receiving PN. Animals: Three hundred and nineteen dogs and 112 cats that received PN at a teaching hospital between 2000 and 2008. Methods: Retrospective case review. Diagnosis, duration of PN administration, concurrent enteral feeding, death, and mechanical, septic, and metabolic complications were abstracted from medical records. Association of each parameter with complications and death was analyzed by binary logistic regression. Results: Pancreatitis was the most common diagnosis (109/319 dogs, 34/112 cats), and 137/319 dogs and 51/112 cats died. Dogs and cats received 113 ± 40% and 103 ± 32% of resting energy requirement, respectively. Mechanical (81/319 dogs, 16/112 cats) and septic (20/319 dogs, 6/112 cats) complications were not associated with death (P > .05). Hyperglycemia was the most common metabolic complication (96/158 dogs, 31/37 cats). Hypercreatininemia in dogs (8/79) was the only complication associated with death (P < .01). Chronic kidney disease in dogs, hepatic lipidosis in cats, and longer duration of inadequate caloric intake before PN in both species were negatively associated with survival (P < .05). Factors positively associated with survival included longer duration of PN administration in both species, enteral feeding in cats with any disease, and enteral feeding in dogs with respiratory disease (P < .05). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: PN can be effectively used to provide the energy requirements of most critically ill dogs and cats. Most complications accompanying PN administration do not affect survival.

This lack of standardization has made the evaluation and comparison of studies difficult. Most important, translating these results to clinical applications is problematic. To address this issue, the American College of Veterinary Pathologists' Oncology Committee organized an initiative to establish guidelines for the conduct and reporting of prognostic studies in veterinary oncology. The goal of this initiative is to increase the quality and standardization of veterinary prognostic studies to facilitate independent evaluation, validation, comparison, and implementation of study results. This article represents a consensus statement on the conduct and reporting of prognostic studies in veterinary oncology from veterinary pathologists and oncologists from around the world. These guidelines should be considered a recommendation based on the current state of knowledge in the field, and they will need to be continually reevaluated and revised as the field of veterinary oncology continues to progress.

The detection limit for the RT-PCR assay was 3 and 10 organisms, respectively, when spiked samples were purified from selenite broth and feces. The analytical specificity was 100% based on the detection of a panel of 40 salmonella serotypes from five serogroups and the lack of cross-reactivity with non-related micro-organisms.

Objectives: To describe the viral kinetics of reactivated EHV-1 in blood and nasal secretions from latently infected horses after administration of corticosteroids, and to study the infectious nature of reactivated EHV-1 to sentinel horses. Animals: Eight healthy horses. Methods: Four horses infected 4 months previously with EHV-1 received dexamethasone on 5 consecutive days. Four seronegative horses served as sentinels and had direct contact with the latently infected horses. All horses were monitored daily for development of clinical signs. Whole blood and nasal secretions were collected daily for molecular detection and cell culture of EHV-1. Serum was collected weekly for the detection of antibodies against EHV-1. Results: All horses in the latently infected group showed transient molecular detection of EHV-1 in blood and nasal secretions, but only 1 horse developed fever.

Twenty-eight of 41 cats (68%) with plasma TT4 concentration below the laboratory reference range had an increased plasma TSH concentration. Hypothyroid cats that developed azotemia within the follow-up period had significantly (P 5 .018) shorter survival times (median survival time 456 days, range 231-1589 days) than those that remained nonazotemic (median survival time 905 days, range 316-1869 days). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Iatrogenic hypothyroidism appears to contribute to the development of azotemia after treatment of hyperthyroidism, and reduced survival time in azotemic cats. © 2010 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Euthyroid-sick syndrome; Subclinical hypothyroidism; Thyroid stimulating hormone"

No practical and reliable means for identifying those cats that will develop azotemia after treatment for hyperthyroidism has been identified. Hyperthyroidismis associated with proteinuria. Proteinuria has been correlated with decreased survival of cats with CKD and with progression of CKD. Hypothesis: Proteinuria and other clinical parameters measured at diagnosis of hyperthyroidism will be associated with the development of azotemia and survival time. Animals: Three hundred client owned hyperthyroid cats treated in first opinion practice. Methods: Retrospective, cohort study relating clinical parameters in hyperthyroid cats at diagnosis to the development of azotemia within 240 days of diagnosis and survival time (all cause mortality). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors that were predictive of the development of azotemia. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with survival. Results: Three hundred cats were eligible for survival analysis and 216 cats for analysis of factors associated with the development of azotemia. The median survival time was 417 days, and 15.3%(41/268) cats developed azotemia within 240 days of diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine were positively correlated with the development of azotemia. Plasma globulin concentration was negatively correlated with the development of azotemia. Age, urine protein: creatinine ratio, and the presence of hypertension were significantly correlated with decreased survival time. Urine specific gravity and PCV were significantly correlated with increased survival time. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The proteinuria associated with hyperthyroidism is not a mediator of progression of CKD; however, it does correlate with all cause mortality. © 2010 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Chronic kidney disease; Endocrinology; Proteinuria; Thyroid gland"

The objective of the present study was to evaluate and compare three different TEG assays in healthy cats, in order to establish which assay may be best suited for TEG analyses in cats.Methods: 90 TEG analyses were performed on citrated whole blood samples from 15 clinically healthy cats using assays without activator (native) or with human recombinant tissue factor (TF) or kaolin as activators. Results for reaction time (R), clotting time (K), angle (α), maximum amplitude (MA) and clot lysis (LY30; LY60) were recorded.Results: Coefficients of variation (CVs) were highest in the native assay and comparable in TF and kaolin activated assays. Significant differences were observed between native and kaolin assays for all measured parameters, between kaolin and TF for all measured parameters except LY60 and between native and TF assays for R and K.Conclusion: The results indicate that TEG is a reproducible method for evaluation of haemostasis in clinically healthy cats. However, the three assays cannot be used interchangeably and the kaolin- and TF activated assays have the lowest analytical variation indicating that using an activator may be superior for performing TEG in cats. © 2010 Marschner et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

Objectives: Describe clinical, hematologic, biochemical, serologic, molecular, and ultrasonographic findings in foals experimentally infected with Lawsonia intracellularis. Animals: Eight foals. Methods: Recently weaned foals were assigned to either the challenge (n = 3), the sentinel (n = 3), or the control (n = 2) group. Foals were experimentally challenged via intragastric inoculation of 3 × 1010 L. intracellularis organisms grown in culture. Each experimentally infected foal was housed with a sentinel foal in order to assess feco-oral transmission. All foals were monitored daily for the development of clinical abnormalities and were weighed once weekly for the duration of the study (90 days). Abdominal ultrasound examination was performed weekly. Feces were collected every other day for 60 days, then weekly for an additional 30 days for the quantitative molecular detection of L. intracellularis. Blood was collected weekly for hematologic, biochemical, and serologic analysis. Results: Only challenged foals developed transient clinical signs of EPE consisting of anorexia, lethargy, fever, loose feces, and peripheral edema. Two challenged foals developed transient hypoalbuminemia. Fecal shedding of L. intracellularis was first detected in the challenged foals between days 12 and 18 postinoculation and lasted for 7-21 days. Seroconversion was documented in all challenged foals and in 1 sentinel foal. The remaining sentinel and control foals remained unaffected. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Clinical EPE of variable severity was induced in all foals infected with L. intracellularis. Furthermore, L. intracellularis can be transmitted via the feco-oral route to susceptible herdmates.

Identification of high risk groups for MRSA carriage is vital for the success of infection control programmes. Veterinary staff may be one such risk group but little is known about pet owners and the role of contact with infected pets. As part of a UK-wide case-control study investigating risk factors for MRSA infection in dogs and cats between 2005 and 2008, 608 veterinary staff and pet owners in contact with 106 MRSA and 91 meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA)-infected pets were screened for S. aureus nasal carriage. Laboratory isolation and characterisation included salt broth enrichment, standard and automated microbiological tests, demonstration of the S. aureus-specific thermonuclease gene (nuc) and of mecA, and polymerase chain reaction-based lineage characterisation. MRSA carriage was 12.3% in veterinarians attending MRSA-infected animals and 7.5% in their owners. In the MSSA control group, MRSA carriage was 4.8% in veterinary staff and 0% in owners. Veterinary staff carried MRSA more frequently than owners (odds ratio: 2.33; 95% confidence interval: 1.10-4.93). All MRSA from humans and all but one animal MRSA were CC22 or CC30, typical for hospital MRSA in the UK. This study indicates for the first time an occupational risk for MRSA carriage in small animal general practitioners. Veterinary staff and owners of MRSA-infected pets are high risk groups for MRSA carriage despite not having direct hospital links. Strategies to break the cycle of MRSA infection must take these potential new reservoirs into account. © 2009 The Hospital Infection Society.","Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Nasal carriage; Pet owners; Risk groups; Veterinary staff"

In 2006, owners took their dogs to veterinarians more than twice as often as cats, averaging 2.3 times/year, compared with 1.1 times/year for cats, and significantly more dogs (58%) than cats (28%) were seen by a veterinarian one or more times/year.2 Cat owners often express a belief that cats 'do not need medical care'. Two reasons for this misconception are that signs of illness are often difficult to detect, and cats are perceived to be self-sufficient.2 One role of the veterinarian is to develop a partnership with cat owners that will pave the way for a lifelong health care plan. These guidelines aim to outline an evidence-based life stage wellness program to aid the veterinary medical team in delivering the best comprehensive care for cats. Specific goals are to provide:. &lt; Recommendations for optimal health care for cats throughout the different life stages. &lt; Practical suggestions and tools to facilitate improved veterinary visits and to enhance the client-veterinarian clinical encounter. &lt; A foundation from which to access sources of additional information. Life stage classification: Distinct life stages (age groups) in cats are not well defined, in part because individual animals and body systems age at different rates, a process that is influenced by many factors. These guidelines follow one convenient classification (see box below). These age designations help to focus attention on the physical and behavioral changes that occur at different stages (eg, congenital defects in kittens, obesity prevention in the junior cat). It must be recognized, however, that any age groupings are inevitably arbitrary demarcations along a spectrum, and not absolutes. Evidence-based health care: Supporting references for specific recommendations are supplied where possible, and any previously published guidelines on particular topics are referred to where relevant. Readers should note, however, that the guidelines panel was hampered in its efforts by the relative paucity of disease incidence data by age group that is available, and there is an urgent need for research to guide the future of evidence-based feline health care.3. © 2009.",

Hypothesis: Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and Clostridium difficile Toxin A and B are associated with diarrhea in racing sled dogs. Animals: One hundred and thirty-five sled dogs. Methods: Freshly voided feces were obtained from 55 dogs before racing and from 80 dogs after 400 miles of racing. Samples were visually scored for diarrhea, mucus, blood, and melena. CPE and C. difficile Toxin A and B were detected by ELISA. Samples were cultured for C. perfringens, C. difficile, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli 0157; Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. were detected via immunofluorescence. Results: Diarrhea occurred in 36% of dogs during racing, and hematochezia, fecal mucus or melena, or all 3 occurred in 57.5% of dogs. Salmonella was isolated from 78.2% of dogs before racing, and from 71.3% of dogs during racing. C. perfringens and C. difficile were isolated from 100 and 58.2% of dogs before racing, and from 95 and 36.3% of dogs during racing. Dogs were more likely to test positive for CPE during than before racing (18.8 versus 5.5%, P 5 .021); however, no enteropathogens or their respective toxins were significantly associated with hematochezia or diarrhea. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Sled dogs participating in long distance racing have a high prevalence of diarrhea and hematochezia that is not associated with common enteropathogens.

Objective: To describe the clinical, echocardiographic, and necropsy findings and breed predilection of congenital cardiac defects in neonatal foals. Animals: Eighteen foals <15 days of age with 1 or more congenital cardiac defects. Methods: Medical records of foals diagnosed with congenital cardiac defects at the William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital were reviewed. Data collected included history, signalment, clinical signs, laboratory data, diagnostic and necropsy results, and outcome. Results: Arabian foals represented 39% of cases with congenital cardiac defects and were significantly (P = .004) overrepresented (OR = 4.7 [CI: 1.8-12.4]) compared with the general hospital population. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) (14/18), tetralogy of Fallot (5/18), and tricuspid valve atresia (4/18) were the most common defects identified. A ≥ 3/6 heart murmur (14/14) accompanied by tachycardia (14/17), tachypnea (17/17), and cyanosis of mucous membranes (7/16) were the most common clinical signs. Concurrent congenital defects were common (9/18). Two foals, both with VSD, survived for ≥ 8 years after diagnosis and 1 was a successful performance horse. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Arabian horses appear to have a predisposition for cardiac defects. The presence of a loud murmur (≥ 3/6), cyanotic membranes, and tachycardia or tachypnea in a neonatal foal should warrant thorough evaluation of the heart for congenital defects. Foals with cardiac defects should be closely evaluated for concurrent congenital defects in other body systems. © 2009 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Cardiology; Congenital; Echocardiography; Horse"

Hypothesis: N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide plasma concentration (NT-proBNP) is correlated with mitral regurgitation (MR) severity and can predict disease progression in dogs with asymptomatic MVD. Animals: Seventy-two dogs with asymptomatic MVD, with or without heart enlargement (International Small Animal Cardiac Health Council: ISACHC classes 1a and 1b), and a control group of 22 dogs were prospectively recruited. Methods: Severity of MR was quantitatively assessed from the regurgitation fraction (RF) by the proximal isovelocity surface area method. Consequences of MR were evaluated from measurements of the left atrium/aorta ratio (LA/Ao), fractional shortening (FS), end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes indexed to body surface area (EDVI and ESVI). The relevance of these echo-Doppler indices and NT-proBNP for prediction of outcome at 12 months was studied. Results: A significant correlation was found between NT-proBNP and RF, LA/Ao, FS, and EDVI (P<.05). NT-proBNP was higher in dogs with MVD (ISACHC classes 1a and 1b) compared with the control group (P =.025 and <.001, respectively). The difference was not significant when only dogs from ISACHC class 1a with RF < 30% were considered. Lastly, NT-proBNP was higher in dogs that underwent MVD decompensation at 12 months (P<.05).

One approach provides students with a broad experience with multiple species and the other provides them with an in-depth experience with just the species that they intend to work with in practice upon graduation (the latter is termed 'tracking', i.e. students follow a course of study along a particular specialised 'track'). This study obtained extensive feedback from the graduates of two schools, each of which was representative of one of the two approaches to clinical education. A total of 1,714 students took part in a survey in which they were asked to provide information about their career paths, their professional satisfaction, and their assessment of their training, especially in comparative veterinary medicine. They were also asked to say whether or not they would have preferred a different kind of training and who they would be most likely to hire as an associate: a tracking graduate or one who had received a broadbased education. The studies show that the several concerns that have been verbalised about tracking appear to be invalid. Upon graduation more than 90% of veterinary practitioners practice in quite a narrow area of veterinary medicine. We must, therefore, consider what benefits are gained from providing the typical very general preclinical education and offering students clinical training in animals with which they do not intend to practice upon graduation.","Career-based veterinary education; Omni-competence; Tracking"

This pathogen may survive in the environment for several months and is highly resistant to some disinfectants. Infection: Transmission occurs via the faecal-oral route. Indirect contact is the most common route of infection, and FPV may be carried by fomites (shoes, clothing), which means indoor cats are also at risk. Intrauterine virus transmission and infection of neonates can occur. Disease signs: Cats of all ages may be affected by FPV, but kittens are most susceptible. Mortality rates are high - over 90% in kittens. Signs of disease include diarrhoea, lymphopenia and neutropenia, followed by thrombocytopenia and anaemia, immunosuppression (transient in adult cats), cerebellar ataxia (in kittens only) and abortion. Diagnosis: Feline panleukopenia virus antigen is detected in faeces using commercially available test kits. Specialised laboratories carry out PCR testing on whole blood or faeces. Serological tests are not recommended, as they do not distinguish between infection and vaccination. Disease management: Supportive therapy and good nursing significantly decrease mortality rates. In cases of enteritis, parenteral administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic is recommended. Disinfectants containing sodium hypochlorite (bleach), peracetic acid, formaldehyde or sodium hydroxide are effective. Vaccination recommendations: All cats - including indoor cats - should be vaccinated. Two injections, at 8-9 weeks of age and 3-4 weeks later, are recommended, and a first booster 1 year later. A third vaccination at 16-20 weeks of age is recommended for kittens from environments with a high infection pressure (cat shelters) or from queens with high vaccine-induced antibody levels (breeding catteries). Subsequent booster vaccinations should be administered at intervals of 3 years or more. Modified-live virus vaccines should not be used in pregnant queens or in kittens less than 4 weeks of age. © 2009 ESFM and AAFP.",

The subtype H5N1 avian influenza occurs primarily in birds and infection varies from mild disease with little or no mortality to a highly fatal, rapidly spreading epidemic (highly pathogenic avian influenza). It is extremely rare for cats to be infected and there are only very few confirmed reports of the disease in cats in Europe. Infection: Cats can be infected via the respiratory and oral routes (eg, by eating infected birds). The key precondition for infection is that the cat lives in an area where H5N1 virus infection has been confirmed in birds. Additionally, the cat should have had outdoor access to an environment where waterfowl is present, or contact with poultry or uncooked poultry meat, or close contact with an H5N1-infected, sick cat during the first week of infection. Clinical suspicion: Clinical signs in cats may include fever, lethargy, dyspnoea, conjunctivitis and rapid death. Neurological signs (circling, ataxia) have also been recorded. Diagnosis: The veterinary authorities should be notified. Oropharyngeal, nasal and/or rectal swabs or faecal samples of suspected cases should be submitted for PCR and/or virus isolation. Post-mortem samples of lung and mediastinal lymph nodes should be obtained. Particular care should be taken when handling the cat and/or samples. Disease management: The virus is sensitive to all standard medical disinfectants. Cats with suspected H5N1 infection should be kept in strict isolation. Owners should be advised to confine the cat to a separate room prior to bringing it to the veterinary clinic. Vaccination and disease prevention: No H5N1 vaccines are commercially available for cats. In the event of confirmed cases of H5N1 avian influenza in birds in the area, owners should keep their cats indoors until further information is available, and follow official regulations. © 2009 ESFM and AAFP.",

Most felids are susceptible to FIV, but humans are not. Feline immunodeficiency virus is endemic in domestic cat populations worldwide. The virus loses infectivity quickly outside the host and is susceptible to all disinfectants. Infection: Feline immunodeficiency virus is transmitted via bites. The risk of transmission is low in households with socially well-adapted cats. Transmission from mother to kittens may occur, especially if the queen is undergoing an acute infection. Cats with FIV are persistently infected in spite of their ability to mount antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. Disease signs: Infected cats generally remain free of clinical signs for several years, and some cats never develop disease, depending on the infecting isolate. Most clinical signs are the consequence of immunodeficiency and secondary infection. Typical manifestations are chronic gingivostomatitis, chronic rhinitis, lymphadenopathy, weight loss and immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Diagnosis: Positive in-practice ELISA results obtained in a low-prevalence or low-risk population should always be confirmed by a laboratory. Western blot is the 'gold standard' laboratory test for FIV serology. PCR-based assays vary in performance. Disease management: Cats should never be euthanased solely on the basis of an FIV-positive test result. Cats infected with FIV may live as long as uninfected cats, with appropriate management. Asymptomatic FIV-infected cats should be neutered to avoid fighting and virus transmission. Infected cats should receive regular veterinary health checks. They can be housed in the same ward as other patients, but should be kept in individual cages. Vaccination recommendations: At present, there is no FIV vaccine commercially available in Europe. Potential benefits and risks of vaccinating FIV-infected cats should be assessed on an individual cat basis. Needles and surgical instruments used on FIV-positive cats may transmit the virus to other cats, so strict hygiene is essential. © 2009 ESFM and AAFP.",

In clinical practice, rabies virus is easily inactivated by detergent-based disinfectants. Infection: Rabid animals are the only source of infection. Virus is shed in the saliva some days before the onset of clinical signs and transmitted through a bite or a scratch to the skin or mucous membranes. The average incubation period in cats is 2 months, but may vary from 2 weeks to several months, or even years. Disease signs: Any unexplained aggressive behaviour or sudden behavioural change in cats must be considered suspicious. Two disease manifestations have been identified in cats: the furious and the dumb form. Death occurs after a clinical course of 1-10 days. Diagnosis: A definitive rabies diagnosis is obtained by post-mortem laboratory investigation. However, serological tests are used for post-vaccinal control, especially in the context of international movements. Disease management: Post-exposure vaccination of cats depends on the national public health regulations, and is forbidden in many countries. Vaccination recommendations: A single rabies vaccination induces a long-lasting immunity. Kittens should be vaccinated at 12-16 weeks of age to avoid interference from maternally derived antibodies and revaccinated 1 year later. Although some vaccines protect against virulent rabies virus challenge for 3 years or more, national or local legislation may call for annual boosters. © 2009 ESFM and AAFP.",

While most FCoV-infected cats are healthy or display only a mild enteritis, some go on to develop feline infectious peritonitis, a disease that is especially common in young cats and multi-cat environments. Up to 12% of FCoV-infected cats may succumb to FIP, with stress predisposing to the development of disease. Disease signs: The 'wet' or effusive form, characterised by polyserositis (abdominal and/or thoracic effusion) and vasculitis, and the 'dry' or non-effusive form (pyogranulomatous lesions in organs) reflect clinical extremes of a continuum. The clinical picture of FIP is highly variable, depending on the distribution of the vasculitis and pyogranulomatous lesions. Fever refractory to antibiotics, lethargy, anorexia and weight loss are common non-specific signs. Ascites is the most obvious manifestation of the effusive form. Diagnosis: The aetiological diagnosis of FIP ante-mortem may be difficult, if not impossible. The background of the cat, its history, the clinical signs, laboratory changes, antibody titres and effusion analysis should all be used to help in decision-making about further diagnostic procedures. At the time of writing, there is no non-invasive confirmatory test available for cats without effusion. Disease management: In most cases FIP is fatal. Supportive treatment is aimed at suppressing the inflammatory and detrimental immune response. However, there are no controlled studies to prove any beneficial effect of corticosteroids. Vaccination recommendations: At present, only one (intranasal) FIP vaccine is available, which is considered as being non-core. Kittens may profit from vaccination when they have not been exposed to FCoV (eg, in an early-weaning programme), particularly if they enter a FCoV-endemic environment. © 2009.",

It is sensible to consider B bronchiseptica as a rare cause of zoonotic infections. The bacterium is susceptible to common disinfectants. Infection: The bacterium is shed in oral and nasal secretions of infected cats. Dogs with respiratory disease are an infection risk for cats. The microorganism colonises the ciliated epithelium of the respiratory tract of the host, establishing chronic infections. Disease signs: A wide range of respiratory signs has been associated with B bronchiseptica infection, from a mild illness with fever, coughing, sneezing, ocular discharge and lymphadenopathy to severe pneumonia with dyspnoea, cyanosis and death. Diagnosis: Bacterial culture and PCR lack sensitivity. Samples for isolation can be obtained from the oropharynx (swabs) or via transtracheal wash/ bronchoalveolar lavage. Disease management: Antibacterial therapy is indicated, even if the signs are mild. Where sensitivity data are unavailable, tetracyclines are recommended. Doxycycline is the antimicrobial of choice. Cats with severe B bronchiseptica infection require supportive therapy and intensive nursing care. Vaccination recommendations: In some European countries an intranasal modified-live virus vaccine is available. The modified-live product is licensed for use as a single vaccination with annual boosters. Cats should not be routinely vaccinated against B bronchiseptica (non-core), since the infection generally causes only a mild disease. © 2009 ESFM and AAFP.",

In most cats, FHV remains latent after recovery, and they become lifelong virus carriers. Stress or corticosteroid treatment may lead to virus reactivation and shedding in oronasal and conjunctival secretions. Infection: Sick cats shed FHV in oral, nasal and conjunctival secretions; shedding may last for 3 weeks. Infection requires direct contact with a shedding cat. Disease signs: Feline herpesvirus infections cause acute rhinitis and conjunctivitis, usually accompanied by fever, depression and anorexia. Affected cats may also develop typical ulcerative, dendritic keratitis. Diagnosis: Samples consist of conjunctival, corneal or oropharyngeal swabs, corneal scrapings or biopsies. It is not recommended that cats recently vaccinated with a modified-live virus vaccine are sampled. Positive PCR results should be interpreted with caution, as they may be produced by low-level shedding or viral latency. Disease management: 'Tender loving care' from the owner, supportive therapy and good nursing are essential. Anorexic cats should be fed blended, highly palatable food - warmed up if required. Mucolytic drugs (eg, bromhexine) or nebulisation with saline may offer relief. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given to prevent secondary bacterial infections. Topical antiviral drugs may be used for the treatment of acute FHV ocular disease. The virus is labile and susceptible to most disinfectants, antiseptics and detergents. Vaccination recommendations: Two injections, at 9 and 12 weeks of age, are recommended, with a first booster 1 year later. Boosters should be given annually to at-risk cats. For cats in low-risk situations (eg, indoor-only cats), 3-yearly intervals suffice. Cats that have recovered from FHV-associated disease are usually not protected for life against further disease episodes; vaccination of recovered cats is therefore recommended. © 2009 ESFM and AAFP.",

More severe, systemic forms of FCV infection have been observed recently. Infection: Sick, acutely infected or carrier cats shed FCV in oronasal and conjunctival secretions. Infection occurs mainly through direct contact. Disease signs: The main clinical signs are oral ulcers, upper respiratory signs and a high fever. Feline calicivirus may be isolated from nearly all cats with chronic stomatitis or gingivitis. Cats with 'virulent systemic FCV disease' variably show pyrexia, cutaneous oedema, ulcerative lesions on the head and limbs, and jaundice. Mortality is high and the disease is more severe in adult cats. Diagnosis: Diagnosis of FCV can be achieved by virus isolation or reverse-transcriptase PCR. Viral RNA can be detected in conjunctival and oral swabs, blood, skin scrapings or lung tissue using PCR. Positive PCR results should be interpreted with caution, as these may be a consequence of low-level shedding by persistently infected carriers. The diagnosis of virulent systemic FCV disease relies on clinical signs and isolation of the same strain from the blood of several diseased cats. Disease management: Supportive therapy (including fluid therapy) and good nursing care are essential. Anorexic cats should be fed highly palatable, blended or warmed food. Mucolytic drugs (eg, bromhexine) or nebulisation with saline may offer relief. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be administered to prevent secondary bacterial infections. Feline calicivirus can persist in the environment for about 1 month and is resistant to many common disinfectants. Vaccination recommendations: Two injections, at 9 and 12 weeks of age, are recommended, followed by a first booster 1 year later. In high-risk situations, a third vaccination at 16 weeks is recommended. Boosters should be given every 3 years. However, cats in high-risk situations should be revaccinated annually. Cats that have recovered from caliciviral disease are probably not protected for life, particularly if infected with different strains. Vaccination of these cats is still recommended. © 2009.",

Over the past 25 years, the prevalence of FeLV infection has decreased considerably, thanks both to reliable tests for the identification of viraemic carriers and to effective vaccines. Infection: Transmission between cats occurs mainly through friendly contacts, but also through biting. In large groups of non-vaccinated cats, around 30-40% will develop persistent viraemia, 30-40% show transient viraemia and 20-30% seroconvert. Young kittens are especially susceptible to FeLV infection. Disease signs: The most common signs of persistent FeLV viraemia are immune suppression, anaemia and lymphoma. Less common signs are immune-mediated disease, chronic enteritis, reproductive disorders and peripheral neuropathies. Most persistently viraemic cats die within 2-3 years. Diagnosis: In low-prevalence areas there may be a risk of false-positive results; a doubtful positive test result in a healthy cat should therefore be confirmed, preferably by PCR for provirus. Asymptomatic FeLV-positive cats should be retested. Disease management: Supportive therapy and good nursing care are required. Secondary infections should be treated promptly. Cats infected with FeLV should remain indoors. Vaccination against common pathogens should be maintained. Inactivated vaccines are recommended. The virus does not survive for long outside the host. Vaccination recommendations: All cats with an uncertain FeLV status should be tested prior to vaccination. All healthy cats at potential risk of exposure should be vaccinated against FeLV. Kittens should be vaccinated at 8-9 weeks of age, with a second vaccination at 12 weeks, followed by a booster 1 year later. The ABCD suggests that, in cats older than 3-4 years of age, a booster every 2-3 years suffices, in view of the significantly lower susceptibility of older cats. © 2009 ESFM and AAFP.",

Methods: Prospective study. Arthrocentesis was performed under sedation on 4 joints (both carpi, 1 tarsus, 1 stifle) on each dog every 3 weeks, a total of 4 times. Automated cell counts were done on stifle fluid, smears were made, and differential cell counts done on smears from all joints.

Causative mutations have been identified in the Maine Coon (MC) and Ragdoll breed in the cardiac myosin binding protein C gene (MYBPC3). HCM is thought to be inherited in other breeds. Hypothesis: That a causative mutation for HCM in the British Shorthair (BSH), Norwegian Forest (NWF), Siberian, Sphynx, or MC cats would be identified in the exonic and splice site regions of 1 of 8 genes associated with human familial HCM. Animals: Three affected BSH, NWF, Siberians, Sphynx, 2 MC (without the known MC mutation), and 2 Domestic Shorthair cats (controls) were studied. Methods: Prospective, observational study. Exonic and splice site regions of the genes encoding the proteins cardiac troponin I, troponin T, MYBPC3, cardiac essential myosin light chain, cardiac regulatory myosin light chain, α tropomyosin, actin, and β-myosin heavy chain were sequenced. Sequences were compared for nucleotide changes between affected cats, the published DNA sequences, and control cats. Changes were considered to be causative for HCM if they involved a conserved amino acid and changed the amino acid to a different polarity, acid-base status, or structure. Results: A causative mutation for HCM was not identified, although several single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Mutations within these cardiac genes do not appear to be the only cause of HCM in these breeds.

Diagnosis is based on the development of persistent azotemia with inadequate urine concentrating ability. Biomarkers are sought for early identification. Hypothesis: Clinical variables, urine concentrating ability, proteinuria, and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) index will be predictive of cats at risk of developing azotemia within 12 months. Animals: Client-owned nonazotemic geriatric (≥9 years) cats. Methods: Prospective longitudinal cohort study monitoring a population of healthy nonazotemic geriatric cats every 6 months until development of azotemia, death, or the study end point (September 30, 2007). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess baseline clinical, biochemical, and urinalysis variables, urine protein to creatinine ratio (UP/C), urine albumin to creatinine (UA/C) ratio, and urinary NAG index as predictors of development of azotemia. Results: One hundred and eighteen cats were recruited with a median age of 13 years. Ninety-five cats (80.5%) had been followed or reached the study end point by 12 months of which 30.5% (29/95) developed azotemia. Age, systolic blood pressure, plasma creatinine concentration, urine specific gravity, UP/C, UA/C, and NAG index were significantly associated with development of azotemia in the univariable analysis (P ≥ 05). However, in the multivariable analysis, only plasma creatinine concentration with either UP/C (Model 1) or UA/C (Model 2) remained significant. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: This study demonstrates a high incidence of azotemia in a population of previously healthy geriatric cats.

Dogs in group T first received the test diet and then the control diet, whereas dogs in group C were fed the diets in the opposite order. Different variables (body weight, body condition score, HE score, fecal score, CBC, plasma tests of liver function including NH3, and coagulation tests) were measured at the start of the study and after completion of each diet. Results: One-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed. Plasma NH3 was significantly lower after the test diet than after the control diet. The test diet also resulted in significantly higher fibrinogen concentrations and lower prothrombin times. The HE score improved with both diets, with no significant difference between the 2 diets. Conclusions: Both diets achieved a significant improvement in HE score. The influence of the soy-based diet on plasma NH3 concentration and coagulation parameters suggests that such a diet decreases the risk for HE and gives better support of liver function. © 2009 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Clinical chemistry; Clinical pathology; Coagulation; Hepatic function; Nutrition"

The integration of amplification and signal detection systems, including online real-time devices, have increased speed and sensitivity and greatly facilitated the quantification of target nucleic acids. They have also allowed for sequence characterization using melting or hybridization curves. The newer-generation molecular diagnostic technologies offer, hitherto, unparalleled detection and discrimination methodologies, which are vital for the positive detection and identification of pathogenic agents, as well as the effects of the pathogens on the production of antibodies. The development phase of the novel technologies entails a thorough understanding of accurate diagnosis and discrimination of present and emerging diseases. The development of novel technologies can only be successful if they are transferred and used in the field with a sustainable quality-assured application to allow for the optimal detection and effective control of diseases. The aim of these new tools is to detect the presence of a pathogen agent before the onset of disease.

Although USG has been shown to have a linear correlation with UOsm in dogs, the relationship is altered when there are significant numbers of high molecular weight (MW) molecules in the urine. Hypothesis: USG would no longer predict UOsm in dogs given intravenous hetastarch (670/0.75)(HES). Animals: Eight healthy employee-owned adult dogs. Methods: Prospective, controlled experimental study. USG and UOsm were measured every 30 minutes from t=0 minutes to t=360 minutes. Dogs were administered 20mL/kg of either NaCl 0.9% (control group, n=4) or HES (treatment group, n=8) IV over 1 hour starting at t=90 minutes. Results: There was a decrease in UOsm in both groups starting at t=120 minutes and continuing for the study duration, and there was no significant difference in UOsm between treatment and control groups across all time points. There was an appropriate decrease in USG from t=120 minutes for the control group. In the treatment group, USG increased significantly at t=120 minutes (P = .0006), t=150 minutes (P = .0002), and t=180 minutes (P = .0044). The largest increase in USG occurred at t=150 minutes with a mean USG of 1.070 ± 0.021 (range 1.038-1.104). Conclusions and clinical importance: Urine specific gravity should not be used to estimate urine solute concentration in dogs following the administration of 20mL/kg of HES.

However, the close correlation between genotype and phenotype (left ventricular hypertrophy [LVH] and dysfunction) has never been assessed in a large population, particularly in heterozygous (Hetero) cats. Objectives: To investigate LV morphology and function with echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) in a population of Maine Coon cats tested for the MyBPC3-A31P mutation with focus on Hetero animals. Animals: Ninety-six Maine Coon cats. Methods: Prospective observational study. Cats were screened for the MyBPC3-A31P mutation and examined with both echocardiography and 2-dimensional color TDI. Results: Fifty-two out of 96 cats did not have the mutation (wild-type genotype, Homo WT), 38/96 and 6/96 were Hetero- and homozygous-mutated (Homo M) cats, respectively. Only 11% of Hetero cats (4/38) had LVH and 29% (10/34) of Hetero cats without LVH were > 4 years old (4.1-11.5 years). LVH was also detected in 2 Homo WT cats (4%). A significantly decreased (P <.05) longitudinal E/A (ratio between early and late diastolic myocardial velocities) in the basal segment of the interventricular septum was observed in Hetero cats without LVH (n = 34) compared with Homo WT cats without LVH (n = 50), thus confirming that the Hetero status is associated with regional diastolic dysfunction (P <.05). Conclusions: The heterozygous status is not consistently associated with LVH and major myocardial dysfunction. Moreover, Homo WT cats can also develop LVH, suggesting that other genetic causes might be implicated.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate thromboelastography (TEG) and prothombinase-induced clotting time (PiCT) assays for detecting hemostatic alterations following in vitro heparinization of canine whole blood with dalteparin (Fragmin). Methods: Citrated whole-blood samples were collected from 7 clinically healthy dogs. Dalteparin was added at concentrations of 0, 0.156, 0.625, 1.25, and 2.5U/mL of whole blood. TEG was performed using heparinase cups with tissue factor (TF, 1:50,000) and kaolin as activators. Reaction time (R), clotting time (K), angle (α), and maximum amplitude (MA) were recorded. PiCT and anti-FXa activity were measured in plasma. Results: With TF, increasing concentrations of dalteparin significantly prolonged R and K and significantly decreased α and MA. K, α, and MA ratios were significantly different from baseline at all dalteparin concentrations and R was significantly different from baseline at concentrations of 0.625, 1.25, and 2.5U/mL. With kaolin, only R was significantly different from baseline at dalteparin concentrations of 0.625 and 2.5 U/mL. PiCT detected dalteparin concentrations ≤ 0.625 U/mL, with a good linear correlation (r2 = 96, P &lt;.0001). Conclusion: These results suggest that TF-activated TEG and PiCT assays should be further evaluated as promising new methods for evaluating the effect of LMWH, using doses in the recommended clinical range and prospective clinical studies. © 2008 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.","Anti-xa; Assay; Dog; Low-molecular-weight heparin; Thromboelastography"

In humans, surgical outcome has improved with the use of phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) before adrenalectomy. Hypothesis: Dogs treated with PBZ before adrenalectomy have increased survival compared with untreated dogs. Animals: Forty-eight dogs that underwent adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma. Methods: A retrospective medical record review for dogs that underwent adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma at a veterinary medical teaching hospital over the period from January 1986 through December 2005. Results: Twenty-three of 48 dogs were pretreated with PBZ (median dosage: 0.6 mg/kg PO q12h) for a median duration of 20 days before adrenalectomy. Duration of anesthesia and surgery, percentage of dogs with pheochromocytoma involving the right versus left adrenal gland, size of tumor, and presence of vascular invasion were similar for PBZ-treated and untreated dogs. Thirty-three (69%) of 48 dogs survived adrenalectomy in the perioperative period. PBZ-treated dogs had a significantly (P = .014) decreased mortality rate compared with untreated dogs (13 versus 48%, respectively). Additional significant prognostic factors for improved survival included younger age (P = .028), lack of intraoperative arrhythmias (P = .0075), and decreased surgical time (P = .0089).

In the dog, there are 2 polymorphic CAG repeat (CAGr) regions. Objective: To investigate the relationship of CAGr length of the canine AR-gene and the development of PC. Animals: Thirty-two dogs with PC and 172 control dogs were used. Methods: DNA was extracted from blood. Both CAG repeats were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR products were sequenced. Results: In dogs with PC, CAG-1 repeat length was shorter (P = .001) by an increased proportion of 10 repeats (P = .011) and no 12 repeats (P = .0017) than in the control dogs. No significant changes were found in CAG-3 length distribution. CAG-1 and CAG-3 polymorphisms proved not to be in linkage disequilibrium. Breed difference in allelic distribution was found in the control group. Of the prostate-disease sensitive breeds, a high percentage (64.5%) of the shortest haplotype 10/11 was found in the Doberman, whereas Beagles and German Pointers had higher haplotype 12/11 (47.1 and 50%). Bernese Mountain dogs and Bouvier dogs both shared a high percentage of 11 CAG-1 repeats and 13 CAG-3 repeats. Differences in (combined) allelic distributions among breeds were not significant. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: In this preliminary study, short CAG-1 repeats in the AR-gene were associated with an increased risk of developing canine PC. Although breed-specific differences in allelic distribution of CAG-1 and CAG-3 repeats were found, these could not be related to PC risk.

Objective: To determine if auditory abnormalities occur in horses with THO. Animals: Eleven diseased and 8 control horses. Methods: This is a prospective study in which brainstem auditory-evoked responses (BAER) were recorded in 11 horses diagnosed with THO through neurologic, endoscopic, radiographic, or computed tomographic examinations. BAER findings were compared with those recorded from 8 adult control horses. Results: All horses with THO were found to have BAER abnormalities that included complete unilateral BAER loss (82%, n = 9/11), partial unilateral BAER loss (18%, n = 2/11) on the most affected side, and contralateral partial BAER loss (46%, n = 5/11). Nine horses had bilateral THO based on diagnostic imaging findings; of these. 5 (56%) horses also had bilateral BAER abnormalities.

However, their effects on asymptomatic heart disease remain controversial. Hypothesis: Benazepril (BNZ), an ACEI, could have beneficial effects at the asymptomatic stage of degenerative mitral valve disease (MVD). Animals: Dogs with ISACHC class Ia MVD and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) assessed by the color Doppler mapping technique at entry (Day 0) were retrospectively included. Methods: Dogs were assigned to the treated group (BNZ group) if they received BNZ (and no other cardiac medication) from Day 0 or to the untreated group (UT group) if they did not receive any cardioactive treatment until occurrence of CHF. Results: A total of 141 dogs were included in the study, 66 in the BNZ group (dosage: 0.30 ± 0.13 mg/kg) and 75 in the UT group. In the population (n = 93) including all breeds except Cavalier (CKC) and King Charles Spaniels (KC), median survival time to all causes of death in the BNZ group (n = 34, 3.3 years) was significantly longer than in the UT group (n = 59, 1.9 years) as was time to cardiac event (P < .05). Conversely, no effect of the BNZ treatment was observed in the CKC and KC population. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: BNZ had beneficial effects in asymptomatic dogs other than CKC and KC affected by MVD with moderate-to-severe MR.

Clinical findings, clinicopathologic data, and treatment of these tumors have been reported sporadically, but little information is available regarding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, histologic tumor grade, or efficacy of radiation therapy as an adjunct to cytoreductive surgery. Animals: Dogs with histologically confirmed intraspinal meningiomas (n = 34). Methods: A retrospective study of dogs with intraspinal meningiomas between 1984 and 2006 was carried out. Signalment, historical information, physical examination, clinicopathologic data, radiation therapy protocols, surgery reports, and all available images were reviewed. All tumors were histologically classified and graded as defined by the international World Health Organization classification scheme for central nervous system tumors. Results: Intraspinal mengiomas in dogs are most common in the cervical spinal cord but can be found throughout the neuraxis. Location is correlated with histologic grade, with grade I tumors more likely to be in the cervical region than grade II tumors. Myelography generally shows an intradural extramedullary compressive lesion. On magnetic resonance imaging, the masses are strongly and uniformly contrast enhancing and a dural tail often is present. CSF analysis usually shows increased protein concentration with mild to moderate mixed pleocytosis. Surgical resection is an effective means of improving neurologic status, and adjunctive radiation therapy may lead to an improved outcome. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Biopsy is necessary for definitive diagnosis, but imaging and CSF analysis can suggest a diagnosis of meningioma. Treatment of meningiomas with surgery and radiation therapy can result in a fair to excellent prognosis.

However, we have observed a moderate to marked pleocytosis with a predominance of lymphocytes in some dogs with IVDH. Hypothesis: Moderate to marked CSF pleocytosis occurs more commonly in dogs with type I IVDH than is reported in the literature. Lymphocytic predominance is more common than nonlymphocytic pleocytosis in dogs with chronic IVDH. Animals: Four hundred twenty-three client-owned dogs with type I IVDH. Methods: Retrospective study. Lumbar CSF of dogs with surgically confirmed type I IVDH was evaluated cytologically. Information obtained from medical records included signalment, prior clinical history, time from onset of signs to presentation, neurologic status, and intraoperative findings. Dogs with prior history and/or intraoperative evidence consistent with chronic IVDH before an acute herniation were termed acute-on-chronic (AOC). Results: Pleocytosis (> 5 cells/uL) was present in 51 % of dogs, including 23 % with cervical IVDH and 61 % with thoracolumbar IVDH. Moderate or marked inflammation (≥ 20cells/uL) was identified in the CSF of 51% of dogs with thoracolumbar IVDH and pleocytosis. A predominance of lymphocytes was significantly more common in dogs examined > 7 days from onset of signs (P = .032) and in dogs with AOC IVDH (P = .0013). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Moderate to marked CSF pleocytosis in dogs with type I IVDH is more common than previously reported. Lymphocytic pleocytosis is most common in dogs with chronic progression or AOC IVDH. Lymphocytic inflammation in the CSF of some dogs might suggest an immune-mediated response to chronically herniated disc material.

The long history of collaborative teaching and research between the schools, as well as the university's close proximity to and relationship with numerous university-affiliated and state public-health agencies, has created remarkable opportunities for novel and creative public-health education. The university is already anticipating the approval of a School of Public Health on its campus, which will create even more educational opportunities in both human and veterinary public-health disciplines. Given the projected shortfall of veterinarians entering such fields, the opportunity of a novel Doctor of Public Health degree program specifically suited to the needs of veterinary medicine is also discussed as a means of addressing this shortage. © 2008 AAVMC.","DrPH; Epidemiology; Public health; Veterinary medical education; Veterinary public health"

Objectives: To describe the physical examination, clinicopathologic, histopathologic, and radiographic features and response to corticosteroid treatment of idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia of horses. Animals: Seven horses with eosinophilic pneumonia. Methods: Retrospective, descriptive study. Results: Anamnesis, clinical signs, and clinicopathologic and radiologic findings in 7 adult horses with histologically confirmed eosinophilic pneumonia were reviewed. The horses were examined for signs of chronic respiratory disease. The horses ranged in age from 8 to 20 years. Significant findings on physical examination included tachypnea and abnormal respiratory sounds. Thoracic radiography revealed severe diffuse interstitial patterns of increased pulmonary density in all horses. There was a predominance of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and 6 of 7 horses had peripheral blood eosinophilia. Lung biopsies revealed eosinophilic infiltrates in all horses. Dexamethasone was administered to 3 horses and resulted in short-term clinical improvement in all three. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: A diagnosis of idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia should be considered in horses with a history of chronic pulmonary disease, diffuse interstitial pattern of increased pulmonary density on thoracic radiographs, and a predominance of eosinophils in BALF. Horses with this condition may show a temporary response to treatment with dexamethasone.

Hypothesis: The objectives were to develop a noninvasive method of electrode placement for recording the EEG in horses and to establish normal EEG parameters for the various states of vigilance. Findings are compared with previously published reports on equine sleep based on electrocorticography (ECoG). Animals: Five neurologically normal horses. Methods: Overnight EEGs were recorded digitally in association with simultaneous videotaping of the horses' behavior. Data were analyzed by visual inspection, states of vigilance were identified, and representative segments were quantitatively processed. Transient EEG events were examined. Results: Slow wave sleep (SWS) was significantly different (P < .05) in frequency and power from drowsiness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Second-degree heart block was associated with SWS as were transient events commonly recognized in EEGs of humans. Drowsiness and REM sleep were similar. In both, background activity was low-amplitude β activity admixed with prominent activity of approximately 4 Hz. Standing REM sleep was associated with numerous partial collapses in 1 horse. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Normative data for several states were described and probable benign variants identified. This information will serve as control data for sedative and anesthetic studies in this species. The sleep patterns observed during this study are those of horses removed from their usual surroundings, and thus may represent those encountered in a clinical environment.

Hypothesis: Systolic dysfunction (SyD) may be observed in dogs with mitral valve disease (MVD) and is better assessed by PM than GM, which does not take into account the longitudinal left ventricular systolic shortening. Animals: Six healthy dogs were used to determine the variability of the tested variables (Study 1). These variables were then prospectively assessed (Study 2) in 101 small breed dogs: 77 dogs with MVD and 24 healthy controls (CD). Methods: ESVI was measured by GM and PM in awake dogs. Results: All within- and between-day coefficients of variation were <11% (Study 1). For Study 2, a nonlinear overestimation of ESVI was observed by GM compared with PM. PM-derived ESVI was significantly increased in ISACHC class 3 dogs compared with ISACHC class 1 dogs and exerted a significant influence on cardiac events at 5 months in dogs with MVD from ISACHC classes 2 and 3 (P < .05). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: ESVI can be calculated by GM and PM with good repeatability and reproducibility. However, GM overestimates ESVI in a nonlinear way. Therefore, PM-derived ESVI should be preferred for the detection of SyD that is present at the late stages of the disease.

Classification of meningiomas by tumor grade and subtype has not been reported, and the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics for predicting tumor subtype and grade has not been investigated. Hypothesis: Canine intracranial meningiomas are a heterogenous group of tumors with differing histological subtypes and grades. Prediction of histopathological classification is possible based on MRI characteristics. Animals: One hundred and twelve dogs with a histological diagnosis of intracranial meningioma. Methods: Retrospective observational study. Results: Meningiomas were overrepresented in the Golden Retriever and Boxer breeds with no sex predilection. The incidence of specific tumor grades was 56% benign (Grade I), 43% atypical (Grade II), and 1% malignant (Grade III). Grade I histological subtypes included meningothelial (43%), transitional (40%), microcystic (8%), psammomatous (6%), and angiomatous (3%). No statistically significant (P < .05) associations were found among tumor subtype or grade and any of the MRI features studied. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Meningiomas in dogs differ from their counterparts in humans mainly in their higher incidence of atypical (Grade II) tumors observed. MRI characteristics do not allow for prediction of meningioma subtype or grade, emphasizing the necessity of histopathology for antemortem diagnosis. The higher incidence of atypical tumors in dogs may contribute to the poorer therapeutic response in dogs with meningiomas as compared with the response in humans with meningiomas.

Increased concentrations of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) are implicated. Hypothesis: Plasma ADMA concentration is increased in cats with CKD and systemic hypertension corresponding to a decrease in total plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) availability. Decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and proteinuria during treatment of hypertension with amlodipine besylate may be associated with increased NOx availability. Animals: Sixty-nine client-owned normotensive and hypertensive cats with variable azotemia. Methods: Plasma ADMA, symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), and L-arginine were measured simultaneously by hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry in cats from 6 groups: normotensive nonazotemic (n = 10), normotensive mildly azotemic (n = 10), hypertensive mildly azotemic with hypertensive retinopathy (n = 20), hypertensive mildly azotemic without hypertensive retinopathy (n = 10), normotensive moderately azotemic cats (n = 10), and hypertensive nonazotemic cats (n = 9). Plasma NOx concentrations were measured. Results: A moderate correlation between plasma creatinine and ADMA (n = 69, r = .608, P &lt; .001), SDMA (n = 69, r = .741, P &lt; .001), and NOx concentrations (n = 69, r = .589, P &lt; .001) was observed. There was no association among plasma ADMA, SDMA, and NO x concentrations and SBP. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Plasma ADMA and SDMA concentrations are increased in cats with CKD and correlate with plasma creatinine concentration. This may imply the presence of endothelial dysfunction in cats with CKD. Plasma ADMA concentrations were not associated with systemic hypertension. Treatment of systemic hypertension with amlodipine besylate did not affect plasma ADMA or NOx concentrations.

Hypothesis: A statistically derived scoring system can accurately predict outcome in dogs with AKI managed with hemodialysis. Animals: One hundred and eighty-two client-owned dogs with AKI. Methods: Logistic regression analyses were performed initially on clinical variables available on the 1st day of hospitalization for relevance to outcome. Variables with P < .1 were considered for further analyses. Continuous variables outside the reference range were divided into quartiles to yield quartile-specific odds ratios (ORs) for survival. Models were developed by incorporating weighting factors assigned to each quartile based on the OR, using either the integer value of the OR (Model A) or the exact OR (Models B or C, when the etiology was known). A predictive score for each model was calculated for each dog by summing all weighting factors. In Model D, actual values for continuous variables were used in a logistic regression model. Receiver-operating curve analyses were performed to assess sensitivities, specificities, and optimal cutoff points for all models. Results: Higher scores were associated with decreased probability of survival (P < .001). Models A, B, C, and D correctly classified outcomes in 81, 83, 87, and 76% of cases, respectively, and optimal sensitivities/ specificities were 77/85, 81/85, 83/90 and 92/61%, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: The models allowed outcome prediction that corresponded with actual outcome in our cohort. However, each model should be validated further in independent cohorts. The models may also be useful to assess AKI severity. Copyright © 2008 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Acute renal failure; Canine; Risk factors; Score; Survival"

However, it has never been assessed in the awake dog, because magnetic resonance imaging and sonomicrometry have been the only methods available so far. Hypothesis: Two dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (STE), a new ultrasound imaging technique, provides a repeatable and reproducible noninvasive assessment of systolic LV wringing motion in the awake dog. Animals: Six healthy dogs were used to determine the repeatability and reproducibility of STE variables (study 1). These variables also were prospectively assessed in a population of 35 healthy dogs (study 2). Methods: Peak LV basal and apical systolic rotations were measured by STE from right parasternal short-axis views using automatic frame-to-frame tracking of gray-scale speckle patterns. Systolic LV torsion (LVtor, °) was defined as apical rotation relative to the base. Results: All within-day and between-day coefficients of variation were &lt;20% (6.8-18.0%). Amplitude of apical systolic rotation was significantly higher (P &lt; .001) than the basal value (5.4 ± 3.2° and -3.1 ± 1.3°, respectively). Global LVtor was significantly correlated with systolic longitudinal LV myocardial velocity gradient assessed by tissue Doppler (P &lt; .05), but not with either systolic radial LV myocardial velocity gradient or the ratio of early mitral inflow velocity to early mitral annular velocity (Em/Ea). Conclusions and clinical importance: Speckle tracking echocardiography is a repeatable and reproducible method for assessing systolic LV torsional deformation. The combination of these new STE indices with tissue Doppler variables could provide a new approach for quantifying canine LV systolic function.

Spironolactone (SPIR) reduces myocardial fibrosis in several models of HCM and in humans with cardiac disease. Hypothesis: SPIR will improve diastolic function and reduce left ventricular (LV) mass in Maine Coon cats with HCM. Methods: Maine Coon cats with familial HCM were included if there was concentric hypertrophy (≥6 mm end diastolic wall thickness) and decreased early lateral mitral annular velocity (Em) or summated early and late mitral annular velocity (EAsum) measured by pulsed wave tissue Dopplet imaging echocardiography. Cats were paired by Em-EAsum and randomized to receive 2 mg/kg SPIR (n = 13) or placebo (n = 13) PO q12 h for 4 months. Em-EAsum, systolic velocity, LV mass, and the ratio of left atrial to aortic diameter were measured at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. Statistical analysis included 2-way repeated measures analysis of variance and the Student's t-test. Results: Plasma aldosterone concentration increased in cats treated with SPIR (235 ng/mL, baseline; 935 ng/mL, 2 months; 1,077 μg/mL, 4 months; P < .001 at 2 and 4 months). No significant treatment effect was identified for early or early-late summated diastolic mitral annular velocity or any other variable except plasma aldosterone concentration. Severe facial ulcerative dermatitis developed in 4 of 13 cats treated with SPIR, requiring discontinuation of the drug. Conclusion: SPIR did not improve Em or EAsum of the lateral mitral annulus or alter LV mass over 4 months. One third of cats treated with SPIR developed severe ulcerative facial dermatitis.

Objectives: To determine treatment outcome and identify prognostic variables in order to define areas of future research. Animals: One hundred forty-nine dogs with hematocrit < 30% and either a positive Coombs' test or spherocytosis and with no evidence of disease that can trigger IMHA were included. Methods: Retrospective cohort study. All dogs were treated with prednisolone and azathioprine according to a standard protocol. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Variables recorded at the time of diagnosis were tested as possible prognostic variables in a univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Results: The main predictors for mortality in dogs with idiopathic IMHA are the presence of increased plasma urea concentration, bands, thrombocytopenia, and petechiae at the time of diagnosis. The estimated Kaplan-Meier half-year survival was 72.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64.9-81.3%). Mortality occurred mostly within the 1st 2 weeks. Cox proportional hazards analysis indicated that increased plasma urea concentration, icterus, and petechiae were the major independent predictors of mortality in the 1st 2 weeks. In most dogs that survived IMHA, a 3-month protocol of azathioprine with prednisolone maintained clinical remission. The estimated half-year survival for dogs that survived the 1st 2 weeks was 92.5% (95% CI: 86-99.3%). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: If the dogs survived IMHA, a 3-month protocol of prednisolone and azathioprine was effective with regard to survival and clinical outcome. Future research should be directed at identifying whether thrombotic tendency in dogs with IMHA is the main contributor to the development of increased plasma urea concentration, icterus, thrombocytopenia, and petechiae.

Objectives: To characterize the overall hemostatic state in dogs with DIC, by use of tissue factor-activated thromboelastography (TF-TEG), and to determine whether there is an association between hemostasis and outcome. Animals: 50 dogs with DIC. Methods: Dogs admitted to the intensive care units, with an underlying disease known to predispose to DIC, were prospectively assessed with TF-TEG. Citrated blood samples were collected daily during hospitalization and an extended coagulation panel and TF-TEG were performed. Diagnosis of DIC was based on expert opinion. Results: Hemostatic dysfunction was observed on the TF-TEG profile in 33/50 of the dogs, of which 22/50 were hypercoagulable and 11/50 were hypocoagulable based on the TF-TEG G value alone. There were significant differences in k, α, and MA values (P < .0001) among hypo-, normo-, and hypercoagulable dogs. There was a significant difference in case fatality rate between hypo- (64%) and hypercoagulable (32%) dogs (relative risk = 2,38; P = .04). Dogs that died had significantly lower antithrombin activity (P = .03) and higher D-dimer concentration (P = .03) than survivors. Conclusions: The most common overall hemostatic abnormality in dogs diagnosed with DIC was hypercoagulability, and there was significant difference in survival between hyper- and hypocoagulable dogs.

Hypothesis: The overall hemostatic functional state, including hypercoagulability, can be assessed in dogs with neoplasia by tissue factor (TF)-activated thromboelastography (TEG). Animals: Thirty-six dogs with malignant neoplasia and 13 dogs with benign neoplasia presented to the Small Animal Veterinary Teaching Hospital, The University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark. Methods: Prospective study evaluating the overall hemostatic functional state in dogs with neoplasia by a newly validated TF-activated TEG assay and routine coagulation parameters activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), platelet count, and D-dimer concentration. Results: Hemostatic dysfunction was observed in 28/49 (57%) dogs with neoplasia. Twenty-four were dogs with malignant neoplasia, the majority of which 18/36 (50%) were hypercoagulable, whereas 6/36 (17%) were hypocoagulable. All hypocoagulable dogs had metastatic disease. The proportion of dogs with altered hemostasis was significantly different between dogs with malignant and benign neoplasia. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: TF-activated TEG detected hypercoagulable and hypocoagulable states in this population of dogs with neoplasia. The most common hemostatic abnormality in dogs with malignant neoplasia was hypercoagulability. These findings suggest that this novel hemostatic function test may be of value as a cage side method for the assessment of overall hemostatic function in dogs with cancer, including the detection of both hyper- and hypocoagulable states as well as mixed disorders.

Hypothesis: Serum N-terminal fragment of proatrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) and NT-probrain natriuretic peptide (proBNP) concentrations may predict the presence of heart disease (HD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). A positive relationship is also predicted among natriuretic peptide (NP) concentrations, a noninvasive estimate of left ventricular filling pressure (E/Ea), and an echocardiographic measure of left atrial (LA) size (LA/aortic diameter [Ao]). Methods: Serum NP concentrations were measured in 28 healthy control and 50 study cats using sandwich enzyme immunoassays. The study group comprised cats, with HD but no CHF (HD - CHF, n = 17) and cats with CHF (HD + CHF, n = 33). The relationship among NP concentrations, LA size, and E/Ea was examined. The ability of NP to distinguish control from study cats, and HD - CHF from HD + CHF cats, was explored using receiver operator curve analysis. Results: NP concentrations were significantly lower in control than in study cats (P = .0001). The NT-proBNP concentrations were positively correlated with LA/Ao ratio (p = 0.34; P = .02) and with E/Ea ratio (ρ = 0.68; P &lt; .05). An NT-proBNP concentration of 49 fmol/mL gave a sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 89.3%, respectively, for correctly distinguishing 96.2% of control from study cats. Pairwise comparisons of the areas under the curve identified a statistically significant difference (P = .011) between NT-proANP and NT-proBNP to distinguish control from study cats. NT-proANP and NT-proBNP concentrations were significantly higher in HD + CHF cats than in HD - CHF cats (P = .0023 and .0001, respectively). Conclusions: Serum concentrations of NT-proANP and particularly NT-proBNP were different in healthy control cats, asymptomatic cats with HD, and cats with CHF, suggesting that measurement of NP concentrations may prove clinically useful as an initial screening test for cats with suspected cardiac disease.

Cardiac arrhythmias were reported in a retrospective study of V. palaestinae envenomations in dogs. Hypothesis: Cardiac arrhythmias in V. palaestinae-envenomed dogs are associated with myocardial injury reflected by increased serum concentrations of cardiac troponins (cTns). Animals: Forty-eight client-owned dogs envenomed by V. palaestinae. Methods: Blood sampling (serum biochemistry and cTns, CBC, and coagulation tests) and electrocardiography were performed periodically up to 72 hours postenvenomation. Cardiac rhythm strips were assessed blindly for the presence and type of arrhythmias. Results: Serum cTn-T and cTn-I concentrations were increased in 25% (n = 12) and 65% (n = 31) of the dogs at least once during hospitalization, respectively. Arrhythmias were identified in 29% (n = 14) of the dogs. Dogs with increased cTn-T had a significantly higher occurrence of arrhythmias (58 versus 19%), and higher resting heart rate upon admission and within the following 24 hours. Dogs with increased serum cTn-T concentrations were hospitalized for a significantly (P = .001) longer period compared to those with normal serum cTn-T concentrations. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Dogs envenomed by V. palaestinae appear to sustain some degree of myocardial injury, as reflected by increased serum cTn concentrations and by the occurrence of arrhythmias. The latter should alert clinicians to a potentially ongoing cardiac injury. An increase in cTn-T may be of clinical relevance and indicate a cardiac injury in V. palaestinae envenomations in dogs.

Cats are commonly anaesthetized in veterinary practice, but recent figures describing the frequency of or risk factors for anaesthetic-related death are not available. The aims of this study were to address these deficiencies. Methods. A nested case-control study was undertaken in 117 UK veterinary centres. All anaesthetic and sedation procedures and anaesthetic and sedation-related deaths (i.e. 'cases') occurring within 48 h were recorded. Details of patient, procedure, and perioperative management were recorded for all cases and randomly selected non-deaths (controls). A detailed statistical model of factors associated with anaesthetic and sedation-related death was constructed. Results. Between June 2002 and June 2004, 175 deaths were classified as anaesthetic and sedation-related and 14 additional deaths (with insufficient information to be excluded) were included for the estimation of risk. During the study, 79 178 anaesthetic and sedation procedures were recorded and the overall risk of anaesthetic and sedation-related death was 0.24% (95% CI 0.20-0.27). Factors associated with increased odds of anaesthetic-related death were poor health status (ASA physical status classification), increasing age, extremes of weight, increasing procedural urgency and complexity, endotracheal intubation, and fluid therapy. Pulse monitoring and pulse oximetry were associated with reduced odds. Conclusions. The risk of anaesthetic-related death in cats appears to have decreased since the last published study in the UK. The results should aid the preoperative identification of cats at greatest risk. Greater care with endotracheal intubation and fluid administration are recommended, and pulse and pulse oximetry monitoring should be routinely implemented in cats. © The Board of Management and Trustees of the British Journal of Anaesthesia 2007.

However, these are not always detectable. Hypothesis: Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), a novel noninvasive ultrasound technique, provides indirect but sensitive and specific assessment of elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) in dogs. Animals: One hundred and five dogs with TR. Methods: Prospective observational study. Dogs were categorized as presenting normal (group 1, n = 45), mildly increased (group 2, n = 19), or moderately to severely increased (group 3, n = 41) SPAP, based on TR peak velocities (<2.5, 2.5-3.0, and >3.0 m/s, respectively). Ten quantitative echo-Doppler- and TDI-derived variables were assessed, including the main pulmonary arterial diameter to aortic diameter ratio, pulmonary flow acceleration time, and acceleration-to-ejection time ratio, the Tei index of right ventricular function, and 6 longitudinal basal right ventricular TDI variables. Results: A significant correlation was observed between SPAP and each of the 10 tested variables (P < .05). Conventional echo-Doppler variables were less discriminating than the TDI for predicting increased SPAP. The combined systolic and diastolic right TDI index had the highest sensitivity and specificity (89% and 93% respectively, for a cutoff of 11.8 cm/s) and could discriminate between dogs in group 1 from dogs in group 2. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: TDI provided effective predictors of systolic PAH and demonstrated that both alterations in right-sided systolic and diastolic myocardial function can occur with mild increases in SPAP.

The utility of IGF-I as a screening test for acromegaly has not been critically evaluated. This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the usefulness of serum IGF-I concentration for identifying acromegaly. Hypothesis: Serum IGF-I is a useful screening test for acromegaly in diabetic cats. Animals: A review was made of the medical records of 74 diabetic cats that had serum IGF-I quantified. The diabetes was classified as well controlled (15 cats), poorly controlled because of problems with the insulin treatment regimen, concurrent disease, or both (40), or poorly controlled with clinical findings consistent with acromegaly (19). Methods: A review of medical records was made. Results: Serum IGF-I concentration was significantly (P < .0001) increased in acromegalic diabetic cats, compared with well-controlled and poorly controlled diabetic cats. Sensitivity and specificity for serum IGF-I concentration were 84% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 60.4-96.6%) and 92% (95% CI = 81.3-97.2%), respectively. There was no significant correlation between serum IGF-I concentration and duration of insulin treatment (r = 0.23, P = .089), insulin dosage (r = 0.14, P = .30), age (r = 0.16, P = .12), and pituitary volume (r = 0.40, P = .11), but a modest correlation was found between serum IGF-I concentration and body weight (r = 0.48, P < .0001). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Results support the use of serum IGF-I concentration as a screening test for acromegaly in diabetic cats that have clinical findings supportive of the disease.

However, circulating fluid volume largely determines diastolic cardiac chamber dimensions, and reduced diastolic volume in other species results in what has been called ""pseudohypertrophy of the ventricular myocardium."" Hypothesis: Altered hydration produces changes on 2D echocardiography that may confound the diagnosis or severity assessment of cardiomyopathy of cats. Animals: Ten normal colony-sourced mixed breed cats were included. Methods: Cats were examined by echocardiography at baseline and at completion of 3 protocols (volume depletion and maintenance-rate and anesthetic-rate IV fluid administration) applied in randomized crossover design with a 6-7 day washout period. Results: Volume depletion increased diastolic left ventricular interventricular septal (IVSd) and free wall diameter (4.5 ± 0.4 to 5.8 ± 0.6 mm; P < .001) with wall thickness exceeding 6 mm in 4 cats. Diastolic left ventricular internal diameter (LVIDd) decreased, and reduction in systolic left ventricular internal diameter (LVIDs) produced end-systolic cavity obliteration in 7 cats. Left-atrial-to-aortic-root ratio (LA : Ao, 1.4 ± 0.2 to 1.2 ± 0.1, P < .05) and left atrial area in diastole (LAAd) decreased with volume depletion. Maintenance-rate IV fluid administration increased LAAd and fractional shortening (FS%). Anesthetic-rate IV fluid administration increased LVIDd, FS%, LAAd, and LA: Ao ratios (to 1.7 ± 0.1, P < .01), producing an LA : Ao ratio above normal limits in 6 cats. A systolic heart murmur developed with administration of fluid at maintenance (n = 1) and anesthetic rates (n = 6). Conclusions: Altered hydration status produces changes in the echocardiographic examination of normal cats that may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of cardiomyopathy or mask its presence. Hydration status should be considered during echocardiographic examination in cats.

Few studies have critically evaluated the performance characteristics of commercially available immunoassays for detection of these organisms in the cat. Hypothesis: Human-based immunoassays are suboptimal for the detection of Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. in cats. Animals: Three-hundred-and-forty-four cats with diarrheic and nondiarrheic fecal specimens at 4 northern California animal shelters. Methods: A fecal specimen was collected from each cat in a case-controlled fashion. Fecal specimens were tested for Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. by using centrifugation flotation and 5 commercially available immunoassays (SNAP Giardia, ProSpecT Giardia Microplate Assay, ProSpecT Cryptosporidium Microplate Assay, ImmunoCard STAT! Cryptosporidiuml Giardia Rapid Assay, and Xpect Giardial Cryptosporidium). Results were compared with a reference standard, the MeriFluor direct immunofluorescence assay. Results: Overall prevalences of Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. were 9.8 and 4.7%, respectively. The ProSpecT Microplate Assay had the highest sensitivities and specificities for Giardia spp. (91.2 and 99.4%) and Cryptosporidum spp. (71.4 and 96.7%), respectively. The SNAP Giardia antigen assay was easier to use and equally sensitive (85.3%) and specific (100%) to fecal flotation. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Caution should be exercised when using human-based immunoassays for the diagnosis of Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. in cats. Fecal flotation remains a useful method for detection of Giardia spp., can be used to detect other parasites, and has a sensitivity of 97.8% for detection of Giardia spp. when combined with the SNAP Giardia immunoassay.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of feline T foetus isolates obtained from naturally infected cats to 5 antimicrobial agents and to compare the in vitro time kill of ronidazole and metronidazole. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that nitroimidazoles have in vitro activity against T foetus, whereas furazolidone, omeprazole, and paromomycin do not. Animals: Fecal specimens were cultured from 4 naturally infected Bengal cats with a history of T foetus-associated diarrhea. Methods: A 24-hour susceptibility assay was performed on all 4 isolates for the 5 antimicrobial agents. A time-kill microdilution method was performed on 2 isolates for metronidazole and ronidazole. Results: Paromomycin and omeprazole showed no in vitro effect at concentrations ≤80 μ/mL. There was no significant difference in 24-hour susceptibilities among metronidazole, ronidazole, and furazolidone. In addition, only the results of the highest concentration tested (80 μg/mL) and concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 μg/mL revealed significant differences in the rate of trophozoite killing, with ronidazole having a faster reduction in trophozoite survival. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Time-kill assays demonstrated ronidazole had a higher lethal activity compared with metronidazole. These findings contrast with a previously published report and may reflect strain variation, different methodologies, or both. The lack of clinical response seen with metronidazole administration to treat feline trichomoniasis may not reflect inherent resistance but rather in vivo events involving drug distribution and pharmacokinetics.

Hypothesis: Azotemia and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are more severe with increased severity of CVD. Animals: 124 (study No. 1) and 24 (study No. 2) client-owned dogs with CVD. Methods: A retrospective study (study No. 1) was performed to assess the prevalence of azotemia in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes of heart failure in dogs with CVD. A prospective study (study No. 2) was then designed to determine GFR in dogs with different degrees of CVD severity. Complete physical examination, electrocardiography, blood pressure measurement, thoracic radiographs, echocardiography, and plasma and urine analyses were also performed. Results: In study No. 1, 50% of the dogs were azotemic and the percentage of azotemic dogs increased with functional class (up to 70% in NYHA class IV patients). In study No. 2, 8/24 dogs were azotemic. Plasma urea and creatinine were higher in NYHA class III-IV dogs compared with class I-II dogs. The GFR was lower (P < .001) in NYHA class IH-IV dogs (1.7 ± 0.7 mL/min/kg) than in class I to II dogs (3.1 ± 0.8 mL/min/kg). Only 1 dog in class I-II had a GFR below 2 mL/min/kg and only 2/9 class III-IV dogs had a GFR above 2 mL/min/kg. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance: Azotemia and renal impairment increase with the severity of congestive heart failure and are frequent findings in dogs with CVD. It remains to be shown if deterioration of renal function is a direct result of progression of the heart disease.

Allowable imprecision and bias reference limits for analytical tests can be calculated based on measurements of biological variation. No studies to date have examined the effect of biological variation on these haemostasis parameters in the same group of dogs. Plasma samples were collected after a set protocol once weekly for five consecutive weeks from eight healthy dogs (four males and four females) and stored at -80 °C until analysis. Randomized duplicate coagulation tests and TEG analyses were performed on all plasma samples within one run. The data were analyzed for outliers and subsequently subjected to nested analysis of variance to obtain the coefficient of analytical, intra-individual and inter-individual variation. From these objective analytical performance standards for imprecision, critical difference, total error and the index of individuality were calculated to assess the utility of conventional population-based reference ranges. All the clotting times (aPTT, PT and TT), fibrinogen, AT and D-Dimer showed a degree of individuality, which may make the use of population-based reference ranges alone an insensitive interpretation criterion, whereas a population-based reference interval seems to be sensitive for interpreting all TEG parameters. Analytical performance standards for imprecision were only met for one of the coagulation assays, whereas all TEG parameters except the alpha angle, α achieved this analytical goal. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of TDI and St features in dogs with overt DCM is a prerequisite before using these new criteria in prospective screenings of predisposed families or in clinical trials. Hypothesis: Radial and longitudinal right and left myocardial motion, assessed by TDI and St variables, is altered in dogs with DCM. Animals: Case records for 26 dogs; 14 with DCM and 12 healthy controls of comparable age and weight were reviewed. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of conventional echocardiography, 2-dimensional color TDI, and St imaging data. Results: The DCM group was characterized by decreases in radial and longitudinal systolic velocity gradients of the left ventricular free wall (LVFW), radial and longitudinal absolute values of peak systolic St of the LVFW, and longitudinal systolic right ventricular (RV) velocities (all P < .001 versus control) associated with longitudinal postsystolic contraction waves in 7/14 dogs. Early diastolic LVFW velocities also were decreased for longitudinal (P < .01) and radial (P < .05) motions. All radial LVFW, longitudinal basal LVFW, and RV systolic velocities were negatively correlated with heart rate (P < .01). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: LV contractility along both the short and long axes is impaired in dogs with spontaneous DCM, as is systolic RV and diastolic LVFW function. These myocardial alterations are associated with an inverse force-frequency relationship. Studies now are needed to determine the comparative sensitivity of TDI and St variables for the early detection of canine DCM.

Canine PCA is a histologically heterogeneous tumor, sometimes including inflammatory infiltrates. However, it is unknown whether COX-2 expression in canine PCA is related to the histologic type of tumor, to the presence of inflammation, or to both. Moreover, little is known about the mechanisms regulating COX-2 expression in neoplastic tissue. Hypothesis: COX-2 expression is related to the presence of inflammation in canine PCA and correlates with the degree of tumor differentiation. Methods: The expression of COX-2 was examined in 28 cases of canine PCA by immunohistochemistry. In addition, a neoplastic and a nonneoplastic canine prostatic cell line were used to investigate the effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-ot), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), epithelial growth factor (EGF), and specific signal transduction pathway inhibitors on COX-2 expression. Results: Twenty-four of the 28 prostate tumors showed COX-2 expression. The presence of inflammatory infiltrates in tumor tissue was associated with lower COX-2 expression scores. In vitro, TNF-a, IL-6, and EGF increased COX-2 expression in nonneoplastic cells but not in PCA cells, where baseline expression was high. COX-2 expression in PCA cells could be suppressed by means of specific phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K), protein kinase C (PKC), or inhibitor of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK/MAPK) inhibitors. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: COX-2 is expressed in canine PCA; however, expression is not related to the presence of inflammatory infiltrates. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that the cytokines TNF-a and IL-6 and their involved signaling pathways do not stimulate COX-2 expression in malignant canine prostate cells.

However, little information is available about its cardiac effects in dogs without systolic myocardial dysfunction. Hypothesis: Compared to benazepril (BNZ), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, PIMO may worsen valve regurgitation in early canine MVD. Animals: Twelve Beagles with asymptomatic MVD were randomized into 2 groups (n = 6) receiving BNZ or PIMO at dosages of 0.25 mg/kg PO q24h and q12h respectively, for 512 days. Methods: The study followed a blinded, randomized, prospective, and parallel group design. After day 512, the dogs were necropsied, and cardiac histopathology was performed in a blinded manner. Results: A significant treatment effect was observed as soon as day 15 with increased systolic function in the PIMO group by comparison to baseline value as assessed by fractional shortening (P < .0001) and tissue Doppler variables (P = .001). Concurrently, the maximum area and peak velocity of the regurgitant jet signal increased (P < .001), whereas these variables remained stable in the BNZ group. Histologic grades of mitral valve lesions were more severe in the PIMO group than in the BNZ group. Moreover, acute focal hemorrhages, endothelial papillary hyperplasia, and infiltration of chordae tendinae with glycosaminoglycans were observed in the mitral valves of dogs from the PIMO group but not in those of the BNZ group.

ACE inhibitors currently approved for use in veterinary medicine are benazepril, enalapril, imidapril and ramipril. They are all pro-drugs administered by oral route. A physiologically based model taking into account the saturable binding to ACE has been developed for pharmacokinetic analysis. The bioavailability of the active compounds from their respective pro-drug is low. The active metabolites are eliminated by renal, hepatorenal or biliary excretion, according to the drug. The elimination half-life of the free fraction of the active compounds is very short (ranging from approximately 10 min to 2 h). ACE inhibitors are generally well tolerated. Benazepril, enalapril, imidapril and ramipril are approved for dogs with chronic heart failure (CHF). The efficacy of ACE inhibitors has been convincingly demonstrated in dogs with CHF, especially in those with chronic valvular disease. In such clinical settings, ACE inhibitors improve hemodynamics and clinical signs, and increase survival time. In cats with cardiovascular disease, little information is available except for reports of some benefit in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in two non-controlled investigations. ACE inhibitors have also a mild to moderate hypotensive effect. There is also evidence to recommend ACE inhibitors in dogs and cats with chronic renal failure (CRF). They decrease the glomerular capillary pressure, have antiproteinuric effects, tend to delay the progression of CRF and to limit the extent of renal lesions. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; Cat; Dog; Heart failure; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacokinetics; Renal failure; Veterinary medicine"

Alterations in hemostatic pathways can be involved in the pathogenesis of CHF in dogs, and microthrombosis in the myocardium could contribute to increased mortality. Hypothesis: That plasma concentration or activity of hemostatic biomarkers is altered in dogs with CHF and that these factors predict mortality. Animals: Thirty-four dogs with CHF caused by either dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, n = 14) or degenerative valvular disease (CDVD, n = 20) compared with 23 healthy age-matched control dogs were included in this study. Dogs with CHF were recruited from 2 referral cardiology clinics, and control dogs were owned by friends or colleagues of the investigators. Methods: Clinical examination and echocardiography were performed in all dogs. Plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations, antithrombin and protein C activity, and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) were measured in all dogs. Results: Dogs with CHF had significantly higher fibrinogen (P = .04), D-dimer (P = .002), and TAT concentration (P < .0001), lower antithrombin (P < .0001) and protein C activity (P < .001) compared with control dogs. None of the hemostatic biomarkers were associated with risk of death. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: There is evidence of a procoagulant state in dogs with CHF. The lack of predictive value for survival might be due to the small number of dogs examined. Further studies are necessary to investigate the presence and importance of microthrombosis in dogs with CHF.

Limited information is available to assess the effect of blood pressure and the treatment of hypertension on survival. Hypothesis: That adequacy of blood pressure control is associated with the duration of survival in cats with systolic hypertension. Animals: One hundred and forty-one client-owned cats with systolic hypertension. Methods: Hypertensive cats were treated with amlodipine besylate and were followed until death or the study end point. Time-averaged systolic blood pressure (SBPOT) after implementation of antihypertensive medication and stabilization of systolic blood pressure (SBP) was calculated by using the equation (area under the curve/survival [days]). Cats were divided into quartiles based on their SBPOT, representing varying levels of blood pressure control (median [25th, 75th percentile]: Q1 = 137 [132, 141] mm Hg, Q2 = 148 [145, 151] mm Hg, Q3 = 157 [155, 158] mm Hg, Q4 = 170 [164, 175] mm Hg). Survival and clinical variables were compared between the quartiles. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to determine the association of age, renal function, proteinuria, SBPOT, and the presence of hyperthyroidism on survival. Urine protein to creatinine ratio (UP : C) was compared at diagnosis of hypertension and after initiating treatment. Results: Only UP : C and SBP at diagnosis differed significantly between SBPOT quartiles. Proteinuria was the only variable significantly related to survival in hypertensive cats. A significant decline in UP : C was found in cats treated with amlodipine besylate. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Proteinuria before and after treatment of hypertension is strongly associated with survival in cats with systolic hypertension. Treatment with amlodipine besylate can result in a significant reduction in UP: C. Copyright © 2007 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Amlodipine besylate; Proteinuria"

Students' quiz scores were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, using an outcome variable with the score for each item as numerator and maximum possible mark as denominator. Students' median quiz score was 49% of the maximum (range 23-80%). Students were more likely to gain a mark for items based on abnormal radiographs than for those based on normal radiographs (odds ratio 3.4, p<0.001). Skeletal radiographs were associated with lower scores (OR 0.75, p=0.03). The fewest marks were awarded for interpretation of a radiograph of a normal canine stifle and interpretation of a radiograph of a normal canine pelvis; these items were misinterpreted as abnormal by 86% and 80% of the students, respectively.

Relative adrenal insufficiency is generally associated with basal serum cortisol concentration within or above the reference range and a blunted cortisol response to adrenocorticotropic hormone administration. It is unknown whether relative adrenal insufficiency occurs in septic dogs. Hypothesis: That relative adrenal insufficiency occurs in septic dogs, and that relative adrenal insufficiency is associated with hypotension and mortality. Animals: Thirty-three septic dogs admitted to a small animal intensive care unit. Methods: Dogs were included in the study if they had a known or suspected infectious disease and had systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Dogs were excluded if they had disease or medication history expected to affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Serum cortisol and endogenous plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone concentrations were measured before, and serum cortisol concentration measured 1 hour after, intramuscular administration of 250 μg of cosyntropin/dog. The change in cortisol concentration (Δ-cortisol) before and after cosyntropin administration was determined in each dog. Results: Hypotension was associated with lower Δ-cortisol values (OR 1.3; CI 1.0-1.9; P = .029). Δ-Cortisol cutoff of 3.0 μg/dL was most accurate for predicting hypotension, survival to discharge, and 28-day survival. The rate of death in dogs with Δ-cortisol ≤3 μg/dL was 4.1 times that of dogs with Δ-cortisol >3 μg/dL (RR 4.1; CI 1.5-12.3; P = .01). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Δ-cortisol ≤3 μg/dL after adrenocorticotropic hormone administration is associated with systemic hypotension and decreased survival in septic dogs.

Hypotheses: Early diastolic mitral annular velocity is incrementally reduced from normal cats to MC cats with only an abnormal genotype to MC cats with abnormal genotype and hypertrophy. Animals: Group 1 consisted of 6 normal domestic shorthair cats, group 2 of 6 MC cats with abnormal genotype but no hypertrophy, and group 3 of 15 MC cats with hypertrophy and abnormal genotype. Methods: The genotype and echocardiographic phenotype of cats were determined, and the cats were divided into the 3 groups. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of the lateral mitral annulus from the left apical 4-chamber view was performed. Five nonconsecutive measurements of early diastolic mitral annular velocity (EM) or summated early and late diastolic velocity (EAsum) and heart rate were averaged. Results: There was an ordered reduction in Em-EAsum as group number increased (group 1, range 9.7-14.7 cm/s; group 2, range 7.5-13.2 cm/s; group 3, range 4.5-14.1 cm/s; P = .001). Using the lower prediction limit for normal Em-EAsum, the proportion of cats with normal Em-EAsum decreased as the group number increased (P = .001). However, Em-EAsum was reduced in only 3 of 6 cats in group 2. Conclusion: The incremental reduction of Em-EAsum as group severity increased indicates that diastolic dysfunction is an early abnormality that occurs before hypertrophy development. TDI measurement of Em or EAsum of the lateral mitral annulus is an insensitive screening test for identification of phenotypically normal, genotypically affected cats.

The survival time and prognostic factors predictive of survival in dogs with CTR remain unknown. Hypothesis: The prevalence and prognosis of CTR in dogs with MVD increases and decreases, respectively, with heart failure class. Animals: This study used 706 dogs with MVD. Methods: The diagnosis of CTR was based on a flail mitral leaflet with the tip pointing into the left atrium during systole, which was confirmed in several 2-dimension imaging planes using the left and right parasternal 4-chamber views. Results: CTR was diagnosed in 114 of the 706 dogs with MVD (16.1%) and most of these (106/114, 93%) had severe mitral valve regurgitation as assessed by color Doppler mode. CTR prevalence increased with International Small Animal Cardiac Health Council (ISACHC) clinical class (i.e., 1.9, 20.8, 35.5, and 69.6% for ISACHC classes la, Ib, II, and III, respectively [P < .05]). Long-term follow-up was available for 57 treated dogs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics) and 58% of these (33/57) survived >1 year after initial CTR diagnosis (median survival time, 425 days). Clinical class, the presence of ascites or acute dyspnea at the time of diagnosis, heart rate, plasma urea concentration, and left atrial size were predictors of survival. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: CTR is associated with a higher overall survival time than previously supposed. Its prognosis mostly depends on a combination of clinical and biochemical factors.

Data were obtained on horses with positive serological titres tested at the Coccidioidomycosis Serology Laboratory, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis from 1981 to 2004. Thirty-nine cases in which a diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis had been made were selected for inclusion. Six distinct categories were identified including abortion (n = 6), miliary/interstitial pneumonia (n = 6), pneumonia with thoracic effusion (pleural or pericardial) (n = 11), disseminated (n = 10), osteomyelitis (n = 3) and external abscessation (n = 3) both without pulmonary disease. Statistical differences in titre distribution were found between the abortion category and the pulmonary category (P = 0.003), the abortion category and pneumonia with thoracic effusion (P = 0.001), the abortion category and disseminated disease (P = 0.001), and the pulmonary form and pneumonia with effusion (P = 0.001). The other categories had overlapping titre results. Higher serological antibody titres seemed to be associated with a poorer prognosis for survival. Categories with the highest titres, disseminated (geometric mean titre = 104) and pneumonia with thoracic effusion (geometric mean titre = 226), were overwhelmingly fatal (19/21 known deaths) due to severe clinical disease. The categories with lower titres, abortion (geometric mean titre = 4), bone involvement only (geometric mean titre = 13) and cutaneous (geometric mean titre = 5), had a better survival rate (10/12 known survivors) and less severe clinical disease.

Hypothesis: Intestinal neoplasia of horses has characteristic clinicopathologic features. Animals: Thirty-four horses with intestinal neoplasia. Methods: Retrospective study. Results: Anamnesis, clinical signs, clinicopathologic and pathologic findings in 34 adult horses diagnosed histologically with intestinal neoplasia were reviewed. The horses ranged in age from 2 to 30 years (mean 16.6 years at presentation). The Arabian breed was most represented and there was no sex predisposition. The most common presenting complaints were weight loss, colic, anorexia, and fever. The most consistent clinical signs were poor body condition, tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, and diarrhea. Useful diagnostic tools included rectal examination, routine blood analyses, abdominocentesis, ultrasonographic examination, rectal biopsy, and exploratory laparotomy. Alimentary lymphoma was the most common intestinal neoplasia identified, followed by adenocarcinoma and smooth muscle tumors. The small intestine was the most common segment of intestine affected for all neoplasms. Intestinal neoplasia was diagnosed antemortem in 13 of 34 (38%) horses.

Hypothesis: In dogs with portosystemic shunting, low coagulation factor activity is responsible for coagulopathy, which can cause complications after surgery. Animals: Thirty-four dogs with CPS and 39 healthy dogs. Methods: In a prospective study, coagulation times, platelet count, and the activity of 8 coagulation factors were measured in dogs before and after surgical shunt attenuation and in 31 healthy dogs. The effect of abdominal surgery on hemostasis was determined at ovariectomy in 8 healthy dogs. Results: Dogs with CPS had lower platelet counts, lower activity of factors II, V, VII, and X, and increased factor VIII and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) compared to healthy dogs. After surgical attenuation, dogs with CPS had decreased platelet counts and activity of factors I, II, V, VII, IX, X, and XI and a prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Ovariectomy resulted in decreased activity of factors VII and X. Six weeks after surgery, portosystemic shunting persisted in 9 of 30 dogs, with no improvement of hemostatic values. CPS dogs without shunting had improved coagulation times and increased activity of factors II, V, VII, and X. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Dogs with CPS have lower activity of clotting factors compared to healthy dogs, resulting in a prolonged APTT. Surgical attenuation of the shunt results in increased abnormalities in coagulation times and factors immediately after surgery.

Survival of a confirmed case has not been reported previously. Hypothesis: Successful therapy of C piliforme infection in foals is possible. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to diagnose Tyzzer's disease antemortem or postmortem. Animals: Seven foals were included in the study. Methods: Retrospective study was made to evaluate the clinical and pathologic characteristics of foals with Tyzzer's disease. Medical records of the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at University of California Davis were reviewed. Foals <3 months old were included in the study if typical clinical signs were present and histologic examination identified multifocal coagulative necrosis and hepatitis with intracytoplasmic filamentous bacilli, consistent with C piliforme. A real-time TaqMan assay was developed to detect C piliforme gene sequences in liver tissue from affected foals. Results: Median survival time from onset of disease in nonsurviving foals was 30 hours (mean 34.5 ± 20.1; range, 16-62 hours). Common clinical findings included lethargy, recumbency, seizures, and fever. Laboratory findings included metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia and increased activity of hepatobiliary enzymes. Treatment consisted of IV fluids, antimicrobial and antiinflammatory drugs, and parenteral nutrition. One filly survived, whereas 6 died. Postmortem examination of the 6 foals that died disclosed hepatomegaly with multifocal necrosis. Liver tissue from 4 foals was positive for C piliforme gene sequences using PCR. Conclusions and clinical importance: Although the mortality rate of Tyzzer's disease is high, successful outcome is possible if intensive care is initiated promptly. PCR can be used for early and specific diagnosis. Copyright © 2006 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.","Clostridium piliforme infection; Horse; PCR; Sepsis"

Assessment of LVH-associated myocardial dysfunction could provide new insights in the understanding of the pathophysiology of these diseases. Hypothesis: Quantification of left-ventricular free-wall (LVFW) motion using tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) could permit differentiation of feline HCM from SHT-reiated LVH (LVH-SHT). Animals: A total of 108 cats of different breeds were enrolled in this study: 35 cats with HCM, 17 with concentric LVH and SHT, and 56 healthy cats as a control group. Methods: All cats were examined by conventional echocardiography and 2-dimensional color TDI. Results: Radial and longitudinal diastolic LVFW velocities were similarly altered in cats with HCM and LVH-SHT, compared to controls. Systolic velocities were also lower in the groups with hypertrophy than in the controls, for longitudinal but not radial motion. To determine whether these diastolic and systolic alterations could also be observed in cats without LVFW hypertrophy, we performed a subgroup analysis in cats with a normal M-mode examination, that is, with only a localized subaortic interventricular septum hypertrophy. A significant radial and longitudinal diastolic dysfunction was still observed in both the HCM and LVH-SHT groups compared to controls, and systolic dysfunction was detected in the longitudinal motion. Conclusions: LVFW motion is similarly altered in cats with HCM and LVH-SHT. This dysfunction occurs independently of the presence of myocardial hypertrophy, demonstrating that TDI is capable of detecting systolic and diastolic segmental functional changes in nonhypertrophied wall segments in cats with HCM and SHT.

Radiographic and computed tomographic (CT) findings in nasal disease have been reported, although involvement of other cranial structures has not been fully described to our knowledge. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that neoplastic or inflammatory obstruction of the auditory tube associated with sinonasal disease could result in CT evidence of effusive bulla disease in affected cats. Animals: 46 cats with sinonasal disease, 18 control cats. Methods: CT images acquired in cats with (n = 46) and without (n = 18) sinonasal disease were reviewed for evidence of concurrent bulla effusion. CT findings of soft tissue or fluid opacity within the tympanic bulla or thickening of the bone of the bullae were considered evidence of effusive bulla disease. Results: The prevalence of bulla effusion in cats with sinonasal disease was 28% (13/46) and was significantly higher than that observed in cats without sinonasal disease (1/18, P = .043). CT findings that were found in association with effusive bulla disease included imaging features of sinusitis and nasopharyngeal disease. The most common neoplasm associated with bulla effusion was nasopharyngeal lymphoma. Bulla effusion was not observed in any cat with nasal carcinoma. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Findings of this study suggest that auditory canal dysfunction may play a larger role in feline sinonasal disease than was previously recognized. The implications of these findings for management of cats with chronic inflammatory or neoplastic sinonasal disease require further investigation.

Hypothesis: Ramipril will reduce LV mass, improve diastolic function, and reduce myocardial fibrosis in cats with HCM without congestive heart failure (CHF). Animals: This prospective, blinded, placebo-controlled study included 26 Maine Coon and Maine Coon cross-bred cats with familial HCM but without CHF. Methods: Cats were matched for LV mass index (LVMI) and were randomized to receive ramipril (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo q24h for 1 year, with investigators blinded. Plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration, plasma aldosterone concentration, Doppler tissue imaging (DTI), and systolic blood pressure were measured at baseline and every 3 months for 1 year. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) was performed to quantify LV mass and myocardial fibrosis by delayed enhancement (DE) cMRI at baseline and 6 and 12 months. Plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was measured on 16 cats 1 hour after PO administration. Results: Plasma ACE activity was adequately suppressed (97%) in cats treated with ramipril. LV mass, LVMI, DTI, DE, blood pressure, plasma BNP, and plasma aldosterone were not different in cats treated with ramipril compared with placebo (P = .85, P = .94, P = .91, P = .89, P = .28, P = .18, and P = .25, respectively). Conclusion: Treatment of Maine Coon cats with HCM without CHF with ramipril did not change LV mass, improve diastolic function, alter DE, or alter plasma BNP or aldosterone concentrations in a relevant manner.

Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical signs, laboratory results, treatment methods, and outcome for rattlesnake envenomation in New World camelids. Animals: Medical records from 1988 to 2004 were searched for New World camelids presented for rattlesnake bite or clinical signs suspected to be related to recent envenomation. Twelve records were identified. Methods: From these records a retrospective study was performed. Results: Nine camelids presented for acute disease (2/9 arrived dead), whereas 3 presented for subacute onset of disease. Swelling of the lips, head and neck, tachypnea, dyspnea, tachycardia, and lethargy were the most common presenting signs. Snake bites were most commonly located to the muzzle (10/12). Common complete blood count (CBC) and serum biochemical abnormalities were neutrophilia, lymphopenia, increased muscle enzyme activity, hypoalbuminemia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Treatment included combinations of intravenous fluid therapy, antimicrobials, anti-inflammatory drugs, tetanus prophylaxis, tracheostomy, supplemental oxygen, antivenom, total parenteral nutrition, and nursing care. Five of the 10 animals with acute onset of clinical signs survived, and all animals with subacute presentation died. The mortality rate for New World camelids with severe local tissue reaction and systemic signs of envenomation was 58%. Clinical Importance: New World camelids that sustain rattlesnake envenomation and severe facial swelling precluding prehension and mastication have a guarded prognosis for survival. Aggressive treatment is recommended to optimize the chances of survival. Animals with less severe local tissue reaction and absence of systemic signs have a better prognosis.

However, modern echocardiographic and Doppler techniques currently offer a good view of the morphology of the interatrial septum, thus facilitating earlier detection of ASD in awake animals. In this context, we carried out a retrospective study of cases of recently diagnosed ASD in dogs and cats at the Cardiology Unit of Alfort (2001-2005) using echocardiography combined with colour Doppler mode. ASD was diagnosed in 156 animals and represented 37.7% of all canine and feline CHDs (n = 414). ASD was the most common CHD after mitral dysplasia in both species. Boxer and Domestic shorthair were the most common canine and feline breeds affected. Most defects (98.7%) were secundum-type ASD, without clinical signs in 73.7% of cases. The most common clinical signs included systolic murmur heard over the left heart base (20.2%), exercise intolerance (7.0%), syncope (5.3%), dyspnoea (2.6%) and cough (2.6%). Animals that presented a systolic heart murmur over the left base had a significantly larger ASD than others (P < 0.05). These data suggest that the incidence of ASD is higher than previously assumed. ASD should be suspected, for example, in instances of left basal systolic heart murmur, although its clinical and haemodynamic consequences are usually minor. © 2006 Blackwell Verlag.",

The diagnosis is commonly made by measuring plasma cortisol concentration before and after stimulation with ACTH, thereby ignoring aldosterone. In search of an alternative approach that would include assessment of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production, 2 pairs of endocrine variables were measured: (1) plasma concentration of cortisol and ACTH, and (2) plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity. In addition, the cortisol-to-ACTH ratio (CAR) and the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) were calculated. Reference intervals were established in a population of 60 healthy dogs. In these dogs, CAR ranged from 1.1 to 26.1 and ARR ranged from 0.1 to 1.5. The variables were compared with those of 22 dogs with spontaneous primary hypoadrenocorticism. Plasma concentration of cortisol and ACTH in both groups of dogs overlapped, whereas CAR did not. Similarly, plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity overlapped, whereas ARR did not. These observations indicate that measurement of these endogenous variables (in one blood sample) allows the specific diagnoses of primary hypocortisolism and primary hypoaldosteronism.

The accuracy of tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) for earlier detection of the disease has never been described. The objective of this sudy was to quantify left ventricular free wall (LVFW) velocities in cats with hypertrophic muscular dystrophy (HFMD) during preclinical cardiomyopathy using TDI. The study animals included 22 healthy controls and 7 cats belonging to a family of cats with HFMD (2 affected adult males, 2 heterozygous adult females, one 2.5-month-old affected male kitten, and 2 phenotypically normal female kittens from the same litter). All cats were examined via conventional echocardiography and 2-dimensional color TDI. No LVFW hypertrophy was detected in the 2 carriers or in the affected kitten when using conventional echocardiography and histologic examination, respectively. The LVFAV also was normal for 1 affected male and at the upper limit of normal for the 2nd male. Conversely, LVFW dysfunction was detected in all affected and carrier cats with HFMD when using TDI. TDI consistently detects LVFW dysfunction in cats with HFMD despite the absence of myocardial hypertrophy.

Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) echocardiography has emerged as a useful, noninvasive method for assessing diastolic function in cats. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) has been performed in cats and accurately quantifies left ventricular (LV) mass in normal cats. However, assessment of cardiac function in cats by cMRI has not been performed. Six normal Domestic Shorthair cats and 7 Maine Coon cats with moderate to severe HCM were sedated, and TDI of the lateral mitral annulus was performed. Peak early diastolic velocity (Em) was measured from 5 nonconsecutive beats. Cats were anesthetized with propofol and electrocardiogram-gated gradient echo cMRI was performed during apnea after hyperventilation. Short-axis images of the LV extending from the mitral annulus to the apex were obtained throughout the cardiac cycle. LV mass at end systole and LV volumes throughout the cardiac cycle were quantified according to Simpson's rule. To assess the possible influence of propofol on diastolic function, TDI was performed on the 7 cats with HCM while sedated and then while anesthetized with propofol. Em was significantly lower in cats with HCM than normal cats (6.7 ± 1.3 cm/s versus 11.6 ± 1.9 cm/s, P < .001, respectively). There was no difference in the cMRI indices of diastolic function in normal and HCM cats. Propofol did not reduce diastolic function (Em) in cats with HCM but mildly reduced systolic myocardial velocity (S) in Maine Coon cats with HCM that were anesthetized with propofol (P = .87 and P = .03, respectively).

Hypothesis: Proteinuria would be independently related to survival in cats with renal failure, with or without hypertension. Animals: The study included 136 client-owned cats; 28 apparently normal, 14 hypertensive but not azotemic, 66 azotemic but not hypertensive, and 28 both hypertensive and azotemic. Methods: Cox's proportional hazards model was used to determine the influence of initial plasma creatinine concentration, proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or albumin-to-creatinine ratio), age, and systemic hypertension on the risk of death or euthanasia during the follow-up period. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine the relation between severity of proteinuria and predictive variables, including age, plasma creatinine concentration, systolic blood pressure, sex, and urine specific gravity. Results: Plasma creatinine concentration and proteinuria were very highly related to survival. The hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) for death or euthanasia was 2.9 (1.4-6.3) and 4.0 (2.0-8.0) for urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 0.2-0.4 and >0.4, respectively, compared with the baseline group with a urine protein-to- creatinine ratio of <0.2 and were 2.4 (1.2-4.8) and 4.9 (2.3-10.2) for an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 30-82 mg/g and <82 mg/g, respectively, compared with a baseline group with albumin-to-creatinine ratio of <30 mg/g. Treated hypertensive cats did not have reduced survival, although systolic blood pressure, together with plasma creatinine concentration was positively related to the magnitude of proteinuria. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Despite the relatively low concentrations of proteinuria typical of chronic renal disease in cats, this measurement is of prognostic significance.

The LAL was easily and safely applied in all horses in less than five minutes and the procedure was well tolerated with minimal to no sedation. While 10 horses were able to stand in the LAL after being hoisted, 6 horses were unable to stand and were eventually euthanized due to the inability to regain weight bearing function. The LAL has shown to be a useful devise to evaluate the standing ability of recumbent horses and can be used alone or in combination with the Anderson Sling Support Devise to allow standing support of horses with a variety of debilitating problems. © 2006 by Verlag Hans Huber.","Horse; Large animal lift; Recumbency"

All 6 cats enrolled in the investigation were affected at the level of the distal aorta and had signs of the disease affecting both pelvic limbs. Cats were anesthetized and an arteriotomy was performed on 1 carotid artery to gain access to the arterial system. Selective arterial angiography was used to confirm the presence of thromboembolic disease. The thrombectomy system was advanced to the level of the thrombus using fluoroscopic guidance. Repeat angiography was used intermittently to assess progress of thromboembolus dissolution throughout the procedure. The use of the rheolytic thrombectomy system resulted in successful thrombus dissolution in 5 of 6 cats. Three of 6 cats survived to discharge. Both of these results compare favorably with conventional therapies used in the treatment of this disease. Feline distal aortic thromboembolism is a frustrating disease that warrants a guarded to poor prognosis. Rheolytic thrombectomy may provide veterinarians with an alternative therapy in the treatment of thromboembolic diseases, including feline distal aortic thromboembolism.

Animals - 72 dogs of small (6 Toy and 6 Miniature Poodles), medium (12 Beagles), and large breeds (12 Akitas and 36 Golden Retrievers). Procedure - Each dog's thyroid gland was examined ultrasonographically with a 10- to 5-MHz multifrequency linear-array transducer. Size, shape, echogenicity, and homogeneity of thyroid lobes were evaluated on longitudinal and transverse images. Thyroid lobe volume was estimated by use of the equation for an ellipsoid (π/6 [length × height × width]). Results - Thyroid lobes appeared fusiform or elliptical on longitudinal images and triangular or round to oval on transverse images. In most dogs, thyroid lobes were hyperechoic or isoechoic, compared with surrounding musculature, and had a homogeneous echogenic pattern. Mean length, width, height, and volume of thyroid lobes were significantly greater in Akitas and Golden Retrievers, compared with findings in Beagles or Poodles; mean length, width, and height were significantly greater in Beagles, compared with findings in Poodles. Total thyroid gland volume correlated with body weight (r = 0.73) and BSA (r = 0.74). Conclusions and clinical relevance - Among the dog breeds examined ultrasonographically, thyroid lobe size and volume were more variable than shape, echogenicity, and homogeneity. The correlation of thyroid gland volume with BSA suggests that size of the dog, rather than breed, should be considered, when assessing thyroid glands ultrasonographically.",

Equine practitioners must be able to interpret the use, limitations, and results of molecular diagnostic techniques, as they are increasingly integrated into routine microbiology laboratory protocols. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the best-known and most successfully implemented diagnostic molecular technology to date. It can detect slow-growing, difficult-to-cultivate, or uncultivatable microorganisms and can be used in situations in which clinical microbiology diagnostic procedures are inadequate, time-consuming, difficult, expensive, or hazardous to laboratory staff. Inherent technical limitations of PCR are present, but they are reduced in laboratories that use standardized protocols, conduct rigid validation protocols, and adhere to appropriate quality-control procedures. Improvements in PCR, especially probe-based real-time PCR, have broadened its diagnostic capabilities in clinical infectious diseases to complement and even surpass traditional methods in some situations. Furthermore, real-time PCR is capable of quantitation, allowing discrimination of clinically relevant infections characterized by pathogen replication and high pathogen loads from chronic latent infections. Automation of all components of PCR is now possible, which will decrease the risk of generating false-positive results due to contamination. The novel real-time PCR strategy and clinical applications in equine infectious diseases will be the subject of this review.

Coil implantation was achieved in 108 dogs (86%). Despite immediate complete ductal closure in only 34% of dogs, the procedure was hemodynamically successful as evidenced by a reduction in indexed left ventricular internal diameter in diastole (LVIDd; P < .0001), fractional shortening (P < .0001), and left atrial to aortic ratio (LA:Ao; P = .022) within 24 hours. Complete ductal closure was documented in 61% of dogs examined 12 to 63 months after coil occlusion. Long-standing residual ductal flow in the other 39% of dogs was not associated with increased indexed LVIDd or LA:Ao and was not hemodynamically relevant. Repeat intervention was deemed advisable in only 4 dogs with persistent (n = 1) or recurrent (n = 3) ductal flow. Complications included aberrant embolization (n = 27), death (n = 3), ductal reopening (n = 3), transient hemoglobinuria (n = 2), hemorrhage (n = 1), aberrant coil placement (n = 1), pulmonary hypertension (n = 1), and skin abscessation (n = 1). Serious infectious complications did not occur despite antibiotic administration to only 40% of these dogs. Transarterial coil occlusion was not possible in 14 dogs (11%) because of coil instability in the PDA and was associated with increased indexed minimum ductal diameter (P = .03), LVIDd (P = .0002), LVIDs (P = 0.001), and congestive left heart failure (P = .03) reflecting a relatively large shunt volume.

The objective of this study was to determine the variability of RVM velocities by tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) in healthy dogs (study 1), to analyze RVM motion in a large healthy canine population (study 2), and to compare the results with those obtained for the left ventricular free wall. Six healthy Beagle Dogs were monitored in study 1, and 64 healthy dogs of 14 different breeds were monitored in study 2. Velocities were recorded in 2 segments (basal and apical) of the right and left myocardial walls. In study 1, 36 TDI examinations were performed for 4 days, whereas a single TDI examination was performed on each dog in study 2. All velocity profiles included 1 positive systolic wave and 2 negative diastolic waves. The lowest intraday and interday coefficient of variation values of the right TDI variables were observed at the base (3.5-16.1%). The variability of the right apical velocities was much higher, with most coefficient of variation values > 15%. RVM velocities were higher in the basal than in the apical segments (P < .001) and were higher than the left velocities of the corresponding segment (P < .01). Body weight and breed had an effect on only a few right and left TDI variables. TDI provides a repeatable and reproducible method for evaluating basal RV function in the dog. These data also demonstrate the heterogeneity of the myocardial velocities between the left and the right ventricles and between the base and the apex.

An analysis of the database of the British Eventing register found that 33.7 per cent of horses registered for the first time in 1999 were not re-registered for eventing in subsequent years. By using multivariable logistic regression analysis, it was shown that horses that were kept at an event yard were more likely to be re-registered than those kept on other premises (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 3.2), and those that took part in showjumping while registered were also more likely to be re-registered (OR 1.5, 95 per cent CI 1.1 to 2.2).

Thirty-six healthy, 11 hypothyroid, and 35 euthyroid dogs with NTI were evaluated. Each thyroid lobe was examined ultrasonographically for size, shape, echogenicity, and homogeneity. Thyroid lobe volume was estimated by using the equation for an ellipsoid: π/6(length X height X width). No differences were found between healthy dogs and euthyroid dogs with NTI. In the majority of euthyroid dogs, the thyroid lobes were fusiform and triangular in shape in longitudinal and transverse planes, respectively. The thyroid capsule appeared smooth. The thyroid parenchyma had a homogeneous echogenic pattern and usually was hyperechoic or isoechoic compared with the surrounding musculature. Ultrasound findings in hypothyroid dogs were more variable, including a greater frequency of round to oval-shaped thyroid lobes in the transverse imaging plane (P < .05), hypoechogenicity of the thyroid parenchyma compared with surrounding musculature (P < .001), and a decrease in the size and volume of the thyroid lobes and total volume of the thyroid gland (P < .05) compared with euthyroid dogs. Other findings in hypothyroid dogs included an irregular surface to the thyroid capsule, a heterogeneous pattern to the thyroid parenchyma, and differences in the echogenic pattern between the left and right thyroid lobes.

No significant difference in platelet activation markers was found among groups. The data suggest that a form of platelet dysfunction detected at high shear rates was present in dogs with MR and SAS, possibly associated with a qualitative vWf defect. Aggregation results suggest increased platelet reactivity in Cavaliers, but the platelets did not appear to circulate in a preactivated state in either disease.

The purposes of this consensus statement are to describe an appropriate approach for accomplishing these tasks and to provide specific recommendations for assessing and managing dogs and cats with proteinuria based on data that are currently available. Because proteinuria and albuminuria have numerous possible causes, they must be assessed appropriately to determine their implications for the patient. This assessment involves localization of the origin of the proteinuria as well as determination of its persistence and magnitude. Because persistent renal proteinuria usually indicates presence of chronic kidney disease, which sometimes is a progressive disorder, its detection identifies dogs and cats that have increased risk for adverse health outcomes. Thus, urine testing that will detect proteinuria should be a component of the clinical evaluations of dogs and cats under all circumstances that prompt their veterinarians to also perform comprehensive hematologic and serum biochemical evaluations. At a minimum, this testing should consist of a complete urinalysis that includes a satisfactorily accurate semiquantitative test for protein, and positive reactions should be properly followed with further testing. The appropriate response to persistent renal proteinuria depends on the magnitude of proteinuria and the status of the patient. The recommended response generally involves continued monitoring, further investigation, and therapeutic intervention, which should be implemented as an escalating series of inclusive, stepwise responses.

The objective of this study was to use the ultrasonographic contrast agent SonoVue™ to evaluate various transit time indices in the normal canine liver, to examine the effect of anesthesia on these parameters, and to evaluate the safety of this agent in dogs. The liver of 11 healthy dogs was studied by ultrasound during an intravenous bolus injection of SonoVue™. Each dog underwent the examination twice, first with and later without the use of anesthesia. A time-intensity curve was generated from a selected region of interest within the liver from each scanning session. Ratios derived from peak enhancement, time to peak enhancement, up-slope and full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the curve were calculated from the time-intensity curves, and are reported. There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) in peak enhancement, up-slope and FWHM between dogs that were anesthetized and dogs that were not. Time to peak enhancement, however, was significantly shorter when the dogs were anesthetized than when they were nonanesthetized (P < 0.05). There were no biologically significant changes in clinical laboratory findings. This study indicates that contrast-enhanced ultrasound using SonoVue™ gives reproducible liver perfusion data, and appears to be a safe and well-tolerated agent for use in dogs. When considering normal values, the use of anesthetic drugs has to be considered.","Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography; Critical difference; Dogs; Liver; Perfusion; Safety; SonoVue™; Time-intensity curves"

The causes for the hemoperitoneum were idiopathic (8 horses), splenic hematoma with capsular tear (7), bleeding from the reproductive tract (3), multicentric hemangiosarcoma (1), and systemic amyloidosis (1). The affected horses were between 4 and 32 years of age (median 11.5 years). The most consistent findings on initial examination were depression, tachycardia, tachypnea, pale mucous membranes, prolonged capillary refill time, colic, and abdominal discomfort. Less common clinical signs included abdominal distention, profuse sweating, ataxia, and broad ligament mass palpated on rectal examination. Clinicopathologic abnormalities commonly detected were anemia, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypoproteinemia, hypocalcemia, azotemia, increased creatinine kinase, and sorbitol dehydrogenase activity. Hemoperitoneum was diagnosed on the basis of abdominocentesis, transabdominal ultrasonography, and postmortem examination. Sixteen horses were treated, and 3 horses were euthanized at owners' request because of severe clinical signs. The treatment consisted of the administration of intravenous fluids, plasma or blood transfusion, nonsteroidal drugs, antimicrobial drugs, and antifibrinolytic and procoagulant agents. Rapid clinical deterioration was observed in 2 horses, necessitating euthanasia. The remaining 14 horses survived the abdominal bleeding (survival rate 74%) and were discharged 3-15 days (median 7.0 days) after presentation. Postmortem examination of the 6 nonsurvivors showed massive abdominal hemorrhage from splenic hematoma with capsular tear (2 horses), multicentric hemangiosarcoma with liver rupture (1), systemic amyloidosis with splenic hematoma and capsular tear (1), and bilateral ruptured ovarian hematomas (1). In one horse, no origin of the bleeding could be determined during postmortem examination.

This review introduces the concept of PK/PD modelling, an approach in which PK and PD data are generated in the same study, and used to derive numerical values for PD parameters based on drug plasma concentrations. The PD parameters define the efficacy, potency and slope (sensitivity) of the concentration-effect relationship. It is proposed that the parameters derived from PK/PD modelling may be used as an alternative and preferred approach to dose titration studies for selecting rational dosage regimens (both dose and dosing interval) for further evaluation in clinical trials. In PK/PD modelling, the explicative variable for effect is the plasma concentration profile. The PK/PD approach provides several advantages over dose-titration studies, including determination of a projected dosage regimen by investigation of a single dose. in contrast to dose-ranging studies which by definition require testing of multiple dosage. Implementation of PK/PD modelling in the veterinary drug development process is currently constrained by the limited number of veterinary studies performed to date, and the consequently limited understanding of PK/PD concepts and their absence from regulatory authority guidelines. Nevertheless, PK/PD modelling has major potential for rational dosage regimen determination, as it considers and quantifies the two main sources of interspecies variability (PK and PD). It is therefore applicable to interspecies extrapolation and to multiple species drug development. As well as the currently limited appreciation of PK/PD principles in the veterinary scientific community, a further constraint in implementing PK/PD modelling is the need to validate PK/PD approaches and thereby gain confidence in its value by pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities.",

Integrating PK and PD data can also provide a basis for selecting clinically relevant dosing schedules for subsequent evaluation in disease models and clinical trials. The principles underlying and uses of PK-PD integration are illustrated in this review for phenylbutazone in the horse and cow, carprofen and meloxicam in the horse, carprofen and meloxicam in the cat and nimesulide in the dog. In the PK-PD modelling approach for NSAIDs, the PK and PD data are generated (usually though not necessarily) in vivo in the same investigation and then modelled in silico, usually using the integrated effect compartment or indirect response models. Drug effect is classically modelled with the sigmoidal Emax (Hill) equation to derive PD parameters which define efficacy, potency and sensitivity. The PK-PD modelling approach for NSAIDs can be undertaken at the molecular level using surrogates of inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms (or indeed other enzymes e.g. 5-lipoxygenase). Examples are provided of the generation of PD parameters for several NSAIDs (carprofen, ketoprofen, vedaprofen, flunixin and tolfenamic acid) in species of veterinary interest (horse, calf, sheep and goat), which indicate that all drugs investigated except vedaprofen were non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 in the four species investigated under the experimental conditions used, vedaprofen being a COX-1 selective NSAID. In these studies, plasma concentration was linked to COX inhibitory action in the biophase using an effect compartment model. Data for S-(+)-ketoprofen have been additionally subjected to inter-species modelling and allometric scaling of both PK and PD parameters. For several species values of four PK parameters were highly correlated with body weight, whilst values for PD parameters based on COX inhibition lacked allometric relationship with body weight. PK-PD modelling of NSAIDs has also been undertaken using clinical end-points and surrogates for clinical end-points in disease models. By measurement of clinically relevant indices in clinically relevant models, data generated for PD parameters have been used to set dosages and dose intervals for evaluation and confirmation in clinical trials. PK-PD modelling of NSAIDs is likely to prove superior to conventional dose titration studies for dosage schedule determination, as it sweeps the whole of the concentration-effect relationship for all animals and therefore permits determination of genuine PD parameters. It also introduces time as a second independent variable thus allowing prediction of dosage interval. Using indirect response models and clinically relevant indices, PD data have been determined for flunixin, phenylbutazone and meloxicam in the horse, nimesulide in the dog and meloxicam in the cat.",

It may be studied at many organizational levels - sub-molecular, molecular, cellular, tissue/organ and whole body - using in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro methods and utilizing a wide range of techniques. A few drugs owe their PD properties to some physicochemical property or action and, in such cases, detailed molecular drug structure plays little or no role in the response elicited. For the great majority of drugs, however, action on the body is crucially dependent on chemical structure, so that a very small change, e.g. substitution of a proton by a methyl group, can markedly alter the potency of the drug, even to the point of loss of activity. In the late 19th century and first half of the 20th century recognition of these facts by Langley, Ehrlich, Dale, Clarke and others provided the foundation for the receptor site hypothesis of drug action. According to these early ideas the drug, in order to elicit its effect, had to first combine with a specific 'target molecule' on either the cell surface or an intracellular organelle. It was soon realized that the 'right' chemical structure was required for drug-target site interaction (and the subsequent pharmacological response). In addition, from this requirement, for specificity of chemical structure requirement, developed not only the modern science of pharmacology but also that of toxicology. In relation to drug actions on microbes and parasites, for example, the early work of Ehrlich led to the introduction of molecules selectively toxic for them and relatively safe for the animal host. In the whole animal drugs may act on many target molecules in many tissues. These actions may lead to primary responses which, in turn, may induce secondary responses, that may either enhance or diminish the primary response. Therefore, it is common to investigate drug pharmacodynamics (PDs) in the first instance at molecular, cellular and tissue levels in vitro, so that the primary effects can be better understood without interference from the complexities involved in whole animal studies. When a drug, hormone or neurotransmitter combines with a target molecule, it is described as a ligand. Ligands are classified into two groups, agonists (which initiate a chain of reactions leading, usually via the release or formation of secondary messengers, to the response) and antagonists (which fail to initiate the transduction pathways but nevertheless compete with agonists for occupancy of receptor sites and thereby inhibit their actions). The parameters which characterize drug receptor interaction are affinity, efficacy, potency and sensitivity, each of which can be elucidated quantitatively for a particular drug acting on a particular receptor in a particular tissue. The most fundamental objective of PDs is to use the derived numerical values for these parameters to classify and sub-classify receptors and to compare and classify drugs on the basis of their affinity, efficacy, potency and sensitivity. This review introduces and summarizes the principles of PDs and illustrates them with examples drawn from both basic and veterinary pharmacology. Drugs acting on adrenoceptors and cardiovascular, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial drugs are considered briefly to provide a foundation for subsequent reviews in this issue which deal with pharmacokinetic (PK)-PD modelling and integration of these drug classes. Drug action on receptors has many features in common with enzyme kinetics and gas adsorption onto surfaces, as defined by Michaelis-Menten and Langmuir absorption equations, respectively. These and other derived equations are outlined in this review. There is, however, no single theory which adequately explains all aspects of drug-receptor interaction. The early 'occupation' and 'rate' theories each explain some, but not all, experimental observations. From these basic theories the operational model and the two-state theory have been developed. For a discussion of more advanced theories see Kenakin (1997).",

It is not intended to be comprehensive, in that it covers neither minor species nor several important aspects of NSAID PD. The limited objective of the review is to summarise those aspects of NSAID PK and PD, which are important to an understanding of PK-PD integration and PK-PD modelling (the subject of the next review in this issue). The general features of NSAID PK are: usually good bioavailability from oral, intramuscular and subcutaneous administration routes (but with delayed absorption in horses and ruminants after oral dosing), a high degree of binding to plasma protein, low volumes of distribution, limited excretion of administered dose as parent drug in urine, marked inter-species differences in clearance and elimination half-life and ready penetration into and slow clearance from acute inflammatory exudate. The therapeutic effects of NSAIDs are exerted both locally (at peripheral inflammatory sites) and centrally. There is widespread acceptance that the principal mechanism of action (both PD and toxicodynamics) of NSAIDs at the molecular level comprises inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme in the arachidonic acid cascade, which generates inflammatory mediators of the prostaglandin group. However, NSAIDs possess also many other actions at the molecular level. Two isoforms of COX have been identified. Inhibition of COX-1 is likely to account for most of the side-effects of NSAIDs (gastrointestinal irritation, renotoxicity and inhibition of blood clotting) but a minor contribution also to some of the therapeutic effects (analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions) cannot be excluded. Inhibition of COX-2 accounts for most and possibly all of the therapeutic effects of NSAIDs. Consequently, there has been an intensive search to identify and develop drugs with selectivity for inhibition of COX-2. Whole blood in vitro assays are used to investigate quantitatively the three key PD parameters (efficacy, potency and sensitivity) for NSAID inhibition of COX isoforms, providing data on COX-1:COX-2 inhibition ratios. Limited published data point to species differences in NSAID-induced COX inhibition, for both potency and potency ratios. Members of the 2-arylpropionate sub-groups of NSAIDs exist in two enantiomeric forms [R-(-) and S-(+)] and are licensed as racemic mixtures. For these drugs there are marked enantiomeric differences in PK and PD properties of individual drugs in a given species, as well as important species differences in both PK and PD properties.",

The majority of the dogs had visited an endemic area (most often the Mediterranean area or the Dutch Antilles), but two dogs became infected with Babesia in the Netherlands. Babesia infections were associated with a stay in an endemic area and an incubation period that are both significantly shorter (less than 3 months) than those for Ehrlichia and co-infections (more than 3 months). Reasons for the owner to seek veterinary attention (lethargy, anorexia, fever), findings from the physical examination (pale mucous membranes, hepato-/splenomegaly) and laboratory results (anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypo-albuminemia) were highly aspecific, making serology or PCR mandatory for diagnosing infections.

Nineteen randomly chosen healthy foals were imprint trained at birth and 24 h later (Group A). Twenty-one similar foals that were not imprint-trained served as age-matched controls (Group B). Training began within 10 min of birth and consisted of touch desensitization by gentle rubbing. Each tactile stimulus was repeated 30-50 times over 45-60 min, until the foal no longer resisted the procedure and appeared relaxed. The procedure was then repeated at 24 h of age. At that time a physical examination and blood analysis were performed to assess the foals' health status. Group B animals were not handled except for a brief physical examination and blood analysis at 24 h of age. Thereafter all foals were kept on pastures with their dams with no further handling until they were three months of age. Any foals handled for other reasons before that time were excluded from the study. At three months, each of the 28 foals that completed the study experienced the following handling procedures: acceptance of restraint, haltering, complete physical examination, acceptance of a plastic rebreathing bag, touching the whole body, intramuscular vaccination in the neck, intranasal vaccination, and deworming with oral paste. Response to each procedure was scored (1=not resistant, 2=low resistance, 3=strong resistance, 4=not possible without major physical restraint). Conditioned foals (Group A) were significantly less resistant to touching the front and hind legs and picking up the hind feet (P<0.05). The administration of vaccines and paste dewormer and the collection of blood were tolerated by the majority of the foals of both groups with no or low resistance. It appeared that neonatal imprint training resulted in a learned behaviour that resulted in decreased self-defence responses towards handling the limbs at three months of age. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Veterinary medical schools can play a positive role in increasing pet adoption and combating overpopulation by providing free neutering for shelter animals. This retrospective cohort study illustrated that the cooperative efforts of a veterinary medicine surgical teaching program and local animal shelters decreases euthanasia of adoptable pets. At the University of California, Davis (UCD), shelter dogs are neutered by veterinary students and then returned to the shelter for adoption. The rates of adoption and euthanasia of the dogs neutered at UCD were contrasted with a comparison shelter group to determine the effect of pre-adoption neutering. The UCD-neutered dogs had a lower rate of euthanasia than the comparison shelter group at the shelters investigated. At Sacramento County Animal Care and Regulation, 73% of the UCD group but only 36% of the comparison group were adopted. At Yolo County Animal Services, 71% of the UCD group and 45% of the comparison group were adopted. The sex of an animal did not significantly affect the rate of euthanasia. Dogs that were predominantly pit bull, rottweiler, or chow chow breeds had higher rates of euthanasia than other breeds, independent of neuter status. Also, juveniles (less than one year old) had lower rates of euthanasia than adults, independent of neuter status. UCD adult dogs had lower rates of euthanasia than comparison adults. Post-surgical UCD dogs spent a longer average time in the shelter before adoption (15 days at Sacramento; 16 days at Yolo) than the comparison dogs (11 and 12 days, respectively). UCD dogs also spent a longer average time in the shelter before euthanasia (18 and 25 days, respectively) than the comparison dogs (13 days at both shelters). Lower probabilities of euthanasia for behavioral or medical reasons were found for UCD dogs than for the comparison dogs. The probability of euthanasia for reasons of space limitations increased with time in shelter for both groups. In this study, pre-adoption neutering increased adoptions without increasing the probability of medical or behavioral euthanasia.",

Joint diseases are common in companion animal medicine (horse, dog, cat) and at least 80% of cases are classified as osteoarthritis (OA). Several drug classes are available for OA therapy, including corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), agents with potential disease modifying properties and nutraceuticals. For long-term maintenance OA treatment, particularly in the horse and dog, NSAIDs are routinely and extensively used. This review outlines the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of NSAIDs in companion and farm animal species. NSAID PK and PD have been studied in models of acute inflammation, which enable use of PK-PD modeling to facilitate (a) studies of mechanism of action at the molecular level and (b) prediction of dosages for clinical use. The PK-PD approach is a powerful but underutilized tool which also facilitates inter-species comparisons.","Dog; Horse; NSAIDs; Osteoarthritis; Pain; PK-PD modeling; Ruminants"

Patients with hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, and thrombocytopathy have been effectively and safely treated as well as patients with severe trauma or surgery resulting in profuse bleeding and patients with impaired liver function. Given these successes, the possibility of using rFVIIa in veterinary medicine is appealing. The clinical indications and uses in veterinary medicine would be similar, but there are currently two major obstacles: immunogenicity and cost. If these problems can be addressed, rFVIIa may become a valuable and indispensable therapy, especially in the emergency and critical care settings. The use of rFVIIa could allow for successful treatment of otherwise intractable bleeding as well as decrease the number of blood transfusions needed.",

Study Design - Histologic assessment of wound repair after ventriculotomy. Animal Population - Eighteen adult Japanese quail. Methods - All quail had a ventriculotomy through the caudoventral thin muscle. The quail were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: group I (n = 9) had routine closure and group II (n = 9) had routine closure and the application of a porcine submucosal collagen patch over the serosal surface of the ventricular suture line. Three quail from each group underwent necropsy at 7, 14, and 21 days after surgery and healing of the ventriculotomy site was evaluated by microscopy. Results - Ventricular mucosal epithelium was completely healed at 21 days postoperatively. Time to restoration of the ventricular submucosal integrity was variable in both groups. There was evidence of a gross or microscopic perforation in 4 quail in group II, which was statistically significant (P = .041). Quail with perforations had significantly elevated numbers of ventricular serosal lymphoid aggregates compared with those without perforations (P = .029). There were no other significant temporal differences between group I and group II for mortality or histopathologic grading of wound healing. Conclusions - A porcine collagen patch did not enhance ventriculotomy wound healing. Subjectively, the collagen patch might have contributed to perforation by the generation of a lymphocytic xenograft rejection response. Clinical Relevance - Ventriculotomy can be safely performed using routine closure methods in healthy birds. © Copyright 2003 by The American College of Veterinary Surgeons.",

The methods convert all desfuroyl -ceftiofur-related residues containing the intact β-lactam ring to desfuroylceftiofur acetamide to establish ceftiofur residues in tissues. Four laboratories analyzed 5 sets of samples for each tissue. Each sample set consisted of a control/blank sample and 3 control samples fortified with ceftiofur at 0.5 Rm, Rm, and 2 Rm, respectively, where Rm is the U.S. tolerance assigned for ceftiofur residue in each tissue/matrix: 0.100 μg/mL for milk, 8.0 μg/g for kidney (both species), 1.0 μg/g for bovine muscle, and 2.0 μg/g for swine muscle. Each sample set also contained 2 samples of incurred-residue tissues (one &gt; Rm and one &lt; Rm) from animals treated with ceftiofur hydrochloride. All laboratories completed the method trial after a familiarization phase and test of system suitability in which they demonstrated &gt;80% recovery in pretrial fortified test samples. Results showed that the methods met all acceptable performance criteria for recovery, accuracy, and precision. Although sample preparation was easy, solid-phase extraction cartridge performance must be carefully evaluated before samples are processed. The liquid chromatography detection system was easily set up; however, the elution profile may require slight modifications. The procedures could clearly differentiate between violative (&gt;Rm) and nonviolative (&lt;Rm) ceftiofur residues. Participating laboratories found the procedures suitable for ceftiofur residue determination.",

Sample Population - 157 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded MCTs from dogs in the pathology database of the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California, Davis. Procedure - Genomic DNA was isolated from tumor specimens and a polymerase chain reaction procedure was performed to determine whether there were ITDs in exons 11 and 12. Results - We identified ITDs in 1 of 12 (8%) grade-I, 42 of 119 (35%) grade-II, and 9 of 26 (35%) grade-III tumors (overall prevalence, 52 of 157 [33%]). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds of grade-II and -III tumors possessing an ITD were approximately 5 times greater than that for graded tumors, although these odds did not differ significantly. Although MCTs possessing an ITD were twice as likely to recur after excision and twice as likely to result in metastasis as those without an ITD, these values also did not differ significantly. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - These results provide evidence that ITDs in c-kit occur frequently in MCTs of dogs. The high prevalence of c-kit activating mutations in MCTs of dogs combined with the relative abundance of mast cell disease in dogs provide an ideal naturally developing tumor in which to test the safety and efficacy of novel small-molecule kinase inhibitors such as imatinib mesylate.",

During the years 1993-1998, 15363 male dogs were admitted to the Utrecht University Clinic of Companion Animals, and of these dogs 225 were diagnosed with prostatic disease. In addition, another 206 male dogs were diagnosed as having prostatic disease based on cytologic examination of aspiration biopsies submitted by referring veterinarians. Benign prostatic hyperplasia was diagnosed in 246 dogs (57.1%), prostatitis in 83 dogs (19.3%), and PCA in 56 dogs (13%). Dogs with PCA were significantly older (mean age=9.9 years) than dogs with other prostatic diseases (mean age=8.4 years). The Bouvier des Flandres breed had an increased risk (odds ratio (OR)=8.44; 95% CI 4.38-16.1) of having PCA. Castration (26/56) increased the risk (OR=4.34; 95% CI 2.48-7.62) of PCA. The mean age at diagnosis of PCA in castrated dogs and in intact male dogs was not significantly different. The interval between castration and onset of prostatic problems was highly variable, suggesting that castration does not initiate the development of PCA in the dog, but it does favour tumor progression. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

The information contained in the atlas is currently managed and presented using the Key Indicators Mapping System (KIMS), and will also be integrated using the Key Indicators Database System (KIDS). Both systems were developed by the World Agricultural Information Centre of the FAO (FAO-WAICENT), the former as a stand-alone application and the latter for access via the Internet. Components of the atlas include vector maps, livestock disease and production databases, rules for country-level disease risk classification and 'disease cards' containing basic background information on diseases included in the atlas. The disease data is currently based primarily on Office International des Epizooties (OIE) disease reports, and the livestock production data on the FAO-WAICENT database. The atlas is highly interactive and allows visual presentation of information using maps, tables and charts. It also contains links to relevant resource information on the Internet. Diseases covered in the animal health layer include most OIE List A diseases and a subset of OIE List B diseases. Extensive analyses have been conducted to develop a set of qualitative and semi-quantitative criteria that allow improved disease status classifications based on 5-years cumulative OIE disease reports, and official disease control declarations. Classification rules were determined depending on the epidemiological features of each disease and considering spatial heterogeneity of disease presence in local regions. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

These differences lead to species variation in drug pharmacokinetics, which can be profound. This review highlights selected aspects of species differences in pharmacokinetics and considers underlying mechanisms by reference to ruminant and non-ruminant mammals, birds, fish and bees. For all species it is desirable and should be possible to design dosage schedules based on knowledge of drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. There have been many attempts to integrate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data to provide dosage schedules which optimize efficacy and minimize opportunities for the development of antimicrobial resistance in both laboratory animal studies and human clinical trials. However, there have been relatively few studies in animal species of major veterinary interest. This review summarizes recent studies in four ruminant species (calf, sheep, goat and camel) which have used PK-PD integration to determine for the fluoroquinolone, danofloxacin, AUC/MIC ratios producing (a) bacteriostasis (b) bactericidal activity and (c) elimination of bacteria. Future possible developments in dosage schedule design are considered. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.","Animals; Dosing; Humans; Resistance"

Sample Population - Normal teeth from 22 cadaver cats and ORL-affected teeth from 21 cats admitted to the veterinary hospital for dental treatment. Procedure - An electron microprobe was used to analyze weight percentages of calcium, phosphorus, fluorine, sodium, magnesium, sulfur, potassium, and iron in enamel, dentin, and cementum. Results - Calcium and phosphorus were the most abundant elements. Fluorine, sodium, and magnesium combined were < 5% and sulfur, potassium, and iron combined were < 0.1% of total elemental composition. In enamel of normal teeth, a significant sex-by-jaw location interaction was seen in mean (± SD) phosphorus content, which was higher in mandibular teeth of females (17.64 ± 0.41%) but lower in mandibular teeth of males (16.71 ± 0.83%). Mean iron content in dentin of normal teeth was significantly lower in mandibular teeth than maxillary teeth (0.014 ± 0.005% vs 0.023 ± 0.019%). Mean enamel sodium content was significantly higher (0.77 ± 0.046% vs 0.74 ± 0.025) and mean enamel iron content was significantly lower (0.017 ± 0.008% vs 0.021 ± 0.005%) in ORL-affected teeth, compared with normal teeth.

In humans, primary MVP is associated with increased platelet reactivity. In Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS), a breed predisposed to myxomatous mitral valve disease, there is a high prevalence of hypomagnesemia and platelet anomalies, such as thrombocytopenia and macrothrombocytosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate platelet aggregation responses in CKCS and to determine the relationship between the platelet aggregation response and serum magnesium concentration, MVP, mitral regurgitation (MR), and platelet count. In 19 CKCS with MVP and 7 control dogs (not CKCS), the platelet aggregation response to 3 different agonists was compared. The CKCS with > 100,000 platelets/μL (n = 10) had a significantly higher maximum aggregation response with regard to all tested agonists than the CKCS with < 100,000 platelets/μL (n = 9) and control dogs (n = 7). The CKCS with < 100,000 platelets/μ.L had a platelet aggregation response similar to the control dogs. There was no correlation between degree of MVP and platelet aggregation response. Platelet diameter increased (P = .006) and serum magnesium concentration decreased (P = .04) with lower platelet concentration. In conclusion, CKCS with MVP appeared to separate into 2 groups-1 group with < 100,000 platelets/μL, normal platelet aggregation, low serum magnesium concentration, and enlarged platelets, and another group with > 100,000 platelets/μL, increased platelet aggregation, and normal serum magnesium concentration and platelet size.

Six dogs with CHF were administered placebo or 4 mg/kg 5-ISMN on separate days with a 1-week washout period between randomized dosings. Data were collected at baseline and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 minutes after dosing. Measured variables included indirect arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), packed cell volume (PCV), scintigraphic count rates for normal dogs, and scintigraphic count rates for CHF dogs. Blood for plasma 5-ISMN concentration determination was collected at 60 minutes. Scintigraphic counts were corrected for decay and expressed as a percentage of the whole. No differences were detected in BP, HR, PCV, thoracic blood volume percentage (TBVP), or abdominal blood volume percentage (ABVP) between placebo and 5-ISMN in normal dogs at any dose. No differences were detected in TBVP or ABVP between placebo and 5-ISMN in dogs with CHF. Plasma 5-ISMN concentration exceeded the minimum therapeutic concentration in all dogs and at all doses 60 minutes after drug administration. Equilibrium blood pool imaging failed to detect a shift in blood volume with oral 5-ISMN administration at any dose tested in normal dogs and dogs with CHF, despite adequate drug absorption. On the basis of the results of this study, 5-ISMN may not be beneficial in the treatment of dogs with CHF.

All 288 farms were visited between July and October 1997. Data analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate techniques. The results showed that, on average, BAHS users had larger cattle herds (16.3) than part-users (14.7) or non-users (12.4). Similarly, the annual yields of crops were higher for users compared to either of the other groups. Users occupied better houses and owned a larger number of farm and household items than did part-users or non-users. A third of all farmers were engaged in additional income generation to lessen the risk of poverty. However, analysis of the livestock management and the educational background of the farmers suggested that usage of the BAHS programme was not only determined by already existing 'wealth'. Improved livestock husbandry and management measures, which do not require capital investment, were more frequently applied by users compared to either of the other groups. Non-users and part-users had attained a lower level of education, were less open towards improved farming methods and felt less knowledgeable than BAHS users. The average straight-line distances from farms using BAHS to their respective village animal health worker (2.2 km) or veterinary assistant (2.9 km) were similar but varied according to ecological zone. Intensified extension and awareness meetings in villages will be required to get more non-users involved in BAHS.","Cattle; Education; Extension; Farmers; Livestock; Sociology; Veterinary services; Wealth"

This study was designed to compare the bioequivalence of the sodium salt in cattle after a single intramuscular (i.m.) or subcutaneous dose (s.c.) of 2.2 mg ceftiofur equivalents/kg body weight. The criteria used to evaluate bioequivalence were (1) the area under the curve from time of injection to the limit of quantitation (LOQ) of the assay (AUC(O-LOQ)), and (2) time concentrations remained above 0.2 μg/mL (t(>0.2)). Twelve crossbred beef cattle were enrolled in a three-period, two-treatment crossover trial, with a minimum 2-week washout period between doses of 2.2 mg ceftiofur equivalents/kg. Blood samples were collected serially for up to 72 h post-injection. Plasma samples were then analyzed using a validated assay that measures ceftiofur, and all desfuroylceftiofur-related metabolites, by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as the stable derivative, desfuroylceftiofur acetamide. A maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of 13.9 ± 3.55 μg/mL was observed from 0.67 - 2.0 h after i.m. administration, whereas a C(max) of 13.6 ± 3.85 μg/mL was observed from 0.67 - 3.0 h after s.c. administration. The AUC(O-LOQ) was 108 ± 35.0 μg · h/mL after i.m. dosing, compared with 105 ± 29.8 μg · h/mL after s.c. dosing. The pre-established criterion for equivalence of the AUC(O-LOQ) for the i.m. and s.c. routes of administration was satisfied. The t(>0.2) was 49.2 ± 8.55 h after i.m. administration, compared with 47.0 ± 9.40 h after s.c. administration. The pre-established criterion for equivalence of the t(>0.2) for i.m. and s.c. administration was satisfied. The equivalence of AUC(O-LOQ) and t(>0.2) for i.m. and s.c. administration of 2.2 mg ceftiofur equivalents (CE)/kg doses of ceftiofur sodium suggest similar therapeutic efficacy and systemic safety for the two routes of administration.",

Design - Database analysis. Sample Population - Human and animal populations, including populations of veterinarians, throughout the United States. Procedures - Data on animal and human populations were compiled from a number of sources, including the US Census Bureau, American Veterinary Medical Association, State of California Department of Finance, and State of California Veterinary Medical Board. The distribution of veterinarians in California was contrasted with other health professionals in California and with that of veterinarians in other states. Recent changes in veterinary medical demographics in California were quantified and used to develop in-state projections about the supply of veterinarians for the next 20 years. Results - Although California is the most populous of the 50 states, only 7 states had fewer veterinarians per capita. Furthermore, California ranked next to last among states in increase of number of veterinarians between 1990 and 1995. Los Angeles County had the smallest per-capita number of veterinarians among 9 populous California counties. During that period, California had a net gain of only 6 veterinarians who were exclusively or predominantly large-animal or mixed-animal practitioners. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - If current trends continue, the per-capita number of veterinarians will continue to decrease in California. To maintain the current ratio of 17.8 veterinarians/100,000 people in California in the future, we estimate that an additional 50 veterinarians above the currently predicted increase will be required annually.",

Sequence data-sets were assembled for 55 CSFVs comprising 150 nucleotides of the 5' non-translated region, 190 nucleotides of the E2 envelope glycoprotein gene and 409 nucleotides of the NS5B polymerase gene. Phylogenetic analysis of each data-set revealed similar groups and subgroups. For closely related viruses, the more variable or larger data-sets gave better discrimination, and the most reliable classification was obtained with sequence data from the NS5B region. No evidence was found for intertypic recombination between CSFVs. A larger data-set was also analysed comprising 190 nucleotides of E2 sequence from 100 CSFVs from different parts of the world, in order to assess the extent and global distribution of CSFV diversity. Additional groups of CSFV are evident from Asia and the nomenclature of Lowings et al. (1996) [Lowings, P., Ibata, G., Needham, J., Paton, D., 1996. J. Gen. Virol. 77, 1311-1321] needs to be updated to accommodate these. A tentative assignment, adapting rather than overturning the previous nomenclature divides CSF viruses into three groups with three or four subgroups: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3; 2.1, 2.2, 2.3; 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4. The expanding data-base of CSFV sequences should improve the prospects of disease tracing in the future, and provide a basis for a standardised approach to ensure that results from different laboratories are comparable.

Method A partial-budgeting analysis was carried out by means of a stochastic simulation model, which allows inputs to be described as distributions rather than as fixed values, and hence permits variation between farms to be considered in the analysis. Results The results show that control of nematode parasites by use of an effective anthelmintic provides the highest net returns, yielding a margin over ineffectively treated lambs of A$114 per 100 lambs on average. Suppressive treatment based on the administration of two controlled-release capsules and monthly with moxidectin resulted in an average loss of A$131 per 100 lambs in comparison with animals treated with an ineffective anthelmintic. Analysis of the results from capsule-treated lambs did not take into account the unmeasured benefits associated with less contamination of pastures. Sensitivity analysis using a stochastic model indicates that apart from the effect of treatment on weight gain variation in carcase price greatly influences the profitability of all the parasite control programs examined. Conclusion The results suggest that it is economically important for farmers to adjust their strategy in the presence of anthelmintic resistance. But as a result of uncertainty in the factors influencing economic return, the expected economic benefit is likely to vary substantially.","Anthelmintics; Economic modelling; Nematodes; Resistance; Sheep"

These drugs, including mitotane (Lysodren®), chlorambucil (Leukeran®), and azathioprine (Imuran®), are usually teratogenic but can also be mutagenic and carcinogenic. The principle governing working with cytotoxics is to keep exposure as low as possible (the ALARA principle, as low as reasonably achievable). The Dutch Arbo-wet (Factories Act) requires that employer and employee restrict exposure to a minimum. This necessitates relatively expensive facilities, trained personnel, and good procedures. The owners and other people close to the patient are also potentially at risk and should be told of this and informed about drug administration and the disposal of faeces, vomit, urine, saliva, and blood. The prescription and/or administration of cytotoxic drugs, including those that are used as immunosuppressive agents in veterinary medicine, should be restricted to specialist veterinarians who have adequate knowledge and appropriate facilities to work with these agents.

Most of the clinically observable abnormalities produced by the disruption of renal function are influenced by dietary intake of calories, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, protein, or acid load. Further, the kidney is susceptible to self-perpetuating injury, an inherent property of this organ, and the extent of this injury can be modified by adjustments in dietary intake of phosphorus and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The response of each animal with renal insufficiency to the disease and to nutritional intervention varies dramatically, and individualized therapy is required; the only constant nutritional characteristic of renal insufficiency is inappetance and loss of body weight. Successful interventional nutrition must take all of these principles into account.",

Design - Retrospective case series. Animals - 60 dogs with nasal aspergillosis. Procedure - Information including signalment, history, diagnostics, treatment method, and outcome was retrieved from medical records of dogs with nasal aspergillosis treated between 1990 and 1996 at the University of California School of Veterinary Medicine or cooperating referral practices. Final outcome was determined by telephone conversations with owners and referring veterinarians. Images obtained before treatment were subjectively assessed to develop an algorithm for predicting outcome. Results - Clotrimazole solution (1%) was infused during a 1-hour period via catheters surgically placed in the frontal sinus and nose (27 dogs) and via nonsurgically period catheters in the nose (18). An additional 15 dogs received 2 to 4 infusions by either route. Topical administration of clotrimazole resulted in resolution of clinical disease in 65% of dogs after 1 treatment and 87% of dogs after one or more treatments. The scoring system correctly classified dogs with unfavorable and favorable responses 71 to 78% and 79 to 93% of the time, respectively. Clinical Implications - Topical administration of clotrimazole, using either technique, was an effective treatment for nasal aspergillosis in dogs. Use of non-invasive intranasal infusion of clotrimazole eliminated the need for surgical trephination of frontal sinuses in many dogs and was associated with fewer complications.",

Data were stored in a relational database. Results - 25 veterinarians actively submitted case material. On the basis of analysis by region and school of veterinary medicine attended, these veterinarians were representative of all small animal practitioners in the United States. During the 6-month study, 621 case reports were submitted. Analysis of results included determination of number of dogs, with proportions calculated for primary reason for death, primary clinical sign, and breed, as well as creation of a map depicting distribution of the practitioners. Additional data were obtained for analysis to provide information of interest. Clinical Implications - A national database representative of dogs examined by small animal practitioners would be a valuable source of information.

DESIGN: A prospective study was made of 124 thoroughbred racehorses with unilateral or bilateral SDF tendonitis. PROCEDURE: The flexor tendons were assessed by physical and ultrasonographic examination before treatment, and the lesions detected in affected tendons were characterised according to lesion type, length and cross-sectional area. Ninety three horses were managed non-surgically and 31 by superior check desmotomy. Recurrent or new injuries were defined as injuries affecting a previously injured superficial digital flexor tendon, the contralateral SDF tendon, or the suspensory ligament (interosseous muscle) in either forelimb. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found in ultrasonographic lesion severity between treatment groups. Horses managed by superior check desmotomy were 1.3 times more likely to complete five or more races than horses managed non-surgically (95% confidence limits 0.93-1.82). Horses treated surgically were 1.2 times more likely to develop recurrent or new injuries after returning to training than horses managed non-surgically (95% CL 0.95-1.55). Horses undergoing superior check desmotomy were 5.5 times more likely to develop suspensory desmitis than horses treated non-surgically (95% CL 1.13-26.4). There was no difference in the time to recurrent or new injury between treatment groups. CONCLUSION: There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups in the proportions of horses able to complete five or more races after an episode of superficial digital flexor tendonitis. Superior check desmotomy did not appear to offer an advantage over non-surgical treatment in preventing recurrent or new injuries in Thoroughbred racehorses. Horses undergoing superior check desmotomy appeared to be at greater risk of developing suspensory ligament injuries than horses managed non-surgically.",

To describe 7 cases of acute postoperative azotemia in dogs and to examine by use of a case-control study the possible association between this complication and administration of nafcillin. Design. Retrospective and case-control study. Animals. 7 case dogs and 28 matched control dogs. Procedure. Cases of acute renal failure or acute renal insufficiency were identified by retrospective study of records of dogs treated between July 1, 1992, and Feb 28, 1995, and from information received rom a practitioner. A random sample of records of dogs undergoing invasive procedures between Dec 1, 1992, and Nov 30, 1993, was examined to determine the prevalence of nafcillin use. Each case dog was matched with 4 control dogs, and data were subjected to logistic regression analysis, employing exact conditional inference on the parameter estimates. Results. Case dogs were between 1 and 9 years old and weighed between 21 and 60 kg. Preoperatively, none of the dogs had a history of renal disease, and BUN concentrations, hematocrit, and plasma protein concentrations were within reference ranges. Postoperatively, each dog became azotemic and had clinical signs consistent with uremia. Hyponatremia was recorded in 6 case dogs. One dog did not respond to treatment and was euthanatized. Two dogs had persistent isosthenuria, and 4 dogs recovered. Nafcillin was used in approximately 502 of 2,184 (23%) dogs that underwent invasive procedures between Dec 1, 1992, and Nov 30, 1993. The use of nafcillin ceased on Nov 30, 1993, and no further cases were recorded in the following 15 months. In the case-control study, the only factor that was significantly associated with the occurrence of acute postoperative azotemia was administration of nafcillin. Clinical Implications. Intraoperative use of nafcillin may be associated with development of acute postoperative azotemia in dogs.",

These agents work through the inhibition of DNA gyrase, interfering with the supercoiling of bacterial chromosomal material. As a result, these agents are rapidly bactericidal primarily against gram-negative bacteria, mycoplasma, and some gram-positive bacteria, with most having little to no activity against group D streptococci and obligate anaerobic bacteria. Resistance develops slowly and is almost always chromosomal and not plasmid-mediated. However, development of resistance to the fluoroquinolones and transfer of that resistance among animal and human pathogens have become a hotly debated issue among microbiologists. The fluoroquinolones are a current antimicrobial class whose use in veterinary medicine is being scrutinized. From a pharmacokinetic perspective, these agents are variably but well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and almost completely absorbed from parenteral injection sites, and they are well distributed to various tissues in the body. The fluoroquinolones are metabolized and renally excreted, with many of them having approximately equal excretion by the hepatic and the renal excretory systems. The primary toxicity observed at therapeutic doses involves the gastrointestinal system and phototoxicity, although at higher doses central nervous system toxicity and ocular cataracts are observed. Administration to immature animals may result in erosive arthropathies at weight-bearing joints, and administration of high doses to pregnant animals results in maternotoxicity and occasionally embryonic death. The fluoroquinolones are approved for indications such as urinary tract infections and soft tissue infections in dogs and cats and colibacillosis in poultry. Approval for bovine respiratory disease in the United States is being sought. Other indications for which the fluoroquinolones have been used in animal health include deep-seated infections, prostatitis, and other bacterial infections resistant to standard antimicrobial therapy.",

Group 1 calves were dosed at 7 days of age and at 1 and 3 months of age; group 2 calves were dosed at 6 and 9 months of age. Blood samples were obtained serially from each calf, and plasma samples were analysed using an HPLC assay that converts ceftiofur and all desfuroylceftiofur metabolites to desfuroylceftiofur acetamide. C(max) values were similar in all calves, and were no higher in younger calves than in older calves. Plasma concentrations remained above 0.150 μg ceftiofur free acid equivalents/mL for 72 h in 7-day-old calves, but were less than 0.150 μg/mL within 48 h following IV or IM injection for 6- and 9-month-old calves. Intramuscular bioavailability, assessed by comparing the model-derived area under the curve (AUC(mod)) from IM and IV injection at each age, appeared to be complete. After IV administration, the AUC(mod) in 7-day-old and 1-month-old calves (126.92 ± 21.1 μg · h/mL and 135.0 ± 21.6 μg · h/mL, respectively) was significantly larger than in 3-, 6- and 9-month-old calves (74.0 ± 10.7 μg · h/ml, 61.0 ± 17.7 μg · h/mL and 68.5 ± 12.8 μg · h/mL, respectively; P < 0.0001). The V(d)((ss)) decreased linearly within the first 3 months of life in cattle (0.345 ± 0.0616 L/kg, 0.335 ± 0.919 L/kg and 0.284 ± 0.0490 L/kg, respectively; P = 0.031), indicative of the decreasing extracellular fluid volume in maturing cattle. The Cl(B) was significantly smaller in 7-day-old and 1-month-old calves (0.0178 ± 0.00325 L/h · kg and 0.0167 ± 0.00310 L/h · kg, respectively) than in 3-, 6- and 9-month-old calves (0.0303 ± 0.0046 L/h · kg, 0.0398 ± 0.0149 L/h · kg and 0.0330 ± 0.00552 L/h · kg, respectively; P ≤ 0.001). This observation may be indicative of maturation of the metabolism and/or excretion processes for ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur metabolites. The approved dosage regimens for ceftiofur sodium of 1.1-2.2 mg/kg administered once daily for up to 5 consecutive days will provide plasma concentrations above the MIC for bovine respiratory disease pathogens for a longer period of time in neonatal calves than in older calves. Peak plasma concentrations of ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur metabolites were no higher in neonatal calves than in more mature cattle, highly suggestive that peak tissue concentrations would be no higher in neonatal calves than in more mature cattle.",

Three groups of 4 normal dogs each (group 1, 15 to 20 kg; group 2, 21 to 30 kg; group 3, 31 to 40 kg) were exercised on a treadmill at a 16% grade at 1, 2, and 3 miles per hour, and at a 22% and a 26% grade at 3 miles per hour (5 total exercise levels) until blood lactate concentration increased to a value greater than 1 mmol/L. Blood lactate concentration and blood gas tensions were measured 5 and 15 minutes after starting exercise, and cardiac output was measured between 8 and 10 minutes of exercise. Results indicated that the same exercise protocol could be used for dogs ranging in size from 15 to 40 kg. Blood lactate concentration increased in normal dogs at varying workloads, but always at or above a workload of 3 miles per hour at a 16% grade. Dogs with class IV heart failure always experienced an increase in blood lactate concentration when walked at 1 mile per hour at a 16% grade for 5 minutes. A femoral vein Po 2 between 21 and 24 mm Hg in normal dogs, and between 16 and 22 mm Hg in dogs with heart failure was always associated with an increase in blood lactate concentration. The primary problem with this exercise protocol was the unwillingness of some dogs to walk on the treadmill during the preselection phase. We conclude that we have devised a submaximal exercise test that can be used to evaluate exercise capability in dogs ranging in size from 15 to 40 kg, that the described exercise protocol can be used to identify decreased flow reserve in dogs with class IV heart failure induced by rapid ventricular pacing, and that either femoral vein oxygen tension or blood lactate concentration can be used as the endpoint for submaximal exercise testing in dogs.

Two oral formulations were studied, an oil‐based paste containing micronised rac‐KTP and powder from the same source in hard gelatin capsules, each at a dose rate of 2.2 mg/kg. For the oil‐based paste two feeding schedules were used; horses were either allowed free access to food or access to food was restricted for 4 h before and 5 h after dosing. The drug in hard gelatin capsules was administered to horses with restricted access to food. After intravenous administration of rac‐KTP, S(+) enantiomer concentrations exceeded those of the R(‐) enantiomer. For S(+) and R(‐)KTP. respectively, pharmacokinetic parameters were, t1/2β 0.99 ± 0.14 h, 0.70 ±0.13 h;C/B 0.56±0.09,0.92±0.20 L/h/kg; Vd(ss), 0.53 ±0.11.0, 61±0.10L/kg. Following oral administration of rac‐KTP as the oil‐based paste to horses with free access to food, there were no detectable concentrations in plasma in three animals at any sampling time, while a fourth animal showed very low concentrations at two sampling times only. In the two remaining horses very low but detectable concentrations were present for 5 h. In the horses with restricted access to food, rac‐KTP paste administration produced higher concentrations in plasma. However, bioavailability was very low, 2.67 ± 0.43 and 5.75 ± 1.48% for R(‐) and S(+)KTP, respectively. When administered as pure drug substance in hard gelatin capsules, absorption of KTP was fairly rapid, but incomplete. Bioavailability was 50.55 ± 10.95 and 54.17 ±9.9% for R(‐) and S(+)KTP, respectively. This study demonstrates that rac‐KTP had a modest bioavailability when administered as a micronised powder in hard gelatin capsules to horses with restricted access to food. When powder from the same source was administered as an oil‐based paste, it was for practical purposes not bioavailable, regardless of the feeding schedule. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Once the disease became progressive, second-line chemotherapy was instituted. Age, sex, weight, clinical stage, performance grade, immunophenotype, and malignancy grade assigned according to the National Cancer Institute's Working Formulation were not associated with complete response rate. However, malignancy grade assigned according to the Kiel classification was found to be associated with complete response rate; dogs with high-grade malignancies had a significantly higher complete response rate than did dogs with low-grade malignancies. By means of multivariate analysis, clinical stage and immunophenotype were found to be prognostic factors for time to relapse (among dogs that had had a complete response) and survival time. In addition, malignancy grade assigned according to the Kiel classification was found to be a prognostic factor for time to relapse; whereas, malignancy grade assigned according to the Working Formulation was determined to be a prognostic factor for survival time.",

Platelet aggregation was assessed after addition of serum from healthy dogs (n = 5) or dogs with ITP (n = 15) to platelet‐rich plasma from a healthy donor dog. The aggregation responses to adenosine diphosphate, thrombin, and collagen/epinephrine were measured as the maximum aggregation observed after 2 minutes. In 13 of 15 dogs with ITP, maximal aggregation was significantly inhibited in response to ADP, thrombin, or collagen/epinephrine. The slope of the aggregation curve was decreased after addition of serum from 9 of 15 patients. A polyclonal rabbit anti—dog platelet antiserum induced inhibition of aggregation with all 3 agonists. Serum from control dogs neither inhibited nor activated platelet aggregation. Aggregation experiments were repeated with all 3 agonists after addition of patient immunoglobulin (lg)G or IgG from a healthy dog to platelet‐rich plasma. The IgG fraction from 9 of 10 dogs with ITP suppressed platelet aggregation. The IgG fraction from polyclonal rabbit anti—dog platelet antiserum inhibited platelet aggregation with all agonists. These results suggest that many canine ITP patients have circulating antibodies that, in addition to causing platelet destruction, may cause platelet dysfunction. © 1994 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine",

The PIFA was performed on 10 healthy dogs with normal platelet counts; 76 thrombocytopenic dogs, 20 of which were suspected of having ITP; and 18 dogs with other diseases and normal platelet counts. All normal dogs had negative test results. Fourteen (70%) of 20 dogs suspected of having ITP had positive test results. Fifteen of the remaining 56 thrombocytopenic dogs had positive test results, 9 had cancer and 6 had other immune‐mediated diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In this study, the PIFA assay seemed to be more sensitive (70%) than the megakaryocyte immunofluorescence assay (41 %) in the diagnosis of ITP. Of the 9 PIFA‐positive dogs with neoplasia, 6 had lymphoproliferative disorders. The PI FA was positive in 5 of 18 diseased dogs with normal platelet counts. There was an inverse relationship between the platelet count and the intensity of fluorescence in the PIFA‐positive dogs.

Duration of antigen‐induced hyperresponsiveness in horses with allergic respiratory disease and possible links with early airway obstruction. J. vet. Pharmacol. Therap. 16, 469–476. Antigen‐induced airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic horses has previously been demonstrated when clinical signs of acute airway obstruction were apparent, as a consequence of exposure of animals to hay and straw for variable periods of time, and repeat measurements of hyperresponsiveness have been made no earlier than 1 week after challenge. In the present study airway responsiveness to methacholine has been measured in normal horses and allergic horses in clinical remission before and 24, 48 and 72 h after a hay and straw challenge of fixed, short, duration (7 h). Correlations between early increases in interpleural pressure and hyperresponsiveness have also been investigated. As in other studies, the mean airway responsiveness of groups of normal and allergic horses in clinical remission was not significantly different. The responsiveness to methacholine of allergic, but not normal, horses was increased after antigen challenge and was significantly greater than that of normal horses at 48 and 72 h after challenge (log PD8 cm: ‐0.77 ± 0.28 vs. 0.27 ± 0.14 at 48 h and ‐0.6 ± 0.25 vs. 044 ± 01 at 72 h; P &lt; 0.05). There was also a significant correlation between interpleural presssure at the end of the 7‐h challenge in allergic horses and the increase in responsiveness to methacholine at 24, 48 and 72 h. These results demonstrate that antigen induces an increase in airway responsiveness in allergic horses that persists for up to 3 days and which may be linked to the initial increase in interpleural pressure.

Cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had a significantly increased serum growth hormone concentration when compared with normal cats and cats with other cardiac disease. The serum growth hormone concentration in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was less than that previously reported in cats with growth hormone secreting pituitary tumors. Pituitary tumors were not identified in eight of the cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy examined at necropsy. An increased serum growth hormone concentration may be measured in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but it is unclear if the increased serum growth hormone concentration is a cause or effect of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

They have been used in recent years for a wide variety of purposes, including town planning and environmental resource management. The technology has many features which make it ideal for use in animal disease control, including the ability to store information relating to demographic and causal factors and disease incidence on a geographical background, and a variety of spatial analysis functions. A number of possible veterinary applications are suggested, and three examples of the use of GIS in New Zealand are discussed.",

Significant echocardiographic improvement in ventricular systolic function was observed after 3 days of administration of milrinone and at the patients' last echocardiographic observation (day 21in 25 subjects, day 7 in 2 subjects, and day 3 in 2 subjects). Echocardiographic shortening fraction at the initial measurement had a median increase of 6.14%(P < 0.001), and for the last observation a 2.83% increase (P < 0.005). Most patients also showed improvement in their clinical signs as assessed by the veterinarian (72%) and by owner's evaluation (81%). No consistent problem or adverse reaction to milrinone was observed, except for a small number ofclinically manageable ventricular dysrhythmias. Milrinone appears in this trialto be effective for the treatment of advanced CHF in dogs. © 1990 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine",

Tissue concentrations of clindamycin after multiple oral doses in normal cats. J. vet. Pharmacol. Therap. 13, 270–277. Eighteen normal cats were randomly allocated into two blocks with three treatment groups and dosed orally with clindamycin aqueous solution for 10 days at a dosage rate of 5.5 mg/kg twice daily (Group 1), 11 mg/kg twice daily (Group 2), or 22 mg/kg once daily (Group 3). At the end of dosing, all cats were killed and tissues were taken for clindamycin concentration analysis. Clindamycin was extracted from tissues using solid‐phase extraction columns followed by microbiological assay of clindamycin using a cylinder plate assay using M. luteus. Recovery from each tissue was determined by inoculating known concentrations of clindamycin into drug‐naive tissues and comparing the observed concentration from the expected concentration. Confirmation that the bioassay detected clindamycin and not N‐desmethylclindamycin, its active metabolite, was done using gas‐chromatography‐mass‐spectrometry. Concentrations were highest in the lung, with tissue: serum ratios greater than 3 in all groups. Concentrations were higher in Group 3 than Group 1 (P< 0.05). Only liver concentrations in Group 3 were statistically higher than in Group 2, although all tissues except bone marrow and CSF had numerically higher concentrations in Group 3 than Group 2. The tissuerserum ratio was < 1 in all tissues studied except bone, cerebrospinal fluid, brain, and skeletal muscle.

The very nature of any discussion of legal issues, especially a discussion of case law in which someone is always suing somebody else, exaggerates the true-life situation. Although it is everyone's hope that they will not be involved in litigation, it is wise to be aware of the problems that may arise in connection with zoonotic diseases.",

One group of eight dogs was treated orally with azathioprine and prednisone; another group of eight dogs was treated orally with cyclosporine and prednisone. Four dogs of each group received four blood transfusions each prior to surgery. Mean survival time was nearly the same in the azathioprine‐treated and the cyclosporine‐treated dogs. Transfusions prolonged survival in the azathioprine‐treated group but not in the cyclosporine‐treated group. Retrospective measurement of whole blood trough cyclosporine concentrations indicated marked variation between dogs and in the same dog at different times. This variation may have influenced graft survival. Only one dog survived the 9‐month period of observation, indicating that refinements of the techniques used in this study will be required for long‐term survival of renal allografts in unrelated mongrel dogs. © 1987 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine",

Hemodynamics were measured using a Swan‐Ganz catheter and femoral artery puncture along with recording an M‐mode echocardiogram. Cardiac index increased from 1.92 ± 0.54 to 3.06 ± 0.81 L/min/m2, stroke volume index increased from 11.3 ± 4.3 to 16.7 ± 6.3 ml/beat/m2, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased from 23 ± 8 to 12 ± 8 mmHg. A clinically significant increase in heart rate was observed in seven dogs, resulting in a statistically significant increase in heart rate for the group from 174 ± 34 to 194 ± 44 beats/minute. Mean arterial blood pressure did not change significantly for the group but did decrease more than 20 mmHg in three dogs, suggesting a predominant primary vasodilating effect of milrinone in these dogs. An increase in contractility appeared to be the predominant reason for the improved hemodynamics in seven dogs. Eight dogs died of causes other than worsening heart failure, including four of eight Doberman pinschers that died suddenly, presumably from an acute tachyarrhythmia. Two dogs that had the greatest increase in an index of contractility are alive more than 2 years after the initiation of milrinone administration. © 1987 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine",
