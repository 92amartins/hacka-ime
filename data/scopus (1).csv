They are relevant to a wide variety of disciplines such as physics, chemistry, engineering, among others. Generally, the fluidized beds are characterized by different flow regimes such as particulate, bubbling, slugging, turbulent, fast fluidization, and pneumatic conveying. Here, we report the experimental study of the structural evolution of a granular system due to simultaneous penetration of intruders in the presence of an upward airflow. We found that the granular medium evolves from the static state to the turbulent regime showing the coexistence of three regions in different flow regimes. Interestingly, the cooperative dynamic of intruders correlate with the formation of such regions. As a non-invasive method, we use lacunarity and fractal dimension to quantitatively describe the patterns arising within the system during the different stages of the penetration process. Finally, we found that our results would allow us to relate the evolution of the visual patterns appearing in the process with different physical properties of the system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fractals and lacunarity; Granular systems; Penetration","Flow of fluids; Fluid dynamics; Fluidization; Fractal dimension; Fractals; Granular materials; Noninvasive medical procedures; Particles (particulate matter); Cooperative dynamics; Granular system; Lacunarity; Noninvasive methods; Penetration; Penetration process; Pneumatic conveying; Structural evolution; Fluidized beds"

Based on the inverse analysis of transient heat transport in the calorimeter, the proposed technique enables reconstruction of fast heat evolving processes. A practical utilization of the developed method is demonstrated for the heat evolution in lime hydrate-water- and Portland cement–water systems where the computational assessment makes it possible to find seven to twelve times higher initial-peak heat power values than the calorimetric measurements. The high level of agreement of original experimental data with its computational representation, R2 = 0.9984 for the lime hydrate-water system and R2 = 0.9992 for the Portland cement–water system, confirms an overall good accuracy of the model. The capability of the developed computational method to correct intrinsic distortions, which are characteristic for specific calorimetric techniques, such as the heat consumption by device components and signal delay, makes good prerequisites for its applications in physics, chemistry, and engineering. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Calorimetric measurements; Computational method; Data reconstruction; Fast heat evolving processes; Inverse analysis",

The data analysis presents that the dominant reaction coordinate of the BFP chromophore is driven by a rotation motion around the CC double bridging bond, which is in remarkable difference with a previous result which supports a Hula-Twist rotation pattern. Such behavior is consistent with the double bond rotation pattern of the GFP neutral chromophore. In addition, the dynamics simulations give an estimated decay time of 1.1 ps for the S1 state, which is agrees well with the experimental values measured in proteins. The present work offers a straightforward understanding for the decay mechanism of the BFP chromophore and suggestions of the photochemical properties of analogous protein chromophores.

We have to integrate chemistry, physics and biology to form materials, structures, components, devices, and systems at the nanoscale level. In the metric system, prefix “nano-” refers to one-billionth (0.000 000 001 = 10−9) of the base unit. In the nanoscale, at least one of the particle’s dimensions (height, width, or depth) should be at less than 100 nm. At this level, the chemical reactivity changes dramatically due to the reduction of particle size. This change occurs as a function of the structure and the density of electrons in the outermost electronic energy levels. Along with the physical properties such as optical, electrical, and thermal properties, magnetic characteristics may also change which in-turn depend on the distribution of electrons in the outermost energy levels, leads to the novel optical, electrical, magnetic behaviors and changes in the surface dependent properties. Because of the increase in the surface-to-volume ratio at the nanoscale level the properties of the material become strongly dependent (controllable) on the surface of the materials. The nanomaterials may be classified in number of ways, viz., based on: (i) dimensionality (ii) surface morphology (iii) crystalline forms (iv) chemical nature (v) chemical composition (vi) magnetic behavior (vii) functionalization or (viii) applications. But none of these classifications can be considered as absolute one. They are usually composites or hybrid in nature because in majority of cases organic compounds are used to stabilize them through capping or functionalization during synthesis. Magnetic nanomaterials have giant spins, which may be described as a single magnetic domain having uniaxial anisotropy, their EMR signals can be exploited for various biomedical and many other applications. Number of biomedical applications of nanoparticles is becoming possible because of their specific physicochemical properties and controllable dimensions which range from a few nanometers to nearly tens of nanometer, due to which they come in the size range smaller than that of a plant or animal cells having submicron size domain. © Springer (India) Pvt.

This requires a limited and pre-defined set of reference data near the reaction path and generates an accurate approximation of the reference potential energy surface, on and off the reaction path. This intermediate representation can be used to generate reaction rate data, with far better accuracy and reliability than with traditional approaches based on transition state theory (TST) or variational extensions thereof (VTST), even if those include sophisticated tunneling corrections.

To minimize the possible compression and displacement of the spheres, AFM is operated in a mode rendering a constant ultralow pN force on the tip. The procedure allows us to evaluate the mean radius of nearly monodisperse submicrometer spheres of silica in their natively hydrated state in aqueous electrolyte solutions, irrespective of whether they are coagulated or not. A variation in the volume (swelling degree) of layers delimited by the AFM mean radii of these spheres in KCl solutions and their invariable mean radius in vacuum is obtained that follows a scaling power law derived in polymer physics for swellable polyelectrolyte gels and deduced previously by us from coagulation tests. This supports our former suggestion about the existence of soft polyelectrolyte gel-like layer developed spontaneously around silica surfaces and colloids.

The term ""combustion recession"" has been adopted to reflect this process dominated by ""auto-ignition"" reactions. This phenomenon is closely linked to the EOI entrainment wave and its impact on the transient mixture-chemistry evolution upstream of the lift-off length. A few studies have explored the physics of combustion recession with experiments and simplified modeling, but the details of the chemical kinetics and convective-diffusive transport of reactive scalars and the capability of engine computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to accurately capture them are mainly unexplored. In this study, highly resolved numerical simulations have been employed to explore the mixing and combustion of a diesel spray after the EOI and the influence of modeling choices on the prediction of these phenomena. The simulations are centered on a temperature sweep around the engine combustion network (ECN) spray-A conditions, from 800 to 1000 K, where different combustion recession behaviors are observed experimentally. Reacting spray simulations are performed via OPENFOAM, using a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach with a traditional Lagrangian-Eulerian coupled formulation. Two reduced chemical kinetics models for n-dodecane are used to evaluate the impact of low-temperature chemistry and mechanism formulation on predictions of combustion recession behavior. Observations from the numerical simulations are consistent with recent findings that a two-stage auto-ignition sequence drives the combustion recession process. Simulations with two different chemical mechanisms indicate that low-temperature chemistry reactions drive the likelihood of combustion recession.

Our program detects the 2D lateral positions of particles with an algorithm based on the isosceles triangle transform, and reconstructs their 3D axial positions by a fast implementation of the Rayleigh–Sommerfeld model using a radial intensity profile. To validate the accuracy and performance of our program, we first track the 2D position of polystyrene particles using bright field and digital holographic microscopy. Second, we determine the 3D particle position by analyzing synthetic and experimentally acquired holograms. Finally, to highlight the full program features, we profile the microfluidic flow in a 100μm high flow chamber. This result agrees with computational fluid dynamic simulations. On a regular desktop computer UmUTracker can detect, analyze, and track multiple particles at 5 frames per second for a template size of 201 ×201 in a 1024 × 1024 image. To enhance usability and to make it easy to implement new functions we used object-oriented programming.

Program summary Program title: UmUTracker Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/fkprs4s6xp.1 Licensing provisions: Creative Commons by 4.0 (CC by 4.0) Programming language: MATLAB Nature of problem: 3D multi-particle tracking is a common technique in physics, chemistry and biology. However, in terms of accuracy, reliable particle tracking is a challenging task since results depend on sample illumination, particle overlap, motion blur and noise from recording sensors. Additionally, the computational performance is also an issue if, for example, a computationally expensive process is executed, such as axial particle position reconstruction from digital holographic microscopy data. Versatile robust tracking programs handling these concerns and providing a powerful post-processing option are significantly limited. Solution method: UmUTracker is a multi-functional tool to extract particle positions from long video sequences acquired with either light microscopy or digital holographic microscopy. The program provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for both tracking and post-processing that does not require any programming skills to analyze data from particle tracking experiments. UmUTracker first conduct automatic 2D particle detection even under noisy conditions using a novel circle detector based on the isosceles triangle sampling technique with a multi-scale strategy. To reduce the computational load for 3D tracking, it uses an efficient implementation of the Rayleigh–Sommerfeld light propagation model. To analyze and visualize the data, an efficient data analysis step, which can for example show 4D flow visualization using 3D trajectories, is included.

Among them, VDF- and TrFE-based copolymers exhibit remarkable electroactive properties allowing their incorporation into a wide range of devices such as printed memories, sensors, actuators, artificial muscles, and energy storage devices. In a first section, a detailed overview of semi-crystalline poly(VDF-co-TrFE) copolymers and of their ferroelectric (FE) properties from the point of view of polymer chemists is supplied. In addition to the polymer microstructure that may sometimes be controlled or influenced by the synthesis strategies, physical properties such as the phase transitions, and electroactivity are also affected by processing, such as annealing for example, and film thickness for example. Building on the conclusions and understanding obtained from the first section, the effect of the introduction of a termonomer (leading to poly(VDF-ter-TrFE-ter-M) terpolymers) is detailed in a second section of this review. Modifying the terpolymer chain microstructure has a major impact on the crystalline phase of the terpolymers that may result in a relaxor-ferroelectric behavior (RFE). The distribution of the termonomer along the polymer chain, the capacity of the termonomer units to enter the crystal lattice, as well as its dipole moment govern in large part the terpolymer electroactive properties. Poly(VDF-ter-TrFE-ter-CFE) and poly(VDF-ter-TrFE-ter-CTFE) terpolymers appeared to be the best candidates for RFE properties and were thus the most studied. In two following sections, the block or graft architectures of VDF- and TrFE- based copolymers, and the various crosslinking strategies used so far for such copolymers are described. Chemical modification is indeed a very powerful tool to tune electroactive properties of copolymers or to impart additional properties. Finally, in the last section, a few examples of emerging applications for these fluorinated electroactive polymers (EAPs) are briefly discussed. This review aims to provide a comprehensive report on the use of polymer chemistry as a tool to produce better electroactive fluorinated polymers, and highlights possible opportunities and perspectives for future progress in this field. Research in this interdisciplinary field requires different kinds of expertise, ranging from organic and polymer chemistries, polymer films engineering, physics of semi-crystalline polymers and electroactivity, to the design and fabrication of electronic devices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Electroactivity; Ferroelectricity; Fluoropolymers; Radical polymerization; Structure-properties relationship; Trifluoroethylene; Vinylidene fluoride","Automotive industry; Chemical modification; Conducting polymers; Crosslinking; Crystalline materials; Ferroelectric materials; Ferroelectricity; Fluorine compounds; Fluorine containing polymers; Free radical polymerization; Membranes; Microstructure; Organic polymers; Terpolymers; Electro-activity; Electroactive properties; Interdisciplinary fields; Polymer microstructures; Semi-crystalline polymer; Structure-properties relationships; Trifluoroethylene; Vinylidene fluoride; Polymer films"

Computational chemistry will serve as primary example. So-called density functional theory (DFT) has not yet received much attention from the side of science studies, whereas the 1990s turn propelled it into the arguably most widely used theory in all of chemistry and physics. This success, I argue, is based on networked and cheaply accessible computers as well as on how DFT is socially and cognitively organized, much like the power of ants depends on their organization. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","computational chemistry; computer simulation; density functional theory; modeling; networked infrastructure",

The Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry version 3.4.1 has been coupled with physics packages from the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) (WRF-CAM5) to assess the robustness of the CAM5 physics package for regional modeling at higher grid resolutions than typical grid resolutions used in global modeling. In this two-part study, Part I describes the application and evaluation of WRF-CAM5 over East Asia at a horizontal resolution of 36-km for six years: 2001, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2011. The simulations are evaluated comprehensively with a variety of datasets from surface networks, satellites, and aircraft. The results show that meteorology is relatively well simulated by WRF-CAM5. However, cloud variables are largely or moderately underpredicted, indicating uncertainties in the model treatments of dynamics, thermodynamics, and microphysics of clouds/ices as well as aerosol-cloud interactions. For chemical predictions, the tropospheric column abundances of CO, NO2, and O3 are well simulated, but those of SO2 and HCHO are moderately overpredicted, and the column HCHO/NO2 indicator is underpredicted. Large biases exist in the surface concentrations of CO, NOx, and PM10 due to uncertainties in the emissions as well as vertical mixing. The underpredictions of NO lead to insufficient O3 titration, thus O3 overpredictions. The model can generally reproduce the observed O3 and PM indicators. These indicators suggest to control NOx emissions throughout the year, and VOCs emissions in summer in big cities and in winter over North China Plain, North/South Korea, and Japan to reduce surface O3, and to control SO2, NH3, and NOx throughout the year to reduce inorganic surface PM. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","East Asia; Multi-year evaluation; O3 and PM indicators; Regional air quality; Regional climate change; WRF-CAM5",

The authors of the report acknowledged this limitation and encouraged validation of the models using data from human wound exposures. The objective of this paper was to apply the NCRP 156 wound models to the bioassay data from four plutonium-contaminated wound cases reported in the literature. Because a wide variety of forms of plutonium can be expected at a nuclear facility, a combination of the wound models - rather than a single model - was used to successfully explain both the urinary excretion data and wound retention data in three cases. The data for the fourth case could not be explained by any combination of the default wound models. While this may possibly be attributed to the existence of a category of plutonium whose solubility and chemistry are different than those described by the NCRP 156 default categories, the differences may also be the result of differences in systemic biokinetics. The concept of using a combination of biokinetic models may be extended to inhalation exposures as well, where more than one form of radionuclide - particles of different solubility or different sizes - may exist in a workplace. © 2017 Health Physics Society.","biokinetics; dosimetry, internal; excretion, urinary; plutonium",

It has been realized in recent years that a material, in the form of an accelerated ion beam, embedded into a target specimen offers a most productive tool for transforming its properties in a controlled manner. In semiconductors particularly, where the transport behavior is determined by very small concentrations of certain impurities, implantation of ions may bring considerable changes. The present work is based on the study of the effect of krypton ion implantation on selenium nanowires. Selenium nanowires of diameter 80 nm were synthesized by template assisted electro deposition technique. Implantation of krypton ions was done at Inter University Accelerator Centre (IUAC), New Delhi, India. The effect of implantation on structural, electrical and optical properties of selenium nanowires was investigated. XRD analysis of pristine and implanted nanowires shows no shifting in the peak position but there is a variation in the relative intensity with fluence. UV–Visible spectroscopy shows the decrease in the optical band gap with fluence. PL spectra showed emission peak at higher wavelength. A substantial rise in the current was observed from I–V measurements, after implantation and with the increase in fluence. The increase in current conduction may be due to the increase in the current carriers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Electrical properties; Ion implantation; Nanowires; Optical properties; Photoluminescence",

This code (available at http://eqe.rutgers.edu) has been given the moniker of embedded Quantum ESPRESSO (eQE) as it is a generalization of the open-source Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) suite of programs. The strengths of eQE reside in a hierarchical parallelization scheme that allows for an efficient and fully self-consistent treatment of the electronic structure (via the addition of an additional DIIS extrapolation layer) while simultaneously exploiting the inherent symmetries and periodicities in the system (via sampling of subsystem-specific first Brillouin zones and utilization of subsystem-specific basis sets). While bulk liquids and molecular crystals are two classes of systems that exemplify the utility of the FDE approach (as these systems can be partitioned into weakly interacting subunits), we show that eQE has significantly extended this regime of applicability by outperforming standard semilocal Kohn–Sham DFT (KS-DFT) for large-scale heterogeneous catalysts with quite different layer-specific electronic structure and intrinsic periodicities. eQE features very favorable strong parallel scaling for a model system of bulk liquid water composed of 256 water molecules, which allows for a significant decrease in the overall time to solution when compared to KS-DFT. We show that eQE achieves speedups greater than one order of magnitude (&gt;103×) when performing AIMD simulations of such large-scale condensed-phase systems as: (1) molecular liquids via bulk liquid water represented by 1024 independent water molecules (3072 atoms with a 25.3× speedup over KS-DFT), (2) polypeptide/biomolecule solvation via (gly)6 solvated in (H2O)395 (1230 atoms with a 38.6× speedup over KS-DFT), and (3) molecular crystals via a 3 × 3 × 3 periodic supercell of pentacene (1940 atoms with a 12.0× speedup over KS-DFT).

The mean unsigned error (MUE) of revM06-L on 422 chemical energies is 3.07 kcal/mol, which is improved from 3.57 kcal/mol calculated by M06-L. The MUE of revM06-L for the chemical reaction barrier height database (BH76) is 1.98 kcal/mol, which is improved by more than a factor of 2 with respect to the M06-L functional. The revM06-L functional gives the best result among local functionals tested for the noncovalent interaction database (NC51), with an MUE of only 0.36 kcal/mol, and the MUE of revM06-L for the solid-state lattice constant database (LC17) is half that for M06-L. The revM06-L functional also yields smoother potential curves, and it predicts more-accurate results than M06-L for seven out of eight diversified test sets not used for parameterization.

The integration of atom-thick graphene into a device always involves its interaction with a supporting substrate by van der Waals forces and other intermolecular forces or even covalent bonding, and this is critical to its real applications. Graphene films on different surfaces are expected to exhibit significant differences in their properties, which lead to changes in their morphology, electronic structure, surface chemistry/physics, and surface/interface states. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the surface/interface properties is of great importance.

The various options in operation today are presented for coal-fired or waste-to-energy power plants, biomass and CO boilers. In complement, specific applications using additive components are discussed along with the amine reclaimer waste approach. The methodology and the challenges of computational fluid dynamics applied to SNCR systems are reviewed, before discussing emerging simulation techniques, as large eddy simulation (LES) of such complex systems. The modeling of the multicomponent evaporation of the liquid reagent injected for transforming NOx, as urea, and the modeling of the chemistry in the gaseous phase, are addressed for the numerical simulation of SNCR.

It is known, although, that its performance can be less than satisfactory due to limitations related to slow convergence of the series. In this article, we present a coordinate substitution scheme using a combination of Morse and sinh coordinates, well adapted for its use with cartesian normal coordinates. We derive expressions for analytical integrals for use in VSCF and VCI calculations and show that the simultaneous substitution of symmetric and antisymmetric normal coordinates by Morse and sinh coordinates, respectively, significantly improves the vibrational transition frequencies for these modes in a well-balanced fashion. The accuracy of this substitution scheme is demonstrated by comparing one and two-dimensional sections of substituted and unsubstituted QFF with ab initio potential energy grids, as well as with vibrational energy calculations using as test cases two well-studied benchmark molecules: water and formaldehyde. We conclude that the coordinate substitution scheme presented constitutes a very attractive alternative to simple QFFs in the context of cartesian normal coordinates. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","quantum chemistry; quartic force fields; vibrational structure","Calculations; Cost effectiveness; Molecular physics; Quantum chemistry; Ab initio potentials; Cost-effective methods; Quartic force fields; Substitution scheme; Two dimensional section; Vibrational energies; Vibrational structures; Vibrational transitions; Potential energy"

Previous research shows that experts have different understandings and perspectives depending on disciplinary culture, organizational affiliation, and how they more broadly look upon their role in society. From a practice-based perspective on risk management as a bottom-up activity embedded in work place routines and everyday interactions, we look, through an ethnographic lens, at the laboratory life of nanoscientists. In the USA and Sweden, two categories of nanoscientists have been studied: upstream scientists who are mainly electrical and physical engineers and downstream scientists who are toxicologists, often with a more multidisciplinary background, including physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. The results show that although the two groups of scientists share the same norms of appropriate laboratory conduct to promote safety and good science practice, they have very different perspectives on risk with nanomaterials. Upstream scientists downplay risk; they emphasize the innovative potential of the new materials to which they express an affectionate and personalized stance. The downstream scientists, instead, focus on the uncertainties and unpredictability of nanomaterials and they see some materials as potentially highly dangerous. The results highlight the ambiguous and complex role of scientific experts in policy processes about the risk and regulation of nanotechnology. © 2017 The Author(s)","Ethnography; Nanotechnology; Risk; Scientific experts",

For this purpose, it has been equipped with several programs to help the user in the preparation of the input files.

Chemical dynamics simulations can be performed by using analytical PESs or by direct dynamics, that is, by computing energies and forces “on-the-fly” by molecular structure calculations. The development of analytical PESs is, quite often, a very complex and tedious task. There are several programs in the literature that may help to develop PESs but, as far as we know, none of them show, at the same time, great generality and flexibility. Solution method : GAFit was designed to help users develop analytical potential energy functions. We made special efforts to write a code that exhibits the three features mentioned above. For this reason, we have also interfaced GAFit with the CHARMM and MOPAC programs. The former is one of the popular packages for molecular dynamics and the latter is a semiempirical quantum chemistry program that may be conveniently used for direct dynamics simulations. Because, in general, the fitting of PESs involves a simultaneous optimization of many nonlinear parameters, we have selected a genetic algorithm as the driver for the parameterizations. As shown in the paper, GAFit may be applied to other fitting problems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Force field parameterization; Genetic algorithm; Intermolecular potentials; Potential energy surfaces; Specific reaction parameters","Chemical analysis; Computer programming; FORTRAN (programming language); Genetic algorithms; Hamiltonians; Molecular dynamics; Molecular physics; Open source software; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Parameterization; Potential energy; Potential energy functions; Potential energy surfaces; Problem oriented languages; Quantum chemistry; Reaction kinetics; Surface reactions; Analytical potential energy functions; Force field parameterization; GNU general public license; Intermolecular potentials; Semiempirical Hamiltonians; Simultaneous optimization; Specific reaction parameters; Structure calculation; C (programming language)"

However, the batch production of monolayer MoTe2 has been rarely reported. In this study, we demonstrate the synthesis of large-domain (edge length exceeding 30 μm), monolayer MoTe2 from chemical vapor deposition-grown monolayer MoS2 using a chalcogen atom-exchange synthesis route. An in-depth investigation of the tellurization process reveals that the substitution of S atoms by Te is prevalently initiated at the edges and grain boundaries of the monolayer MoS2, which differs from the homogeneous selenization of MoS2 flakes with the formation of alloyed Mo−S−Se hybrids. Moreover, we detect a large compressive strain (approximately −10%) in the transformed MoTe2 lattice, which possibly drives the phase transition from 2H to 1T’ at the reaction temperature of 500 °C.

Solution method: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are stochastic search techniques that use concepts from biological evolution to search for the global minimum (or a good approximation for it) in a multidimensional problem. Applied to a priori crystal structure prediction, EAs search to find atomic arrangements that correspond to stable (low energy or enthalpy) regions of the chemical structure's potential energy landscape. The XTALOPT evolutionary algorithm is available for use and collaboration under the GNU Public License, which is an open-source license that is officially recognized by the Open Source Initiative [17]. See the publication on XTALOPT's original implementation [18] and previous version announcements [19, 20], as well as publications on XTALCOMP [21] and RANDOMDOCK [22], for more information on the method. Reasons for new version: Since the release of XTALOPT version r9 in February 2016 various bug-fixes have been made, along with the addition of several new features: • Implementation of RANDSPG [23], an algorithm that generates random crystals with specific spacegroups. This algorithm can optionally be used to create symmetric structures in the initial random generation.• Inclusion of variable formula units within XTALOPT enables the search for cells with multiple numbers of formula units within a single run.• A molecular-unit generator permits users to create single-center molecules in the unit cell during the initial generation step. Summary of revisions:RANDSPG has been incorporated into XTALOPT to allow users to define spacegroups for the initial structure generation. Variable formula units have also been included so that instead of carrying out many runs with various formula units, a single run involving a range of formula units can be performed. To create molecular-like structures during the initial generation, a molecular builder has been introduced within this version of XTALOPT.

Here, we critically review MPs with respect to the sustainability aspects of their synthesis as well as their applications that have sustainable character. Some MPs have been synthesized from monomers derived from biomass resources, but there is certainly a large potential for further developments. There are also opportunities to improve the sustainability of MP synthesis in terms of the use of solvents, catalysts, and related aspects. The applications of MPs in processes related to sustainability depend upon multiple properties. A rich and flexible chemistry is important to applications as catalysts for, among other useful reactions, the photoreduction of CO2 and selective oxidation. The (ultra)micropore volume of MPs are crucial in gas-separation applications such as CO2 capture, and the chemisorption of CO2 on MP-tethered alkylamines could offer a means to remove that gas from dilute mixtures. When it comes to the storage of H2 and CH4 in MPs for onboard use in fuel cell or biogas cars, volumetric capacity is paramount, meaning that the density of the MPs must be considered. Finally, for use in separation and purifications from liquid mixtures (aqueous or hydrocarbon-based), crosslinked MPs are more limited than the solution-processable MPs that can be more easily processed into films and membranes. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","biomass; catalysis; CH4 storage; CO2 capture; H2 storage; microporous polymers; purification; separation; sustainability","Air purification; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Catalysts; Crosslinking; Fuel storage; Hydrocarbon refining; Microporosity; Mixtures; Polymers; Purification; Separation; Sustainable development; Catalytic transformation; Further development; Gas separation process; Microporous polymers; Selective oxidation; Separation and purification; Solution processable; Volumetric capacity; Gas permeable membranes"

We investigated whether gender differences in mathematics motivation and socialisers’ perceptions impacted choices for diverse STEM careers of varying mathematical intensity. Drawing on expectancy-value theory, we tested structural equation models in which adolescents’ preferred careers related to each of physics, biology, chemistry, and mathematics were predicted by prior mathematical performance, motivations, and mothers’ perceptions. We explored potential differences in gendered processes of influence using multigroup models. Samples were 331 Australian adolescents followed from 9th to 11th grade in 1998 and 277 U.S. adolescents from 9th to 12th grade in 2009–10. In both samples female adolescents preferred biological careers more than males did; male adolescents preferred physics-related careers and also mathematical careers in the Australian sample. Mothers’ perceptions were important to female and male adolescents’ mathematics motivations; gendered motivations were more evident in the Australian sample. Mathematics interest played the strongest role in male adolescents’ preferred careers, whereas actual or perceived mathematical achievements were most important for females, demonstrating the impacts of mathematical motivations on preferences for diverse STEM careers. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Career choice; Critical filter; Expectancy-value theory; Gender; High school; Mathematics; STEM",

In this paper, we introduce and study a new optimality criteria for pointset configurations. Namely, we consider a certain weighted graph associated with a pointset configuration and seek configurations that minimize certain spectral properties of the adjacency matrix or graph Laplacian defined on this graph, subject to geometric constraints on the pointset configuration. This problem can be motivated by solar cell design and swarming models, and we consider several spectral functions with interesting interpretations such as spectral radius, algebraic connectivity, effective resistance, and condition number. We prove that the regular simplex extremizes several spectral invariants on the sphere. We also consider pointset configurations on flat tori via (i) the analogous problem on lattices and (ii) through a variety of computational experiments.

Hence, MRI is increasingly finding applications in the study of chemical reactions and processes in a diverse range of environments and technologies. This article will explain the basic principles of MRI and how it can be used to visualise chemical composition and molecular properties, providing an overview of the variety of information available. Examples are drawn from the disciplines of chemistry, chemical engineering, environmental science, physics, electrochemistry and materials science. The review introduces a range of techniques used to produce image contrast, along with the chemical and molecular insight accessible through them. Methods for mapping the distribution of chemical species, using chemical shift imaging or spatially-resolved spectroscopy, are reviewed, as well as methods for visualising physical state, temperature, current density, flow velocities and molecular diffusion. Strategies for imaging materials with low signal intensity, such as those containing gases or low sensitivity nuclei, using compressed sensing, para-hydrogen or polarisation transfer, are discussed.

Mass estimates are crucial to determine gravitational collapse conditions for the birth of new stellar objects in molecular clouds. However, most of these estimates rely on dust models that need further observational constraints to capture the relevant parameter variations depending on the local environment: From clouds to prestellar and protostellar cores. We present results of a new study of dust emissivity changes based on millimeter continuum data obtained with the NIKA camera at the IRAM-30 m telescope. Observing dust emission at 1.15 mm and 2 mm allows us to constrain the dust emissivity index, β, in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the dust spectral energy distribution far from its peak emission, where the contribution of other parameters (i.e. dust temperature) is more important. Focusing on the Taurus molecular cloud, one of the most famous low-mass star-forming regions in the Gould Belt, we analyze the emission properties of several distinct objects in the B213 filament. This subparsec-sized region is of particular interest since it is characterized by a collection ofevolutionary stages of early star formation: Three prestellar cores, two Class 0/I protostellar cores and one Class II object. We are therefore able to compare dust properties among a sequence of sources that likely derive from the same parent filament. By means of the ratio of the two NIKA channel maps, we show that in the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation, βRJ varies among the objects: It decreases from prestellar cores (βRJ ∼ 2) to protostellar cores (βRJ ∼ 1) and the Class II object (βRJ ∼ 0). For one prestellar and two protostellar cores, we produce a robust study using available Herschel data to constrain the dust temperature of the sources. By using the Abel transform inversion technique we derive accurate radial temperature profiles that allow us to obtain radial β profiles. We find systematic spatial variations of β in the protostellar cores that are not observed in the prestellar core. While in the former case β decreases toward the center (with β varying between 1 and 2), in the latter it remains constant (β = 2.4 ± 0.3). Moreover, the dust emissivity index appears anticorrelated with the dust temperature. We discuss the implication of these results in terms of dust grain evolution between pre- and protostellar cores. © ESO, 2017.","Dust, extinction; ISM: Structure; Stars: Formation; Stars: Protostars","Clouds; Dust; Electromagnetic wave emission; Giant stars; Gravitation; Dust , extinction; Dust spectral energy distribution; Gravitational collapse; ISM: structure; Radial temperature profile; Rayleigh-Jeans approximation; Stars: formation; Stars: protostars; Stars"

The non-linear optimization of coordinates is found to give much better product wavefunctions than the limited variations considered in most previous applications of SCF methods to vibrational problems. The approach is tested using published potential energy surfaces for water, ammonia, and formaldehyde. Variational flexibility allowed in the current ansätze results in excellent zero-point energies expressed through single-product states and accurate fundamental transition frequencies realized by short configuration-interaction expansions. Fully variational optimization of single-product states for excited vibrational levels also is discussed.

A finite-size scaling analysis reveals that certain critical exponents deviate from the expected 3D-Ising values as N increases. However, the deviations are consistent with previous simulations and can be attributed to the fact that the system crosses over to mean-field behavior when the molecules become too large relative to the size of the simulation box. Nevertheless, the finite-size scaling techniques provide precise predictions for the position of the critical transition. Using a previous calibration of the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, χ, we confirm that the critical point scales as (χN)c=2+cN-1/2 for large N, and more importantly we are able to extract a reliable estimate, c ≈ 1.5, for the universal constant. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Physical chemistry; Physics; Critical exponent; Finite size scaling techniques; Finite-size scaling analysis; Flory-Huggins interaction parameter; Homopolymer blends; Mean-field behavior; Reliable estimates; Universal constants; Monte Carlo methods"

The end result is a QTT-formatted matrix exponential that we evaluate through a combination of the inexact uniformization technique and the alternating minimal energy algorithm.

The contribution of cohesion in over-compacted granular materials has been challenged and replacing cohesion with interlocking has been proposed. A theory of rupture strength that includes interlocking is derived herein. The physics-chemistry concept of critical state is elaborated to accommodate granular materials, based on empirical definitions established in the fields of soil mechanics and bulk solids' flow. A surface in state space, called the critical compaction surface, separates over-compacted states from lightly compacted states. The intersection of this surface with the Mohr-Coulomb envelope forms the critical state surface for a granular material. The rupture strength of an over-compacted granular material is expressed as the sum of cohesion, internal friction and interlocking strength. Interlocking strength is the shear strength contribution due to over-compaction and vanishes at critical state. The theory allows migrations from one critical state to another. Changes in specific volume during such migrations are related to changes in mean-normal effective stress and uncoupled from changes in shearing strain. The theory is reviewed with respect to two established research programs and underlying assumptions are identified. © 2017 by the authors.","Bulk solids' flow; Cohesion; Interlocking; Internal friction; Jammed state; Over-compaction; Rupture; Slip; Soil mechanics","Adhesion; Chemical industry; Compaction; Critical current density (superconductivity); Friction; Granular materials; Internal friction; Soil mechanics; Tribology; Bulk solids; Cohesion; Interlocking; Jammed state; Rupture; Slip; Strength of materials"

The WFAT yields an expression for the structure factor in terms of a local property of the orbital in the asymptotic region. However, in general quantum chemistry approaches molecular orbitals are expanded in a Gaussian basis which does not reproduce their asymptotic behavior correctly. This hinders the application of the WFAT to polyatomic molecules, which are attracting increasing interest in strong-field physics. Recently, an integral-equation approach to the WFAT for tunneling ionization of one electron from an arbitrary potential has been developed. The structure factor is expressed in an integral form as a matrix element involving the ionizing orbital. The integral is not sensitive to the asymptotic behavior of the orbital, which resolves the difficulty mentioned above. Here, we extend the integral representation for the structure factor to many-electron systems treated within the Hartree-Fock method and show how it can be implemented on the basis of standard quantum chemistry software packages. We validate the methodology by considering noble-gas atoms and the CO molecule, for which accurate structure factors exist in the literature.

Most previous approaches studied progressing energy understanding in specific disciplinary contexts, while disregarding the relation of understanding across them. Hence, this study provides a systematic analysis of cross-disciplinary energy learning. On the basis of a cross-sectional study with n = 742 students from grades 6, 8, and 10, we analyze students’ progression in understanding energy across biology, chemistry, and physics contexts. The study is guided by three hypothetical scenarios that describe how the connection between energy understanding in the three disciplinary contexts changes across grade levels. These scenarios are compared using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results suggest that, from grade 6 to grade 10, energy understanding in the three disciplinary contexts is highly interrelated, thus indicating a parallel progression of energy understanding in the three disciplinary contexts. In our study, students from grade 6 onwards appeared to have few problems to apply one energy understanding across the three disciplinary contexts. These findings were unexpected, as previous research concluded that students likely face difficulties in connecting energy learning across disciplinary boundaries. Potential reasons for these results and the characteristics of the observed cross-disciplinary energy understanding are discussed in the light of earlier findings and implications for future research, and the teaching of energy as a core idea and a crosscutting concept are addressed. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Crosscutting concept; Disciplinary core idea; Energy; Knowledge integration",

In particular, we find a closed expression for the degree distribution of these graphs associated to uncorrelated random fields of generic dimension. This result holds independently of the field's marginal distribution and it directly yields a statistical randomness test, applicable in any dimension.

In particular, the connectivity of chemical sites within molecules, and thereby molecular structure, becomes visible by multi-dimensional NMR. Homonuclear correlation experiments are a powerful tool for identifying coupled spins. Generally, diagonal peaks in these correlation spectra display the strongest intensities and do not offer any new information beyond the standard one-dimensional spectrum, whereas weaker, symmetrically placed cross peaks contain most of the coupling information. The cross peaks near the diagonal are often affected by the tails of strong diagonal peaks or even obscured entirely by the diagonal. In this paper, we demonstrate a homonuclear encoding approach based on imparting a discrete phase modulation of the targeted cross peaks and combine it with a site-selective sculpting scheme, capable of simplifying the patterns arising in these 2D correlation spectra.

This has consequences for battery modelling and safety. A pseudo 2D electrochemical – 3D thermal model is parameterized for charging using experimental data. Substantial differences in parameters between charge and discharge are seen in the validated model. The model is used to quantify the thermal differences during charging and discharging and separate the contribution of the different battery layers.

The chemistry of PLY-based molecules began more than five decades ago, and so far, the progress has mainly involved the open-shell neutral radical state. Over the last two decades, we have witnessed the evolution of a range of PLY-based radicals generating an array of multifunctional materials. However, it has been admitted that the practical applications of PLY radicals are greatly challenged by the low stability of the open-shell (radical) state.Recently, we took a different route to establish the utility of these PLY molecules using the closed-shell cationic state. In such a design, the closed-shell unit of PLY can readily accept free electrons, stabilizing in its NBMO upon generation of the open-shell state of the molecule. Thus, one can synthetically avoid the unstable open-shell state but still take advantage of this state by in situ generating the radical through external electron transfer or spin injection into the empty NBMO. It is worth noting that such approaches using closed-shell phenalenyl have been missing in the literature.This Account focuses on our recent developments using the closed-shell cationic state of the PLY molecule and its application in broad multidisciplinary areas spanning from catalysis to spin electronics. We describe how this concept has been utilized to develop a variety of homogeneous catalysts. For example, this concept was used in designing an iron(III) PLY-based electrocatalyst for a single-compartment H2O2 fuel cell, which delivered the best electrocatalytic activity among previously reported iron complexes, organometallic catalysts for various homogeneous organic transformations (hydroamination and polymerization), an organic Lewis acid catalyst for the ring opening of epoxides, and transition-metal-free C-H functionalization catalysts. Moreover, this concept of using the empty NBMO present in the closed-shell cationic state of the PLY moiety to capture electron(s) was further extended to an entirely different area of spin electronics to design a PLY-based spin-memory device, which worked by a spin-filtration mechanism using an organozinc compound based on a PLY backbone deposited over a ferromagnetic substrate.In this Account, we summarize our recent efforts to understand how this unexplored closed-shell state of the phenalenyl molecule, which has been known for over five decades, can be utilized in devising an array of materials that not only are important from an organometallic chemistry or organic chemistry point of view but also provide new understanding for device physics. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,

Exploitation of the materials-selective binding of biomolecules is pivotal to success in these areas and may be particularly key to producing new hierarchically structured biobased materials. These applications could be accomplished by realizing preferential adsorption of a given biomolecule onto one materials composition over another, one surface facet over another, or one crystalline polymorph over another. Deeper knowledge of the aqueous abiotic-biotic interface, to establish clear structure-property relationships in these systems, is needed to meet this goal.In particular, a thorough structural characterization of the surface-adsorbed peptides is essential for establishing these relationships but can often be challenging to accomplish via experimental approaches alone. In addition to myriad existing challenges associated with determining the detailed molecular structure of any molecule adsorbed at an aqueous interface, experimental characterization of materials-binding peptides brings new, complex challenges because many materials-binding peptides are thought to be intrinsically disordered. This means that these peptides are not amenable to experimental techniques that rely on the presence of well-defined secondary structure in the peptide when in the adsorbed state. To address this challenge, and in partnership with experiment, molecular simulations at the atomistic level can bring complementary and critical insights into the origins of this abiotic/biotic recognition and suggest routes for manipulating this phenomenon to realize new types of hybrid materials.For the reasons outlined above, molecular simulation approaches also face challenges in their successful application to model the biotic-abiotic interface, related to several factors. For instance, simulations require a plausible description of the chemistry and the physics of the interface, which comprises two very different states of matter, in the presence of liquid water. Also, it is essential that the conformational ensemble be comprehensively characterized under these conditions; this is especially challenging because intrinsically disordered peptides do not typically admit one single structure or set of structures. Moreover, a plausible structural model of the substrate is required, which may require a high level of detail, even for single-element materials such as Au surfaces or graphene.Developing and applying strategies to make credible predictions of the conformational ensemble of adsorbed peptides and using these to construct structure-property relationships of these interfaces have been the goals of our efforts. We have made substantial progress in developing interatomic potentials for these interfaces and adapting advanced conformational sampling approaches for these purposes. This Account summarizes our progress in the development and deployment of interfacial force fields and molecular simulation techniques for the purpose of elucidating these insights at biomolecule-materials interfaces, using examples from our laboratories ranging from noble-metal interfaces to graphitic substrates (including carbon nanotubes and graphene) and oxide materials (such as titania). In addition to the well-established application areas of plasmonic materials, biosensing, and the production of medical implant materials, we outline new directions for this field that have the potential to bring new advances in areas such as energy materials and regenerative medicine. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,

The design and synthesis of organic DA complexes with a variety of component structures have mainly focused on metallicity (or even superconductivity), emission, or ferroelectricity studies. Further efforts have been made in high-performance electronic investigations. The chemical versatility of organic semiconductors provides DA complexes with a great number of possibilities for semiconducting applications. Organic DA complexes extend the semiconductor family and promote charge separation and transport in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In OFETs, the organic complex serves as an active layer across extraordinary charge pathways, ensuring the efficient transport of induced charges.Although an increasing number of organic semiconductors have been reported to exhibit good p- or n-type properties (mobilities higher than 1 or even 10 cm2 V-1 s-1), critical scientific challenges remain in utilizing the advantages of existing semiconductor materials for more and wider applications while maintaining less complicated synthetic or device fabrication processes. DA complex materials have revealed new insight: their unique molecular packing and structure-property relationships. The combination of donors and acceptors could offer practical advantages compared with their unimolecular materials. First, growing crystals of DA complexes with densely packed structures will reduce impurities and traps from the self-assembly process. Second, complexes based on the original structural components could form superior mixture stacking, which can facilitate charge transport depending on the driving force in the coassembly process. Third, the effective use of organic semiconductors can lead to tunable band structures, allowing the operation mode (p- or n-type) of the transistor to be systematically controlled by changing the components. Finally, theoretical calculations based on cocrystals with unique stacking could widen our understanding of structure-property relationships and in turn help us design high-performance semiconductors based on DA complexes.In this Account, we focus on discussing organic DA complexes as a new class of semiconducting materials, including their design, growth methods, packing modes, charge-transport properties, and structure-property relationships. We have also fabricated and investigated devices based on these binary crystals. This interdisciplinary work combines techniques from the fields of self-assembly, crystallography, condensed-matter physics, and theoretical chemistry. Researchers have designed new complex systems, including donor and acceptor compounds that self-assemble in feasible ways into highly ordered cocrystals. We demonstrate that using this crystallization method can easily realize ambipolar or unipolar transport. To further improve device performance, we propose several design strategies, such as using new kinds of donors and acceptors, modulating the energy alignment of the donor (ionization potential, IP) and acceptor (electron affinity, EA) components, and extending the π-conjugated backbones. In addition, we have found that when we use molecular ""doping"" (2:1 cocrystallization), the charge-transport nature of organic semiconductors can be switched from hole-transport-dominated to electron-transport-dominated. We expect that the formation of cocrystals through the complexation of organic donor and acceptor species will serve as a new strategy to develop semiconductors for organic electronics with superior performances over their corresponding individual components. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,

The structural stability of the cubic phase, however, could only be maintained by lowering the lattice parameter of the off-stoichiometric REPt3Bx (x &lt; 1), formed in the process of annealing.

For the optimal control, which requires running multiple propagations to determine the optimal pulse sequence, we used the computationally inexpensive time-dependent configuration interaction singles (TDCIS) method. TDCIS captures all of the necessary correlation of the desired processes but assumes that ionization pathways reached via double excitations are not present. MCTDHF includes these pathways and all multiparticle correlations in a set of time-dependent orbitals. The mechanism that was determined to be optimal in the Raman excitation of the Ne 1s22s22p53p1 valence state via the metastable 1s22s12p63p1 resonance state involves a sequential resonance-valence excitation. First, a long pump pulse excites the core-hole state, and then a shorter Stokes pulse transfers the population to the valence state. This process represents the first step in a multidimensional x-ray spectroscopy scheme that will provide a local probe of valence electronic correlations. Although at the optimal pulse intensities at the TDCIS level of theory the MCTDHF method predicts multiple ionization or excitation ionization of the atom, at slightly lower intensities (reduced by a factor of about 4) the TDCIS mechanism is shown to hold qualitatively. Quantitatively, the MCTDHF populations are reduced from the TDCIS calculations by a factor of 4. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,"Ionization; Molecular physics; Optical pumping; Quantum chemistry; X ray spectroscopy; Configuration interaction singles; Electronic correlation; Ionization pathways; Multi-particle correlation; Multiple ionization; Quantum optimal controls; Time-dependent hartree-fock; Valence excitations; Excited states"

This paper reviews several aspects related to physics based modeling in TFETs, and shows how the description of these transistors implies a remarkable innovation and poses new challenges compared to conventional MOSFETs. A hierarchy of numerical models exist for TFETs covering a wide range of predictive capabilities and computational complexities. We start by reviewing seminal contributions on direct and indirect band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) modeling in semiconductors, from which most TCAD models have been actually derived. Then we move to the features and limitations of TCAD models themselves and to the discussion of what we define non-self-consistent quantum models, where BTBT is computed with rigorous quantum-mechanical models starting from frozen potential profiles and closed-boundary Schrödinger equation problems. We will then address models that solve the open-boundary Schrödinger equation problem, based either on the non-equilibrium Green's function NEGF or on the quantum-transmitting-boundary formalism, and show how the computational burden of these models may vary in a wide range depending on the Hamiltonian employed in the calculations. A specific section is devoted to TFETs based on 2D crystals and van der Waals hetero-structures. The main goal of this paper is to provide the reader with an introduction to the most important physics based models for TFETs, and with a possible guidance to the wide and rapidly developing literature in this exciting research field. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","energy efficient switches; modeling and simulations; quantum transport; semi-classical transport; tunnel FETs; van-der-Waals transistors","Electric switches; Electronic design automation; Energy efficiency; Hamiltonians; Quantum chemistry; Quantum electronics; Transistors; Van der Waals forces; Classical transport; Energy efficient; Model and simulation; Quantum transport; Tunnel FET; Van der waals; Field effect transistors"

Here, a two-point and four-point probe station for measuring electrical properties of solid materials is fabricated via 3D printing utilizing an inexpensive benchtop fused-deposition modeling system and designed by standard computer-aided design software. Stainless steel tapestry needles serve as probes for contacting a sample; these are also electroplated in order to study their electrical performance, and provide a framework for discussion of electrical charge transport, contact resistance, and conductivity in materials.

Biomolecular visualization software can serve as an entryway to begin exploration of, and expose students to, protein structure-function relationships and aid in their development in basic science knowledge. In addition, technical skills and effective writing and presentation of scientific material are critical for students entering the field of bioinformatics and computational biology. Training and education utilizing biomolecular visualization software and honing writing and presentation skills are often reserved for special studies or higher-level coursework. Presenting more advanced concepts and skills that can connect ideas from introductory level classes in chemistry, biology, and physics earlier in the curriculum is imperative to success in advanced classes and application in research settings for undergraduate students. Thus, student-centered activities that can satisfy the development of new skills and critical thinking, in addition to computational knowledge and practice, provide foundational principles for developing future scientists and increasing their chances of success. By designing a one-credit hour, introduction to biomolecular visualization course, freshman biochemistry undergraduate students were exposed to higher-level thinking and application, and gained skills in biomolecular visualization and scientific presentation. In addition, biomolecular visualization and molecular modeling were used to introduce the students to the field of computational biology and computational skills such as command-line usage, unix interfaces, and parallel computing. Overall, this study discusses the benefits of introducing bimolecular visualization software early in the undergraduate education curriculum to a small pilot group and the potential for implementation on a larger scale to prepare students by providing discipline-specific foundations relevant to the use of computational tools.

Recently, we proposed a formalism that significantly simplifies analysis of bulk-mediated surface diffusion [A. M. Berezhkovskii, L. Dagdug, and S. M. Bezrukov, J. Chem. Phys. 143, 084103 (2015)]. Here this formalism is extended to bulk-mediated surface transport in the presence of bias, i.e., when the particle has arbitrary drift velocities on the surface and in the bulk. A key advantage of our approach is that the transport problem reduces to that of a two-state problem of the particle transitions between the surface and the bulk. The latter can be solved with relative ease. The formalism is used to find the Laplace transforms of the first two moments of the particle displacement over the surface in time t at arbitrary values of the particle drift velocities and diffusivities on the surface and in the bulk. This allows us to analyze in detail the time dependence of the effective drift velocity of the particle on the surface, which can be highly nontrivial. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Physical chemistry; Physics; Arbitrary values; Bulk mediated surface diffusion; Drift velocities; Particle displacement; Particle drift velocity; Surface transport; Time dependence; Transport problems; Laplace transforms"

A high angular resolution obtained using the combination of Stark deceleration and velocity map imaging allows for the observation of diffraction oscillations in the angular scattering distributions. Differences in the differential cross sections and, in particular, differences in the angular spacing between individual diffraction peaks are observed. Since the masses of D2 and He are almost equal and since D2(j = 0) may be considered as a pseudo-atom, these differences directly reflect the larger size of D2 as compared to He. The observations are in excellent agreement with the cross sections obtained from quantum close-coupling scattering calculations based on accurate ab initio NO-He and NO-D2 potential energy surfaces.

However, the diffusing entities that control each of these important dynamic processes are still unknown. The main objective of this work is to shed some light on this mystery, advancing the knowledge on this phenomenon. For that matter, we measured the crystal growth rates, the viscosity, and lead diffusivities in PbSiO3 liquid and glass in a wide temperature range. We compared our measured values with published data covering 16 orders of magnitude. We suggest that above a certain temperature range Td (1.2Tg-1.3Tg), crystal growth and viscous flow are controlled by the diffusion of silicon and lead. Below this temperature, crystal growth and viscous flow are more sluggish than the diffusion of silicon and lead. Therefore, Td marks the temperature where decoupling between the (measured) cationic diffusivity and the effective diffusivities calculated from viscosity and crystal growth rates occurs. We reasonably propose that the nature or size of the diffusional entities controlling viscous flow and crystal growth below Td is quite different; the slowest is the one controlling viscous flow, but both processes require cooperative movements of some larger structural units rather than jumps of only one or a few isolated atoms. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Crystal growth; Diffusion; Glass; Glass forming machines; Liquids; Phase separation; Supercooling; Viscosity; Viscous flow; Cooperative movement; Diffusion mechanisms; Effective diffusivities; Liquid-liquid phase separation; Multicomponent glass; Orders of magnitude; Supercooled liquids; Wide temperature ranges; Crystal atomic structure"

Accordingly, there is a growing interest in methods designed to calculate them. Recently, Landau et al. proposed a new approach to analytically dilate a single eigenvalue from the stabilization graph into the complex plane. This approach, termed Resonances Via Padé (RVP), utilizes the Padé approximant and is based on a unique analysis of the stabilization graph. Yet, analytic continuation of eigenvalues from the stabilization graph into the complex plane is not a new idea. In 1975, Jordan suggested an analytic continuation method based on the branch point structure of the stabilization graph. The method was later modified by McCurdy and McNutt, and it is still being used today. We refer to this method as the Truncated Characteristic Polynomial (TCP) method. In this manuscript, we perform an in-depth comparison between the RVP and the TCP methods. We demonstrate that while both methods are important and complementary, the advantage of one method over the other is problem-dependent.

Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) fracturing not only allows effectively breaking paper to the shale gas recovery but also could the replace of methane with carbon dioxide. In this method CO2 adsorption in the shale affects the physical and chemical structure of the shale formations. Therefore, the change of reservoir physical properties will affect the efficiency of fracturing. The main objective of this study is to investigate supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) effects on the physical structure (porosity, deformation, and mechanical properties) and chemical structure (mineral components) of the shale.

The mineral content of the shale minerals (except quartz) decreased after SC-CO2 treatment. The samples exhibited swelling strains caused by SC-CO2. At low pressures, shale deformation was mainly caused by adsorption, while deformation at higher pressures was mainly caused by pressure. After the SC-CO2 treatment, the tensile strength, triaxial compressive strength, and elastic modulus of the shale decreased. The strength decreased as the treatment time increased. The changes in the strength of shale could be explained by two mechanisms: the dissolution effect of SC-CO2 and the adsorption/pressure-induced strain. It indicate that supercritical carbon dioxide can change the characteristics of shale reservoir, and it could reduce the fracturing pressure of supercritical carbon dioxide fracturing and enhance the efficiency of fracturing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In such a lattice, the potential energy at each site depends on the neighbour sites, accordingly to the model introduced by Sutherland [16]. The Bose-Einstein wavepacket, initially at rest at the lattice symmetry center, is released. We observe a very complex time-evolution that strongly depends on the symmetry center (two choices are possible), on the potential energy landscape dispersion, and on the interaction strength. The condensate-width oscillates at different frequencies and we can identify large-frequency reshaping oscillations and low-frequency rescaling oscillations.

The minimum air temperature and absolute humidity are -80∘C and 2.576 × 10-4g·m-3 (corresponding the dew-point temperature -90∘C), respectively. Recent developments for the apparatus extend its pressure operation range down to 7 hPa (abs). When operating in such dry conditions, the efficiency in calibration is highly limited by the time of humidity stabilization in a measurement chamber: Because the water vapor pressure is very low, the adsorption and desorption of water molecules at the chamber walls have a significant effect on the spatial and temporal humidity differences in the chamber. Inhomogeneity in humidity field inside the calibration chamber increases calibration uncertainty. In order to understand how varying parameters such as pressure, temperature, inflow speed and geometry of chamber effect on stabilization time of humidity field, computational fluid dynamics simulations were developed using Comsol software. Velocity and pressure of fluid, water vapor diffusion, temperature as well as adsorption/desorption of water molecules on the chamber walls were included in the simulations. Adsorption and desorption constants for water on the measurement chamber wall were determined experimentally. The results show that the flow speed and the surface area are the dominant parameters affecting the stabilization time of a calibration chamber. It was also discovered that more homogenous water vapor concentration field is obtained at low pressures. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Calibration; Calibration chamber; Comsol; FEM; Finite element method; Humidity calibration; Multiphysics; Simulation; Surface chemistry","Adsorption; Computational fluid dynamics; Computational geometry; Desorption; Diffusion in liquids; Finite element method; Molecules; Pressure effects; Stabilization; Surface chemistry; Units of measurement; Water vapor; Adsorption and desorptions; Calibration chamber; Calibration uncertainty; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Comsol; Multi-physics; Simulation; Water vapor concentration; Calibration"

From research in science teaching, this problem is considered to be multicausal. We will focus on one of the possible intrinsically disciplinary causes. Among the first issues addressed in basic chemistry courses of scientific/technological careers are those corresponding to quantum chemistry. When the student approaches for the first time these subjects only knows classic contents of physics and chemistry. While many of the terms used in both contexts are the same, the ‘world’ and ‘objects’ referred to in classical physics not seem to be the same that those that is cited in chemistry. The fact that it would seem that the quantum chemistry depends on physical models available of the world, it adds the complication of using classical physics concepts in a context in which they no longer seem to have the same meaning. In this paper we analyze the way in which general chemistry textbook introduced the contents of quantum chemistry. Four aspects are considered: epistemologic choice, perspective of approach, use of the history and philosophy of science, and contextualisation of relations between quantum and classical concepts. We conclude that the modes of presentation in the texts do not contribute to a better understanding of the concepts of the discipline, nor of the mode in which the scientific knowledge is developed. © 2017 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Química","Meta-disciplines; Quantum chemistry; Scientific and technological careers; Textbooks",

The thermometers were developed at the National Physical Laboratory and produced by H. Tinsley and Co Ltd almost 50 years ago. Later, they were made by other companies and institutes as well, but despite this, the availability of the thermometers decreased and a new source of supply was needed. Several years ago, the Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry (TIPC), Chinese Academy of Sciences, developed its own technology for making wire of Rh-0.5 at% Fe alloy which was used in the production of new thermometers. These devices have been tested previously at INRIM (Italy) and later at INTiBS (Poland). INTiBS has carried out an investigation focused on the thermometers’ stability after thermal cycling treatment. This paper presents the results of stability tests of about 30 thermometers produced by TIPC in two batches.

The H13CO+ rotational transition was observed three times toward IM Lup between 2014 July and 2015 May with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The first two observations show similar spectrally integrated line and continuum fluxes, while the third observation shows a doubling in the disk-integrated line flux compared to the continuum, which does not change between the three epochs. We explore models of an X-ray active star irradiating the disk via stellar flares, and find that the optically thin H13CO+ emission variation can potentially be explained via X-ray-driven chemistry temporarily enhancing the HCO+ abundance in the upper layers of the disk atmosphere during large or prolonged flaring events. If the HCO+ enhancement is indeed caused by an X-ray flare, future observations should be able to spatially resolve these events and potentially enable us to watch the chemical aftermath of the high-energy stellar radiation propagating across the face of protoplanetary disks, providing a new pathway to explore ionization physics and chemistry, including electron density, in disks. © 2017.

The solution surface is exposed to positive ions or electrons in plasma. To synthesize magnetic NPs, aqueous solutions of FeCl2 or an iron electrode immersed in liquid was used to supply iron ions in the liquid. Magnetic NPs were synthesized at the plasma-liquid interface upon the electron irradiation of the liquid surface. In the case of using aqueous solutions of FeCl2, the condition of magnetic NP synthesis depended on the gas species of plasma and the chemical agent in the liquid for controlling oxidization. The amount of magnetic NPs synthesized using plasma is not very large. On the other hand, in the case of using an iron electrode immersed in NaCl solution, magnetic NPs were synthesized without using FeCl2 solutions. When plasma-assisted electrolysis was operated, the iron electrode eluted Fe cations, resulting in the formation of magnetic NPs at the plasma-liquid interface. Magnetic NP synthesis depended on the concentration of NaCl solution and discharge current. The magnetic NPs were identified to be magnetite. By using this method, more magnetite NPs were synthesized than in the case of plasma-assisted electrolysis with FeCl2 aqueous solutions.

The science content in the course is integrated with other subjects and lecturers with different subject backgrounds work together in forming an integrated and meaningful context. A phenomenographic qualitative analysis of responses to the questionnaires before and after the course is presented. The analysis indicated that many students equate science with biology (nature studies), and several did not adjust this view even though chemistry and physics were explicitly taught. Surprisingly few students were negative towards science, none after the course. However, several remain hesitantly positive. Most students described ‘what’ and ‘how’ perspectives of science, but few developed a synthesised view of science activities. However, there was a shift towards a more integrated perspective after the course. Also the quality and eloquence of the students’ responses were noticeably improved in responses given after the course.

A longitudinal sample includes weekly data on 4 authors with different RG Scores. The results suggest that high RG Scores are built primarily from activity related to asking and answering questions in the site. In particular, it seems impossible to get a high RG Score solely through publications. Within RG it is possible to distinguish between (passive) academics that interact little in the site and active platform users, who can get high RG Scores through engaging with others inside the site (questions, answers, social networks with influential researchers).

Water and temperature affect the combustion dynamics, irrespective of whether those are associated with carbon fueled motors or ecosystems, but through different chemical, physical, and biological processes. We use an ecosystem combustion equation developed with the physical chemistry of atmospheric variables to estimate and simulate fire probability and mean fire interval (MFI). The calibration of ecosystem fire probability with basic combustion chemistry and physics offers a quantitative method to address wildland fire in addition to the well-studied forcing factors such as topography, ignition, and vegetation. We develop a graphic analysis tool for estimating climate forced fire probability with temperature and precipitation based on an empirical assessment of combustion theory and fire prediction in ecosystems. Climate-affected fire probability for any period, past or future, is estimated with given temperature and precipitation. A graphic analyses of wildland fire dynamics driven by climate supports a dialectic in hydrologic processes that affect ecosystem combustion: 1) the water needed by plants to produce carbon bonds (fuel) and 2) the inhibition of successful reactant collisions by water molecules (humidity and fuel moisture). These two postulates enable a classification scheme for ecosystems into three or more climate categories using their position relative to change points defined by precipitation in combustion dynamics equations.

There are, however, no reported crystal structures to inform our understanding of the chemistry and physics because of the complex reactivity of PAHs with strong reducing agents at high temperature. Here we present the synthesis of crystalline K2 Pentacene and K2 Picene by a solid-solid insertion protocol that uses potassium hydride as a redox-controlled reducing agent to access the PAH dianions, and so enables the determination of their crystal structures. In both cases, the inserted cations expand the parent herringbone packings by reorienting the molecular anions to create multiple potassium sites within initially dense molecular layers, and thus interact with the PAH anion π systems. The synthetic and crystal chemistry of alkali metal intercalation into PAHs differs from that into fullerenes and graphite, in which the cation sites are pre-defined by the host structure. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Here, we evidence that CT dynamics can be altered by multi-layered hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) substrates. Taking triphenylene:perylene diimide dyad supramolecular self-assemblies as a model system, we reveal longer-lived CT states in the presence of HMM structures, with both charge separation and recombination characteristic times increased by factors of 2.4 and 1.7 - that is, relative variations of 140 and 73%, respectively. To rationalize these experimental results in terms of driving force, we successfully introduce image dipole interactions in Marcus theory. The non-local effect herein demonstrated is directly linked to the number of metal-dielectric pairs, can be formalized in the dielectric permittivity, and is presented as a solid analogue to local solvent polarity effects. This model and extra PH3T:PC60BM results show the generality of this non-local phenomenon and that a wide range of kinetic tailoring opportunities can arise from substrate engineering.

Computer science, and especially High Performance Computing, has become a key factor in the development of many research fields, establishing a new paradigm called computational science. Researchers and professionals from many different fields require knowledge of High Performance Computing, including parallel programming, to develop fruitful and efficient work in their particular field. Therefore, at Universitat Autònoma of Barcelona (Spain), an interdisciplinary Master on “Modeling for Science and Engineering” was started 5 years ago to provide a thorough knowledge of the application of modeling and simulation to graduate students in different fields (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Geology, etc.). In this Master's degree, “Parallel Programming” appears as a compulsory subject because it is a key topic for them. The concepts learned in this subject must be applied to real applications. Therefore, a complementary subject on “Applied Modeling and Simulation” has also been included. It is very important to show the students how to analyze their particular problems, think about them from a computational perspective and consider the related performance issues. So, in this paper, the methodology and the experience in introducing computational thinking, parallel programming and performance engineering in this interdisciplinary Master's degree are shown. This overall approach has been refined through the Master's life, leading to excellent academic results and improving the industry and students appraisal of this programme. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Agent-based models; CUDA; GPUs; Message passing; Model simulation; MPI; OpenMP; Parallel programming; Shared memory","Application programming interfaces (API); Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Education; Message passing; Parallel programming; Program processors; Students; Agent-based model; CUDA; GPUs; Model simulation; OpenMP; Shared memory; Engineering education"

We review the current state of reduced density-matrix functional theory (RDMFT). For atomic structure relaxations or ab-initio molecular dynamics the combination of density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) possesses a number of disadvantages, like the cumbersome evaluation of forces. We therefore describe a method, DFT+RDMFT, that combines many-particle effects based on reduced density-matrix functional theory with a density functional-like framework. A recent development is the construction of density-matrix functionals directly from many-particle theory such as methods from quantum chemistry or many-particle Green’s functions.

It thus shows how a technique developed in atomic physics can address a long-standing problem in chemistry.

On the other hand, an account is given of different experimental approaches to CEI, on the physical processes in light-induced Coulomb explosion and - most importantly - on the aspects that are relevant when designing and performing such an experiment. As structural chirality occurs only in polyatomic molecules, special attention will be given to multiple ionization and multi-coincidence measurements.

An ON/OFF current ratio of &gt;104 was observed in our device with the switching mechanism of charge trapping and detrapping. Using quantum-chemical calculations, we demonstrate that the interaction between polymer and NP can largely affect the electronic structure at the interface, resulting in different interfacial barrier.

High-level achievement on science education and positive attitudes toward science constitutes a crucial challenge for formal education. Several studies indicate close relationships between students' attitudes, cognitive abilities, and academic achievement. The main purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of student's attitudes toward the school discipline of Physics and Chemistry and their reasoning abilities on academic achievement on that school subject, among Portuguese 9th grade students using the data collected during the Project Academic Performance and Development: a longitudinal study on the effects of school transitions in Portuguese students (PTDC/CPE-CED/104884/2008). The participants were 470 students (267 girls - 56.8% and 203 boys - 43.2%), aged 14-16 years old (μ = 14.3 ± 0.58). The attitude data were collected using the Attitude toward Physics-Chemistry Questionnaire (ATPCQ) and, the Reasoning Test Battery (RTB) was used to assess the students reasoning abilities. Achievement was measured using the students' quarterly (9-week) grades in the physics and chemistry subject. The relationships between the attitude dimensions toward Physics-chemistry and the reasoning dimensions and achievement in each of the three school terms were assessed by multiple regression stepwise analyses and standardized regression coefficients (β), calculated with IBM SPSS Statistics 21 software. Both variables studied proved to be significant predictor variables of school achievement. The models obtained from the use of both variables were always stronger accounting for higher proportions of student's grade variations. The results show that ATPCQ and RTB had a significantly positive relationship with student's achievement in Physics-chemistry, indicating that both attitudinal and cognitive variables should be taken into account on science education as well as in educative intervention. © 2017 Vilia, Candeias, Neto, Franco and Melo.","Academic achievement; Attitude; Chemistry education; High-school; Physics education; Reasoning skills",

Hyperuniform systems have attracted recent attention because they are endowed with novel transport and optical properties. Recently, the hyperuniformity concept has been generalized to characterize two-phase media, scalar fields, and random vector fields. In this paper, we devise methods to explicitly construct hyperuniform scalar fields. Specifically, we analyze spatial patterns generated from Gaussian random fields, which have been used to model the microwave background radiation and heterogeneous materials, the Cahn-Hilliard equation for spinodal decomposition, and Swift-Hohenberg equations that have been used to model emergent pattern formation, including Rayleigh-Bénard convection. We show that the Gaussian random scalar fields can be constructed to be hyperuniform. We also numerically study the time evolution of spinodal decomposition patterns and demonstrate that they are hyperuniform in the scaling regime. Moreover, we find that labyrinth-like patterns generated by the Swift-Hohenberg equation are effectively hyperuniform. We show that thresholding (level-cutting) a hyperuniform Gaussian random field to produce a two-phase random medium tends to destroy the hyperuniformity of the progenitor scalar field. We then propose guidelines to achieve effectively hyperuniform two-phase media derived from thresholded non-Gaussian fields. Our investigation paves the way for new research directions to characterize the large-structure spatial patterns that arise in physics, chemistry, biology, and ecology. Moreover, our theoretical results are expected to guide experimentalists to synthesize new classes of hyperuniform materials with novel physical properties via coarsening processes and using state-of-the-art techniques, such as stereolithography and 3D printing. © 2017 Author(s).",,"3D printers; Biology; Gaussian distribution; High energy physics; Optical properties; Two phase flow; Cahn-Hilliard equation; Coarsening process; Gaussian random fields; Heterogeneous materials; Microwave background; Pattern formation; State-of-the-art techniques; Swift-hohenberg equations; Spinodal decomposition"

Consider the 60-year controversy sparked by Seaborg and co-workers (Diamond, R. M.; Street, K., Jr.; Seaborg, G. T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954, 76, 1461) when it was proposed that covalency from 5f-orbitals contributed to the unique behavior of americium in chloride matrixes. Herein, we describe the use of ligand K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electronic structure calculations to quantify the extent of covalent bonding in - arguably - one of the most difficult systems to study, the Am-Cl interaction within AmCl6 3-. We observed both 5f- and 6d-orbital mixing with the Cl-3p orbitals; however, contributions from the 6d-orbitals were more substantial. Comparisons with the isoelectronic EuCl6 3- indicated that the amount of Cl 3p-mixing with EuIII 5d-orbitals was similar to that observed with the AmIII 6d-orbitals. Meanwhile, the results confirmed Seaborg's 1954 hypothesis that AmIII 5f-orbital covalency was more substantial than 4f-orbital mixing for EuIII. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Americium; Chemical bonds; Electronic structure; X ray absorption spectroscopy; Biological applications; Chemical and physical properties; Chloride matrix; Covalencies; Covalent bonding; Electronic structure calculations; Orbital mixing; Scientific advances; Mixing; americium; chloride; Article; chemistry; covalent bond; crystal structure; crystallization; density functional theory; ion exchange chromatography; synthesis; X ray absorption spectroscopy"

However, the currently discussed QSH insulators usually suffer from ultrahigh vacuum or low temperature due to the small bulk gap, which limits their practical applications. Searching for large-gap QSH insulators is highly desirable. Here, the tunable QSH state of a Bi(110) films with a black phosphorus (BP) structure, which is robust against structural deformation and electric field, is explored by first-principles calculations. It is found that the two-monolayer BP-Bi(110) film obtains a tunable large bulk gap by strain engineering and its QSH effect shows a favorable robustness within a wide range of combinations of in-plane and out-of-plane strains, although a single in-plane compression or out-of-plane extension may restrict the topological phase due to the self-doping effect. More interestingly, in view of biaxial strain, two competing physics on band topology induced by bonding-antibonding and px,y-pz band inversions are obtained. Meanwhile, the QSH effect can be persevered under an electric field of up to 0.9 V/Å. Moreover, with appropriate in-plane strain engineering, a nontrivial topological phase in a four-monolayer BP-Bi(110) film is identified. Our findings suggest that these two-dimensional BP-Bi(110) films are ideal platforms of the QSH effect for low-power dissipation devices. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Bi(110) film; electric field; first-principles calculations; quantum spin Hall effect; strain engineering; topological insulator","Calculations; Crystal symmetry; Electric fields; Monolayers; Quantum chemistry; Quantum Hall effect; Quantum theory; Semiconductor doping; Strain; Topology; Effects of electric fields; First-principles calculation; In-plane compression; Low-power dissipation; Quantum Spin hall effect; Strain engineering; Structural deformation; Topological insulators; Spin Hall effect"

With atom-wide motifs repeated in one dimension (1D), they offer a privileged perspective into the physics and chemistry of low-dimensional systems. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) provide ideal environments for the creation of such materials. Here we present a comprehensive study of Te ENs encapsulated inside ultranarrow SWCNTs with diameters between 0.7 nm and 1.1 nm. We combine state-of-the-art imaging techniques and 1D-adapted ab initio structure prediction to treat both confinement and periodicity effects. The studied Te ENs adopt a variety of structures, exhibiting a true 1D realization of a Peierls structural distortion and transition from metallic to insulating behavior as a function of encapsulating diameter. We analyze the mechanical stability of the encapsulated ENs and show that nanoconfinement is not only a useful means to produce ENs but also may actually be necessary, in some cases, to prevent them from disintegrating. The ability to control functional properties of these ENs with confinement has numerous applications in future device technologies, and we anticipate that our study will set the basic paradigm to be adopted in the characterization and understanding of such systems. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","1D-AIRSS; carbon nanotubes; encapsulation; extreme nanowires; implicit nanotubes; mismatch; nanoconfinement","Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Characterization; Crystal atomic structure; Encapsulation; Imaging techniques; Mechanical stability; Nanotubes; Nanowires; Yarn; 1D-AIRSS; Ab initio structure predictions; Low-dimensional systems; mismatch; Nanoconfinements; Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNTs); Structural distortions; Structural selectivity; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN)"

In these systems, coupling and synchronization between elements is achieved by messenger molecules diffusing from one element to others that trigger and spread a chemical reaction. In nature, an important example of chemical communication and synchronicity can be found in cell populations, where the plasma membrane governs the trafficking of ions or molecules (among other mechanisms) into and out of the cells, thus dictating their collective dynamic. Herein, in a biomimetic approach, we used a microfluidic system to confine a ""chemical information generator"", consisting of the far-from-equilibrium Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, in the aqueous core of monodisperse simple emulsion microdroplets. These microdroplets were surrounded by an oil phase containing the phospholipid 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, doped with other amphiphilic molecules. Stabilized by the lipids layer contained in the oil phase, the drops could be brought in closest contact to be arranged in a 1D array, using a microfluidic device. The as-formed lipid membrane, at the contact surface, provided a diffusion path between the drops for the chemical species governing the dynamical behavior of the BZ oscillating reaction. We showed that the coupling mediated by the membranes had mostly an inhibitory character and that the communication could be controlled by the insertion of sodium tetradecyl sulfate and cholesterol as membrane dopants. Numerical simulations suggested that the hydrophobic properties and the lipid packing at the interface were of paramount importance for the transmembrane crossing of the pertinent chemical species. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Biomimetics; Cell culture; Cell membranes; Cell proliferation; Cytology; Doping (additives); Drops; Dynamics; Emulsification; Fluidic devices; Lipids; Microfluidics; Molecules; Phospholipids; Sodium sulfate; Amphiphilic molecules; Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions; Biomimetic approaches; Chemical communications; Hydrophobic properties; Micro-fluidic devices; Oscillating reactions; Sodium tetradecyl sulfates; Membranes"

MQC-IVR employs a modified Filinov filtration (MFF) scheme to control the overall phase of the SC integrand, extending the applicability of SC methods to complex systems while retaining their ability to accurately describe quantum coherence effects. Here, we address questions regarding the effectiveness of the MFF scheme in combination with SC dynamics. Previous work showed that this filtering scheme is of limited utility in the context of semiclassical wavepacket propagation, but we find that the MFF is extraordinarily powerful in the context of correlation functions. By examining trajectory phase and amplitude contributions to the real-time SC correlation function in a model system, we clearly demonstrate that the MFF serves to reduce noise by damping amplitude only in regions of highly oscillatory phase leading to a reduction in computational effort while retaining accuracy. Further, we introduce a novel and efficient MQC-IVR formulation that allows for linear scaling in computational cost with the total simulation length, a significant improvement over the more-than quadratic scaling exhibited by the original method. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Physical chemistry; Physics; Computational costs; Computational effort; Correlation function; Filtering schemes; Initial value representation; Quantum coherence effects; Semiclassical dynamics; Wave packet propagation; Quantum theory"

Over the 40 years of publication of Physics and Chemistry of Minerals, great progress has been made in the accuracy and precision of the measurements of both volumes and elastic tensors of minerals and in the pressures and temperatures at which the measurements are made. As an illustration of the state of the art, all available single-crystal data that constrain the elastic properties and pressure–volume–temperature equation of state (EoS) of mantle-composition olivine are reviewed. Single-crystal elasticity measurements clearly distinguish the Reuss and Voigt bulk moduli of olivine at all conditions. The consistency of volume and bulk modulus data is tested by fitting them simultaneously. Data collected at ambient pressure and data collected at ambient temperature up to 15 GPa are consistent with a Mie–Grünesien–Debye thermal-pressure EoS in combination with a third-order Birch–Murnaghan (BM) compressional EoS, the parameter V0 = 43.89 cm3 mol−1, isothermal Reuss bulk modulus (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), a Debye temperature (Formula presented.), and a Grüneisen parameter γ0 = 1.044(4), whose volume dependence is described by q = 1.9(2). High-pressure softening of the bulk modulus at room temperature, relative to this EoS, can be fit with a fourth-order BM EoS. However, recent high-P, T Brillouin measurements are incompatible with these EoS and the intrinsic physics implied by it, especially that (Formula presented.). We introduce a new parameterisation for isothermal-type EoS that scales both the Reuss isothermal bulk modulus and its pressure derivative at temperature by the volume, (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.), to ensure thermodynamic correctness at low temperatures. This allows the elastic softening implied by the high-P, T Brillouin data for mantle olivine to be fit simultaneously and consistently with the same bulk moduli and pressure derivatives (at room temperature) as the MGD EoS, and with the additional parameters of αV0 = 2.666(9) × 10−5 K−1, (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.) = 5.77(8), and (Formula presented.) = −3.5(1.1).

Discovery research is therefore focused on new mechanisms and modes of action. Interactions in detoxification systems also provide cross resistance and synergist and safener mechanisms illustrated with serine hydrolases and inhibitors, cytochrome P450 and insecticide synergists, and glutathione S-transferases and herbicide safeners. Secondary targets are also considered for inhibitors of serine hydrolases, aldehyde dehydrogenases, and transporters. Emphasis is given to the mechanistic aspects of interactions, not the incidence, which depends on potency, exposure, ratios, and timing. The benefits of pesticide interactions are the additional levels of chemical control to achieve desired organismal effects.

Still it fails to correctly predict quantitatively or even qualitatively for systems with significant nondynamic correlation. Several DFT functionals were proposed in recent years to treat the nondynamic correlation, most of which added the exact exchange energy density as a new variable. This quantity, calculated as Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange energy density, is the computational bottleneck for calculations with these new functionals. We present an implementation of an efficient seminumerical algorithm in this paper as a solution for this computational bottleneck. The method scales quadratically with respect to the molecular size and the basis set size. The scheme, exact for the purpose of computing the HF exchange energy density, is favored for medium-sized basis sets and can be competitive even for large basis sets with efficient grids when compared with our previous approximate resolution-of-identity scheme. It can also be used as a seminumerical integration scheme to compute the HF exchange energy and matrix on a standard atom-centered grid. Calculations on a series of alanine peptides show that for large basis sets the seminumerical scheme becomes competitive to the conventional analytical method and can be about six times faster for aug-cc-pvtz basis. The practicality of the algorithm is demonstrated through a local hybrid self-consistent calculation of the acenes-20 molecule. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,

Therefore the interaction between enzyme and DNA must be studied in aqueous solution.

OMIP aims to provide standard protocols and diagnostics for ocean models, while offering a forum to promote their common assessment and improvement. It also offers to compare solutions of the same ocean models when forced with reanalysis data (OMIP simulations) vs. when integrated within fully coupled Earth system models (CMIP6). Here we detail simulation protocols and diagnostics for OMIP's biogeochemical and inert chemical tracers. These passive-tracer simulations will be coupled to ocean circulation models, initialized with observational data or output from a model spin-up, and forced by repeating the 1948-2009 surface fluxes of heat, fresh water, and momentum. These so-called OMIP-BGC simulations include three inert chemical tracers (CFC-11, CFC-12, SF6) and biogeochemical tracers (e.g., dissolved inorganic carbon, carbon isotopes, alkalinity, nutrients, and oxygen). Modelers will use their preferred prognostic BGC model but should follow common guidelines for gas exchange and carbonate chemistry. Simulations include both natural and total carbon tracers. The required forced simulation (omip1) will be initialized with gridded observational climatologies. An optional forced simulation (omip1-spunup) will be initialized instead with BGC fields from a long model spin-up, preferably for 2000 years or more, and forced by repeating the same 62-year meteorological forcing. That optional run will also include abiotic tracers of total dissolved inorganic carbon and radiocarbon, Cabio T and 14Cabio T, to assess deep-ocean ventilation and distinguish the role of physics vs. biology. These simulations will be forced by observed atmospheric histories of the three inert gases and CO2 as well as carbon isotope ratios of CO2. OMIP-BGC simulation protocols are founded on those from previous phases of the Ocean Carbon-Cycle Model Intercomparison Project. They have been merged and updated to reflect improvements concerning gas exchange, carbonate chemistry, and new data for initial conditions and atmospheric gas histories.

There are several quantitative approaches such as rankings and indicators that have contributed to measure the progress of digital government initiatives in the public sector, but more sophisticated computational tools are usually unexploited. This article proposes a computational multi-parametric analysis of multiple metrics of digital government advance using a computational technique, the neural networks, for the analysis of the evolution of digital government ranking of Mexican states during the period 2009-2015. Neural networks analysis has been used in different areas such as scientometric performance profiles, and disciplines like physics, chemistry, management, economics and demography. The neural networks analysis helps to identify clusters of characterizations that represents digital government advance patterns of performance.

Studies have focused on the size reduction and control of the surface or interface of nanostructured materials since these approaches enhance the thermopower and phonon scattering in quantum and superlattice structures. Currently, bismuth-tellurium-based semiconductor materials are widely employed for thermoelectric (TE) devices such as TE energy generators and coolers, in addition to other sensors, for use at temperatures under 400 K. However, new and promising TE materials with enhanced TE performance, including doped zinc oxide (ZnO) multilayer or superlattice thin films, are also required for designing solid-state TE power generating devices with the maximum output power density and for investigating the physics of in-plane TE generators. Herein, we report the growth of Al2O3/ZnO (AO/ZnO) superlattice thin films, which were prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD), and the evaluation of their electrical and TE properties. All the in-plane TE properties, including the Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical conductivity (σ), and thermal conductivity (κ), of the AO/ZnO superlattice (with a 0.82 nm-thick AO layer) and AO/ZnO films (with a 0.13 nm-thick AO layer) were evaluated in the temperature range 40-300 K, and the measured S, σ, and κ were -62.4 and -17.5 μV K-1, 113 and 847 (Ω cm)-1, and 0.96 and 1.04 W m-1 K-1, respectively, at 300 K. Consequently, the in-plane TE ZT factor of AO/ZnO superlattice films was found to be ∼0.014, which is approximately two times more than that of AO/ZnO films (ZT of ∼0.007) at 300 K. Furthermore, the electrical power generation efficiency of the TE energy generator consisting of four couples of n-AO/ZnO superlattice films and p-Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 (p-BST) thin-film legs on the substrate was demonstrated. Surprisingly, the output power of the 100 nm-thick n-AO/ZnO superlattice film/p-BST TE energy generator was determined to be ∼1.0 nW at a temperature difference of 80 K, corresponding to a significant improvement of ∼130% and ∼220% compared to the 100 nm-thick AO/ZnO film/p-BST and n-BT/p-BST film generators, respectively, owing to the enhancement of the TE properties, including the power factor of the superlattice film. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Atomic layer deposition; Deposition; Film preparation; Films; II-VI semiconductors; Multilayer films; Nanostructured materials; Oxide films; Phonons; Semiconducting tellurium; Semiconductor devices; Semiconductor doped polymers; Semiconductor materials; Solid-state sensors; Thermal conductivity; Thin films; Zinc oxide; Electrical conductivity; Electrical power generation; Maximum output power densities; Power generating devices; Quantum dot superlattices; Super-lattice structures; Superlattice thin films; Temperature differences; Interfaces (materials)"

The 2011 Planetary Decadal Survey, Vision and Voyages, states: ""Because of this ocean's potential suitability for life, Europa is one of the most important targets in all of planetary science."" Exploring Europa to investigate its habitability is the goal of the planned Europa Mission. This exploration is intimately tied to understanding the three ""ingredients"" for life: liquid water, chemistry, and energy. The Europa Mission would investigate these ingredients by comprehensively exploring Europa's ice shell and liquid ocean interface, surface geology and surface composition to glean insight into the inner workings of this fascinating moon. In addition, a lander mission is seen as a possible future step, but current data about the Jovian radiation environment and about potential landing site hazards and potential safe landing zones is insufficient. Therefore an additional goal of the mission would be to characterize the radiation environment near Europa and investigate scientifically compelling sites for hazards, to inform a potential future landed mission. The Europa Mission envisions sending a flight system, consisting of a spacecraft equipped with a payload of NASA-selected scientific instruments, to execute numerous flybys of Europa while in Jupiter orbit. A key challenge is that the flight system must survive and operate in the intense Jovian radiation environment, which is especially harsh at Europa. The innovative design of this multiple-flyby tour is an enabling feature of this mission: by minimizing the time spent in the radiation environment the spacecraft complexity and cost has been significantly reduced compared to previous mission concepts. The spacecraft would launch from Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA, on a NASA supplied launch vehicle, no earlier than 2022. The formulation and implementation of the proposed mission is led by a joint Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) Project team. In June 2015, NASA announced the selection of a highly capable suite of 10 scientific investigations to be flown on the Europa Mission. Since the announcement, the Europa Mission Team has updated the spacecraft design in order to fully accommodate this instrument suite - a significant challenge. After completing a successful System Requirements Review and Mission Definition Review in January of 2017, the project is currently transitioning from the concept development phase to the preliminary design phase of the mission. This paper will describe the progress of the Europa Mission since 2015, including maturation of the spacecraft design, requirements, system analyses, and mission trajectories. © 2017 IEEE.",,

Special attention was paid to the conformation of propylene linkers in order to understand their changes in the reaction. Statistical analysis of CSD database revealed that a-a, g-a and g-g conformations may have similar stability in most cases and various complicated unpredictable non-covalent interactions may play important role in the formation of final rotamers. In order to reproduce all stable conformations and the energy barriers separating them, full range two-dimensional fully relaxed potential-energy surfaces (PES) scans of six ‘propylene linker’ dimers were calculated starting from the most stable crystal structures. The PES were scanned along both bridge C[sbnd]C single bond torsional angles (denoted as θ1 and θ2), while all other internal coordinates were optimized at the DFT/B3LYP/3-21G* level in gas phase. Then all energy minima were re-optimized again at the DFT/B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) level both in gas and ethanol solutions in order to evaluate the really stable rotamers. At last, 1D or 2D relaxed PES scans were performed between local stable rotamers to get reliable energy barriers. This method represents a less time-consuming and more reliable approach to the determination of conformational stability of propanediyl bridging chains. The combination of experimental, statistical and theoretical results shows that the observed conformation is jointly determined by the energy levels of the minima, energy barriers separating them, non-covalent interactions and somewhat randomness. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2D Fully relaxed potential-energy surface; Conformation; Crystal structure; Dimer; Propylene linker","Conformations; Crystal structure; Dimers; Energy barriers; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Rate constants; Single crystals; X ray crystallography; Bridging chains; Conformational stabilities; Ethanol solutions; Hydrolytic degradation; Internal coordinates; Non-covalent interaction; Torsional angle; X-ray crystallographic analysis; Propylene"

The detailed calculations of the isotope shifts for the three stable isotopes 24Mg, 25Mg and 26Mg are also carried out, in which the GRASP2K package is used together with another modified relativistic isotope shift computation code package RIS3. The two-parameter Fermi model is used here to describe the nuclear charge distribution in order to calculate the field shift by the first-order perturbation. A restricted double excitation mode is used in our calculations, one electron is excited from the two electrons in the 3s shell (3s2), another electron is excited from the eight electrons in the 2s or 2p shells (2s22p6), and the two electrons in the 1s shell (1s2) are not excited. The active configurations are expanded from the occupied orbitals to some active sets layer by layer, and each correlation layer is numbered by the principal quantum numbers n (n = 3; 4; 5; ⋯ ) and contains the corresponding orbitals s, p, d, ⋯. The active configurations with the mixing coefficients in the added layer can be optimized by the MCDHF calculations. In this work, the atomic state functions are optimized simultaneously by the self-consistent field method and the relativistic configuration interaction approach in which the Breit interaction is taken into account perturbatively as well. The maximum principal quantum number n equals 10 and the largest orbital quantum number lmax is g. In our calculations, the NMS coefficients are -576.8 and -359.9 GHz·u, the SMS coefficients are 133.9 and -479.6 GHz·u, and the FS factors are -62.7 and -78.0 MHz·fm-2 for the 1S0-1P1 and 1S0-3P1 transitions of Mg, respectively. The difference between our isotope shift calculations and the previous experimental measurements is in a range from 6 MHz to 20 MHz with the relative error range from 0.6% to 1.3%, which shows that our results are in good agreement with experimental values. Our calculations are also coincident with other theoretical results. The isotope shift parameters provided here can be applied to the quick calculations of isotope shifts for the short-lived Mg isotopes, including 20-23Mg and 27-40Mg, and can be referred to for the corresponding isotope shift experiments.

Advanced electronics made possible the sampling, concentration, and detection of gases and particles, both in situ and in laboratory analysis of collected samples. Accurate and precise measurements by these methods have made possible advanced air quality management practices that led to decreasing concentrations over time. New technologies are leading to smaller and cheaper measurement systems that can further expand and enhance current air pollution monitoring networks. Implications: Ambient air quality measurement systems have a large influence on air quality management by determining compliance, tracking trends, elucidating pollutant transport and transformation, and relating concentrations to adverse effects. These systems consist of more than just instrumentation, and involve extensive support efforts for siting, maintenance, calibration, auditing, data validation, data management and access, and data interpretation. These requirements have largely been attained for criteria pollutants regulated by National Ambient Air Quality Standards, but they are rarely attained for nonroutine measurements and research studies. © 2017 A&WMA.",,

It aims at understanding and exploiting unique reactivities of polymer chains confined to highly non-equilibrium stretched geometries by interactions with their surroundings. Macromolecular chains or their segments become stretched in bulk polymers under mechanical loads or when polymer solutions are sonicated or flow rapidly through abrupt contractions. An increasing amount of empirical data suggests that mechanochemical phenomena are widespread wherever polymers are used. In the past decade, empirical mechanochemistry has progressed enormously, from studying fragmentations of commodity polymers by simple backbone homolysis to demonstrations of self-strengthening and stress-reporting materials and mechanochemical cascades using purposefully designed monomers. This progress has not yet been matched by the development of conceptual frameworks within which to rationalize, systematize and generalize empirical mechanochemical observations. As a result, mechanistic and/or quantitative understanding of mechanochemical phenomena remains, with few exceptions, tentative. In this review we aim at systematizing reported macroscopic manifestations of polymer mechanochemistry, and critically assessing the interpretational framework that underlies their molecular rationalizations from a physical chemist's perspective. We propose a hierarchy of mechanochemical phenomena which may guide the development of multiscale models of mechanochemical reactivity to match the breadth and utility of the Eyring equation of chemical kinetics. We discuss the limitations of the approaches to quantifying and validating mechanochemical reactivity, with particular focus on sonicated polymer solutions, in order to identify outstanding questions that need to be solved for polymer mechanochemistry to become a rigorous, quantitative field. We conclude by proposing 7 problems whose solution may have a disproportionate impact on the development of polymer mechanochemistry. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, SA-CASSCF does not effectively recover dynamical correlation. As a result, there can be qualitative differences between SA-CASSCF potential energy surfaces (PESs) and more accurate reference surfaces computed using multistate complete active space second-order perturbation theory (MS-CASPT2). Here we introduce an empirical correction to SA-CASSCF that scales the splitting between individual states and the state-averaged energy. We call this the α-CASSCF method, and we show here that it significantly improves the accuracy of relative energies and PESs compared with MS-CASPT2 for the chromophores of green fluorescent and photoactive yellow proteins. As such, this method may prove to be quite valuable for nonadiabatic dynamics. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Chromophores; Computation theory; Computational chemistry; Computational efficiency; Large scale systems; Molecular dynamics; Molecular physics; Perturbation techniques; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Ab initio molecular dynamics; Complete active space; Complete active space self consistent fields; Dynamical correlations; Non-adiabatic dynamics; Photoactive yellow proteins; Qualitative differences; Second order perturbation theory; Hydrogen bonds"

The configurational distribution of global minima is analyzed, and the geometrical difference among these clusters is demonstrated. Results show that the dominant motif of Ni and Cu clusters is the icosahedron, and in Ag and Au clusters the number of decahedra is slightly larger than that of the icosahedra. However, more face-centered cubic (fcc), stacking fault fcc, and amorphous structures are formed in Au clusters than in Ag clusters. Furthermore, the main motif of Pd and Pt clusters is the decahedron. In particular, Ni98 adopts a Leary tetrahedral motif, and Pt54 is a central vacant icosahedron. The difference related to the potential parameters of these metallic clusters is further investigated by energy analysis. Moreover, the potential energy surfaces (PES) of 38-atom metallic clusters is characterized in terms of conformational analysis.

We find that EET from an initial site, where the excitation is inserted to the sink, is generally inefficient due to the inhibition of transport by localization of the excitation wave packet in a symmetric, fully-connected network. We demonstrate that the EET efficiency can be significantly increased up to ≈100% by perturbing hopping transport between the initial node and the one connected directly to the sink, while the rate of energy transport is highest at a finite value of the hopping parameter. We also show that prohibiting hopping between the other nodes which are not directly linked to the sink does not improve the efficiency. We show that external dephasing noise in the network plays a constructive role for EET in the presence of localization in the network, while in the absence of localization it reduces the efficiency of EET.

The chemistry subject is understudied compared to biology and physics and students view chemistry as their least interesting science subject. The Swedish national science assessments aim to support equitable and fair evaluation of students, to concretize the goals in the chemistry syllabus and to increase student achievement. Discourse and multimodal analyses, based on feminist and critical didactic theories, were used to examine the test’s norms and values. The results revealed that the chemistry discourse presented in the tests showed a traditional view of science from the topics discussed (for example, oil and metal), in the way women, men and youth are portrayed, and how their science interests are highlighted or neglected. An elitist view of science emerges from the test, with distinct gender and age biases. Students could interpret these biases as a message that only “the right type” of person may come into the chemistry epistemological community, that is, into this special sociocultural group that harbours a common view about this knowledge. This perspective may have an impact on students’ achievement and thereby prevent support for an equitable and fair evaluation. Understanding the underlying evaluative meanings that come with science teaching is a question of democracy since it may affect students’ feelings of inclusion or exclusion. The norms and values harboured in the tests will also affect teaching since the teachers are given examples of how the goals in the syllabus can be concretized. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Chemistry epistemological community; Chemistry national tests; Discourse analysis; Gender stereotypes; Norms and values",

In the last 20 years, the development of voltage-modulated scanning probe microscopy techniques, exemplified by Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and associated time- and voltage spectroscopies, opened a pathway to explore these materials on a single-digit nanometer level. Consequently, domain structures and walls and polarization dynamics can now be imaged in real space. More generally, PFM has allowed studying electromechanical coupling in a broad variety of materials ranging from ionics to biological systems. It can also be anticipated that the recent Nobel prize [“The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2016,” http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2016/ (Nobel Media, 2016)] in molecular electromechanical machines will result in rapid growth in interest in PFM as a method to probe their behavior on single device and device assembly levels. However, the broad introduction of PFM also resulted in a growing number of reports on the nearly ubiquitous presence of ferroelectric-like phenomena including remnant polar states and electromechanical hysteresis loops in materials which are non-ferroelectric in the bulk or in cases where size effects are expected to suppress ferroelectricity. While in certain cases plausible physical mechanisms can be suggested, there is remarkable similarity in observed behaviors, irrespective of the materials system. In this review, we summarize the basic principles of PFM, briefly discuss the features of ferroelectric surfaces salient to PFM imaging and spectroscopy, and summarize existing reports on ferroelectric-like responses in non-classical ferroelectric materials. We further discuss possible mechanisms behind observed behaviors and possible experimental strategies for their identification. © 2017 U.S. Government.",,"Biological materials; Condensed matter physics; Domain walls; Electromechanical coupling; Electromechanical devices; Ferroelectricity; Scanning probe microscopy; Electro-mechanical hysteresis; Experimental strategy; Ferroelectric surfaces; Physical mechanism; Piezoresponse force microscopy; Polarization dynamics; Possible mechanisms; Scanning probe microscopy techniques; Ferroelectric materials"

There are many of them-Wikipedia states that there are more than 600 known, some that contain oxygen, and others that do not. Because of the extended π electron system they absorb light in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum which in turn facilitates a Raman spectrum that is strongly enhanced. I started by describing the origin of the electronic properties by citing a description of polyene from the physics literature. I cited some studies in the field of analytical polymer chemistry where workers determined that the color that appears in thermally degraded polyvinyl chloride is a result of the evolution of HCl from the polymer and the polymer's further unzipping into a polyene. Then I discussed, in a general way, the spectra of the carotenoids. Finally, I cited a few examples of places where these spectra have been used to extract biochemical information. As always, this is not an exhaustive review. I am absolutely certain that my citations do not include everything important that has been done.

We consider the well widths wi and ws and the doping concentrations ndi and nds in the barriers along the substrate (inverted doping) and surface (surface doping), respectively. We show that for a suitable choice of ws and nds, the variation of wi leads to interesting changes in the occupation of subbands, i.e., first, single-subband, then double-subband, and again, singlesubband occupancy. By increasing ndi, the range of double-subband occupancy is enhanced. However, the lowering of μ due to the inter-subband effects is minimized. In the case of a single-channel HEMT, i.e., say, for ndi = 0, only a single subband is occupied. The mobility exhibits a cusplike behavior with a minimum at a certain value of wi. If one takes a higher value of nds, the occupation of subbands shows a different trend, i.e., from single- to double-subband occupancy as a function of wi for different ndi values with nonmonotonic variations of μ.

First, strong support for social comparisons suggested that high achievement in a particular domain enhance students' motivation in the same domain, which in turn predicted domain-specific aspirations. Particularly, self-concept significantly interacted with value to predict aspirations. Second, in the processes underlying the formation of self-concept and intrinsic value, students tended to engage in negative dimensional comparisons between contrasting domains (physics vs. biology) but positive dimensional comparisons between assimilating domains (physics vs. chemistry).

We propose a constructive graph-algorithmic approach to determine the sequence of critical timescales at which the qualitative behavior of a given Markov chain changes, and give an effective description of the dynamics on each of them. This approach is valid for both time-reversible and time-irreversible Markov processes, with or without symmetry. Central to this approach are two graph algorithms, Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, for obtaining the sequences of the critical timescales and the hierarchies of Typical Transition Graphs or T-graphs indicating the most likely transitions in the system without and with symmetry, respectively. The sequence of critical timescales includes the subsequence of the reciprocals of the real parts of eigenvalues. Under a certain assumption, we prove sharp asymptotic estimates for eigenvalues (including pre-factors) and show how one can extract them from the output of Algorithm 1. We discuss the relationship between Algorithms 1 and 2 and explain how one needs to interpret the output of Algorithm 1 if it is applied in the case with symmetry instead of Algorithm 2. Finally, we analyze an example motivated by R. D.

Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) represents one of such innovations. It refers to a unique light-emitting phenomenon, in which luminescent materials that are non-emissive in molecular state can be induced to emit efficiently in aggregated state. The design and development of AIE luminogens (AIEgens) have overcome technical and fundamental limitations that exist in conventional light-emitting materials, and thus generate great opportunities for various applications. In this review, we aim to introduce the wonderful world of AIE to scientists from different disciplines by summarizing the recent progress made in this exciting research field. The mechanistic analyses and the working principles of the AIE processes are first elaborated, which reveal the restriction of intramolecular motions as the main cause for the AIE effect. The different molecular engineering strategies for the design of new AIEgens are subsequently discussed with examples of various AIEgen systems. The recent high-tech applications of AIEgens as optoelectronic materials, chemical sensors, and biomedical probes are presented and discussed. We hope that this review will stimulate more research interest from physics, chemistry, life science, and biomedical fields to this wonderland of AIE. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Optoelectronic devices; Aggregation-induced emissions; Breakthrough innovations; Design and Development; Fundamental limitations; High-tech applications; Light emitting materials; Opto-electronic materials; Science and Technology; Light emission"

In this work, we take a closer look at the gas content or fraction and the associated star-formation rate in main sequence and starburst galaxies at z=0 and z1-2 by applying an analytical model of galactic clumpy gas disks to samples of local spiral galaxies, ULIRGs, submillimeter (smm), and high-z star-forming galaxies. The model simultaneously calculates the total gas mass, Hi/H2 mass, the gas velocity dispersion, IR luminosity, IR spectral energy distribution, CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED), HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) emission of a galaxy given its size, integrated star formation rate, stellar mass radial profile, rotation curve, and Toomre Q parameter. The model reproduces the observed CO luminosities and SLEDs of all sample galaxies within the model uncertainties (0.3 dex). Whereas the CO emission is robust against the variation of model parameters, the HCN and HCO+ emissions are sensitive to the chemistry of the interstellar medium. The CO and HCN mass-to-light conversion factors, including CO-dark H2, are given and compared to the values found in the literature. All model conversion factors have uncertainties of a factor of two. Both the HCN and HCO+ emissions trace the dense molecular gas to a factor of approximately two for the local spiral galaxies, ULIRGs and smm-galaxies. Approximately 80% of the molecular line emission of compact starburst galaxies originates in non-self-gravitating gas clouds. The effect of HCN infrared pumping is small but measurable (10-20%). The gas velocity dispersion varies significantly with the Toomre Q parameter. The Q = 1.5 model yields high-velocity dispersions (vdisp 10 km s-1) consistent with available observations of high-z star-forming galaxies and ULIRGs. However, we note that these high-velocity dispersions are not mandatory for starburst galaxies. The integrated Kennicutt-Schmidt law has a slope of approximately 1 for the local spirals, ULIRGs, and smm-galaxies, whereas the slope is 1.7 for high-z star-forming galaxies. The model shows Kennicutt-Schmidt laws with respect to the molecular gas surface density with slopes of approximately 1.5 for local spiral galaxies, high-z star-forming galaxies. The relation steepens for compact starburst galaxies. The model star-formation rate per unit area is, as observed, proportional to the molecular gas surface density divided by the dynamical timescale. Our relatively simple analytic model together with the recipes for the molecular line emission appears to capture the essential physics of galactic clumpy gas disks. © ESO, 2017.","Galaxies: ISM","Analytical models; Density of gases; Dispersions; Gas emissions; Gases; Luminance; Molecules; Spectroscopy; Stars; Uncertainty analysis; Velocity; Energy distributions; Galaxies: ISM; Interstellar mediums; Spectral energy distribution; Star formation rates; Star forming galaxy; Submillimeter galaxies; Ultraluminous infrared galaxies; Galaxies"

Before organizing teacher training (material, time frame), a survey about teacher's need has to be done. Science teacher's perception about science learning in the classroom, the most difficult learning model, difficulties of lesson plan would be a good input for teacher training program. This survey conducted in June 2016. About 23 science teacher filled in the questionnaire. The core of questions are training participation, the most difficult science subject matter, the most difficult learning model, the difficulties of making lesson plan, knowledge of integrated science and problem based learning. Mostly, experienced teacher participated training once a year. Science training is very important to enhance professional competency and to improve the way of teaching. The difficulties of subject matter depend on teacher's education background. The physics subject matter in class VIII and IX are difficult to teach for most respondent because of many formulas and abstract. Respondents found difficulties in making lesson plan, in term of choosing the right learning model for some subject matter. Based on the result, inquiry, cooperative, practice are frequently used in science class. Integrated science is understood as a mix between Biology, Physics and Chemistry concepts. On the other hand, respondents argue that problem based learning was difficult especially in finding contextual problem. All the questionnaire result can be used as an input for teacher training program in order to enhanced teacher's competency.

A ""quasi-monochrome-color"" Lévy noise, i.e., the first-order derivative variable of a linear second-order differential equation subjected to a symmetric α-stable white Lévy noise, also called the harmonic velocity Lévy noise, is proposed. Note that the time-integral of the noise Green function of this kind is equal to zero. This leads to the existence of underlying negative time correlation and implies that a step in one direction is likely followed by a step in the other direction. By using the noise of this kind as a driving source, we discuss the competition between long flights and underlying negative correlations in the metastable dynamics. The quite rich behaviors in the parameter space including an optimum α for the stationary escape rate have been found. Remarkably, slow diffusion does not decrease the stationary rate while a negative correlation increases net escape. An approximate expression for the Lévy-Kramers rate is obtained to support the numerically observed dependencies. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Physical chemistry; Physics; Approximate expressions; First order derivatives; Harmonic velocity; Negative correlation; Noise distribution; Parameter spaces; Second-order differential equation; Time correlations; Differential equations"

In FFHER, shield blocks provide nuclear shielding and thermal shielding for internal and external blanket components. The hybrid of fusion core and fission blanket makes the spectra rather complex. Therefore, it is necessary to make detail shielding design and carry out radiation analysis according to the blanket structure and material property. In this study, a shielding design of combining several different material shield blocks has been proposed. The shielding analysis is performed by Monte Carlo (MC) method. For the radiation deep-penetration problem, the flux and statistical relative error of forward MC estimate are applied to get an optimal weight window for global variance reduction (GVR). The spatial distribution of neutron and gamma flux have been assessed along the shield block depth. Power deposited and dose rate distributions have also been simulated and analysed.

Toward this end, embedding electronic-spin-based qubits within the framework of a crystalline porous material is a promising approach to create precise arrays of qubits. Realizing porous hosts for qubits would also impact the emerging field of quantum sensing, whereby porosity would enable analytes to infuse into a sensor matrix. However, building viable qubits into a porous material is an appreciable challenge because of the extreme sensitivity of qubits to local magnetic noise. To insulate these frameworks from ambient magnetic signals, we borrowed from atomic physics the idea to exploit clock transitions at avoided level crossings. Here, sensitivity to magnetic noise is inherently limited by the flat slope of the so-called clock transition. More specifically, we created an array of clocklike qubits within a metal-organic framework by combining coordination chemistry considerations with the fundamental concept of atomic clock transitions. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies verify a clocklike transition for the hosted cobalt(II) spins in the framework [(TCPP)Co0.07Zn0.93]3[Zr6O4(OH)4(H2O)6]2, the first demonstration in any porous material.

As ice surfaces-particularly the two prism faces-come under greater scrutiny, it is increasingly important to connect the macroscopic faces with the molecular-level structure. The microscopic structure of the ubiquitous ice Ih crystal is well-known. It consists of stacked layers of chair-form hexagonal rings referred to as molecular hexagons. Crystallographic unit cells can be assembled into a regular right hexagonal prism. The bases are labeled crystallographic hexagons. The two hexagons are rotated 30° with respect to each other. The linkage between the familiar macroscopic shape of hexagonal snowflakes and either hexagon is not obvious per se. This report presents experimental data directly connecting the macroscopic shape of ice crystals and the microscopic hexagons. Large ice single crystals were used to fabricate samples with the basal, primary prism, or secondary prism faces exposed at the surface. In each case, the same sample was used to capture both a macroscopic etch pit image and an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) orientation density function (ODF) plot. Direct comparison of the etch pit image and the ODF plot compellingly connects the macroscopic etch pit hexagonal profile to the crystallographic hexagon. The most stable face at the ice- water interface is the smallest area face at the ice-vapor interface. A model based on the molecular structure of the prism faces accounts for this switch.","EBSD; Etching; Ice; Molecular structure; Statistical model",

The urea sensitivity of the hydrogel is usually characterized by the states of ionization and denaturation of the immobilized urease, as such the model includes the effect of the fixed charge groups and temperature coupled with pH on the activity of the urease. Therefore, a novel rate of reaction equation is proposed to characterize the hydrolysis of urea that accounts for both the ionization and denaturation states of the urease subject to the environmental conditions. After examination with the published experimental data, it is thus confirmed that the model can characterize well the responsive behavior of the urea-sensitive hydrogel subject to the urea stimulus, including the distribution patterns of the electrical potential and pH of the hydrogel. The results point to an innovative means for generating electrical power via the enzyme-induced pH and electrical potential gradients, when the hydrogel comes in contact with the urea-rich solution, such as human urine. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bioelectrochemistry; Multiphysics model; Urea-sensitive hydrogel; Urease","Biochemistry; Electrophysiology; Hydrogels; Ionization; Urea; Bioelectrochemistry; Distribution patterns; Electrical potential; Electromechanical models; Environmental conditions; Multi-physics modeling; Numerical characterization; Urease; Metabolism; urea; urease; hydrogel; immobilized enzyme; urea; Article; biosensor; chemical analysis; chemical parameters; chemical phenomena; chemical reaction; electric potential; electrical potential parameters; energy yield; environmental factor; enzyme activity; enzyme denaturation; enzyme immobilization; hydrogel; hydrolysis; ionization; pH; physical chemistry; statistical model; temperature; bioenergy; biological model; chemistry; electricity; genetic procedures; human; hydrogel; protein denaturation; thermodynamics; urine; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Biosensing Techniques; Electricity; Enzymes, Immobilized; Humans; Hydrogel; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrolysis; Models, Biological; Protein Denaturation; Thermodynamics; Urea; Urease"

Inspired by the liquid repellency widely shown in nature, our approach enables to easily mimic the interplay between the chemistry and physics by microtexturing low surface tension PFPEs. To this end, UV-curable resins suitable for SL-processing were formulated by blending multifunctional (meth-)acrylates PFPEs oligomers with photoinitiator and visible dyes whose content was tuned to tailor resin SL sensitivities. Photocalorimetric studies were also performed to investigate the curing behavior of the different formulations upon SL light exposure. Being the first example of stereolithography applied to PFPEs, stereolithographic processability of new developed PFPEs photopolymer was compared with a standard photoresist taken as benchmark (DL260®). Optimized formulations were characterized by reduced laser penetration depth (&lt;75 μm) and small critical energies thus enabling for fast printing of micrometric structures. Arrays of cylindrical pillars (85 μm diameter, 400 μm height) characterized by varied pillars spacing (200 ÷ 350 μm) were rapidly printed with high fidelity as attested by SEM examination. Contact angle measurements in static and dynamic conditions were performed to investigate the surface properties of textured samples using water and oil as the probing liquids. PFPEs liquid repellent performances were compared with those from DL260® textured surfaces arrayed by SL. High water contact angles coupled with low hysteresis asserted that high hydrophobic surfaces were successfully obtained and best-performing textured surfaces were also characterized by high oil repellency. Finally, this study demonstrated that omniphobic surfaces can be easily realized via a single-step, cost-effective, and time-saving process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Omniphobic; Perfluoropolyether; Polymer; Stereolithography; UV-curing","3D printers; Blending; Contact angle; Cost effectiveness; Hydrophobicity; Liquids; Photoresists; Polymers; Printing; Resins; Stereolithography; Surface chemistry; 3-D printing; Hydrophobic surfaces; Micrometric structures; Omniphobic; Perfluoropolyethers; Static and dynamic conditions; Straight-forward method; UV-curing; Curing"

Chakraborty and D. A. Mazziotti, Phys. Rev. A 91, 010101(R) (2015)]. In this paper, we examine the geometric picture of quantum noise for the seven-chromophore Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. Noise expands the feasible set of orbital occupation trajectories to the target state through the violation of the pure-state N-representability conditions on the 1-RDM, known as the generalized Pauli constraints. While the generalized Pauli constraints are not explicitly known for seven-electron systems, we are able to treat a seven-exciton model of the FMO complex through the use of generalized Pauli constraints for p qubits which are known for arbitrary p. In the model, we find that while dephasing noise alone produces a trajectory of ensemble states that neither expands the set of 1-RDMs nor reaches the reaction center, the inclusion of both dephasing and dissipation expands the set of 1-RDMs and exhibits an efficient energy transfer to the reaction center. The degree to which the noise expands the set of 1-RDMs, violating the generalized Pauli constraints, is quantified by the distance of the 1-RDM outside its pure set to the distance of the 1-RDM inside its ensemble set. The geometric picture of energy transfer has applications to general quantum systems in chemistry and physics. © 2017 Author(s).",,

The calculations are performed within the block Born-Oppenheimer approximation where excited state VA2Π1/2(R), VA2Π3/2(R), and VB2Σ1/2(R) adiabatic potential energy surfaces are used together with a Hund's case (c) basis to construct a 6 × 6 diabatic representation of the electronic Hamiltonian. Matrix elements of the angular kinetic energy of the nuclei incorporate Coriolis coupling and, together with the diabatic representation of the electronic Hamiltonian, yield a 6 × 6 effective potential energy matrix. This matrix is diagonal in the asymptotic limit of large internuclear separation with eigenvalues that correlate to the 2Pj alkali atomic energy levels. Scattering matrix elements are computed using the CPM by preparing reactant and product wave packets on the effective potential energy surfaces that correspond to the excited 2Pj alkali states of interest. The reactant wave packet is then propagated forward in time using the split operator method together with a unitary transformation between the adiabatic and diabatic representations. The Fourier transformation of the correlation function between the evolving reactant wave packet and stationary product wave packet yields state-to-state scattering matrix elements as a function of energy for a particular choice of total angular momentum J. Calculations are performed for energies that range from 0.0 to 0.01 hartree and values of J that start with a minimum of J = 0.5 for all M + Ng pairs up to a maximum that ranges from J = 450.5 for KAr to J = 100.5 for CsAr.

Despite substantial theoretical progress, direct experimental measurement of the π-π electronic coupling energy parameter t has remained an old challenge due to molecular structural variability and the large number of parameters that affect the charge transport. Here, we propose a study of π-π interactions from electrochemical and current measurements on a large array of ferrocene-thiolated gold nanocrystals. We confirm the theoretical prediction that t can be assessed from a statistical analysis of current histograms. The extracted value of t ≈35 meV is in the expected range based on our density functional theory analysis. Furthermore, the t distribution is not necessarily Gaussian and could be used as an ultrasensitive technique to assess intermolecular distance fluctuation at the subangström level.

As a general property of molecules, phosphorescence represents a cornerstone problem of chemical physics due to the spin prohibition of the underlying triplet-singlet emission and because its analysis embraces a deep knowledge of electronic molecular structure. Phosphorescence is the simplest physical process which provides an example of spin-forbidden transformation with a characteristic spin selectivity and magnetic field dependence, being the model also for more complicated chemical reactions and for spin catalysis applications. The bridging of the spin prohibition in phosphorescence is commonly analyzed by perturbation theory, which considers the intensity borrowing from spin-allowed electronic transitions. In this review, we highlight the basic theoretical principles and computational aspects for the estimation of various phosphorescence parameters, like intensity, radiative rate constant, lifetime, polarization, zero-field splitting, and spin sublevel population. Qualitative aspects of the phosphorescence phenomenon are discussed in terms of concepts like structure-activity relationships, donor-acceptor interactions, vibronic activity, and the role of spin-orbit coupling under charge-transfer perturbations. We illustrate the theory and principles of computational phosphorescence by highlighting studies of classical examples like molecular nitrogen and oxygen, benzene, naphthalene and their azaderivatives, porphyrins, as well as by reviewing current research on systems like electrophosphorescent transition metal complexes, nucleobases, and amino acids. We furthermore discuss modern studies of phosphorescence that cover topics of applied relevance, like the design of novel photofunctional materials for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), photovoltaic cells, chemical sensors, and bioimaging. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Benzene refining; Charge transfer; Chemical analysis; Computation theory; Law enforcement; Light emission; Light emitting diodes; Metal complexes; Molecular oxygen; Naphthalene; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED); Perturbation techniques; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photovoltaic cells; Rate constants; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Computational aspects; Donor-acceptor interaction; Magnetic field dependences; Molecular triplet state; Organic light emitting diodes(OLEDs); Photofunctional materials; Radiative rate constants; Structure activity relationships; Phosphorescence; inorganic compound; organic compound; chemistry; computer simulation; human; luminescence; Computer Simulation; Humans; Inorganic Chemicals; Luminescence; Luminescent Measurements; Organic Chemicals"

Gd+ reacts with O2 in an exothermic and barrierless reaction to form GdO+ and O. GdO2+ is also formed in this reaction, but this product ion is formed in a sequential reaction, as verified by pressure dependent measurements and comparison with the results for the reaction of GdO+ with O2. The CID experiments of GdO2+ indicate the presence of two GdO2+ precursor ion populations, assigned to a weakly bound oxygen molecule adduct (Gd+-O2) and an inserted cyclic Gd+ dioxide species (O-Gd+-O). Analysis of the resulting product ion cross sections yields bond dissociation energies (BDEs, D0) for Gd+-O2 and OGd+-O, where the latter BDE is also independently measured in an exchange reaction between GdO+ and O2. The CID experiments also provide the energy of the barrier for the rearrangement of the Gd+-O2 adduct to the inserted O-Gd+-O structure (as identified by loss of a single oxygen atom). The thermochemistry measured here yields D0(OGd+-O) = 2.86 ± 0.08 eV, D0(Gd+-O2) = 0.75 ± 0.11 eV, and a barrier height relative to Gd+-O2 of 0.31 ± 0.07 eV. These data are sufficient to characterize in some detail the potential energy surface of the Gd+ reaction with O2 entirely from experiment.

For this, we calculate the exact time-dependent non-equilibrium Green’s function (TD-NEGF) current along a model two-site molecular junction, in which the site energies are subject to correlated noise, and contrast it with that obtained from the Landauer approach. The ability of the steady-state approximation to capture the TD-NEGF behavior at each instant of time is quantified via the same-time correlation function of the currents obtained from the two methods, while their global agreement is quantified by examining differences in the average currents. The Landauer steady-state approach is found to be a useful approximation when (i) the fluctuations do not disrupt the degree of delocalization of the molecular eigenstates responsible for transport and (ii) the characteristic time for charge exchange between the molecule and leads is fast with respect to the molecular correlation time. For resonant transport, when these conditions are satisfied, the Landauer approach is found to accurately describe the current, both on average and at each instant of time. For non-resonant transport, we find that while the steady-state approach fails to capture the time-dependent transport at each instant of time, it still provides a good approximation to the average currents. These criteria can be employed to adopt effective modeling strategies for transport through molecular junctions in interaction with a fluctuating environment, as is necessary to describe experiments. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Physical chemistry; Physics; Characteristic time; Electronic current; Molecular correlations; Molecular junction; Steady state approximation; Time correlation functions; Time-dependent currents; Time-dependent transport; Charge transfer"

The potential energy surface (PES), calculated using a density functional theory method (DFT) and refined with MP2 single-point energy calculations, based on B3LYP geometries, was evaluated. Twelve intramolecular hydrogen bond patterns were identified for 103 in vacuo conformers. The most stable subset of these structures was found to have cooperative NH ⋯ OH ⋯ O[dbnd]C(O) motifs and six minima of importance that lie within 1.2 kcal/mol of each other.

Additionally, the conventional OH ⋯ O[dbnd]C(N) hydrogen bond, which is represented by almost one third of the located minima, donates a number of stable conformers. However, the PES of the conformationally flexible model is highly dependent on the polarity of the environment.

This trend has to do, in part, with the coming post-Moore era, and functional oxide electronics could be regarded as a viable alternative for the current semiconductor electronics. Furthermore, the interface of transition metal oxides is exposing many new emergent phenomena and is increasingly becoming a playground for testing new ideas in condensed matter physics. To achieve high quality epitaxial thin films and heterostructures of transition metal oxides with atomically controlled interfaces, one critical requirement is the use of atomically flat single terminated oxide substrates since the atomic arrangements and the reaction chemistry of the topmost surface layer of substrates determine the growth and consequent properties of the overlying films. Achieving the atomically flat and chemically single terminated surface state of commercially available substrates, however, requires judicious efforts because the surface of as-received substrates is of chemically mixed nature and also often polar. In this review, we summarize the surface treatment procedures to accomplish atomically flat surfaces with single terminating layer for various metal oxide substrates. We particularly focus on the substrates with lattice constant ranging from 4.00 Å to 3.70 Å, as the lattice constant of most perovskite materials falls into this range. For materials outside the range, one can utilize the substrates to induce compressive or tensile strain on the films and explore new states not available in bulk. The substrates covered in this review, which have been chosen with commercial availability and, most importantly, experimental practicality as a criterion, are KTaO3, REScO3 (RE = Rare-earth elements), SrTiO3, La0.18Sr0.82Al0.59Ta0.41O3 (LSAT), NdGaO3, LaAlO3, SrLaAlO4, and YAlO3. Analyzing all the established procedures, we conclude that atomically flat surfaces with selective A- or B-site single termination would be obtained for most commercially available oxide substrates. We further note that this topmost surface layer selectivity would provide an additional degree of freedom in searching for unforeseen emergent phenomena and functional applications in epitaxial oxide thin films and heterostructures with atomically controlled interfaces. © 2017","Atomic flatness; Atomically controlled thin films; Chemical homogeneity; Single crystal substrates; Surface treatment; Transition metal oxides","Condensed matter physics; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Epitaxial growth; Films; Heterojunctions; Interfaces (materials); Lattice constants; Metal testing; Metallic compounds; Metals; Oxide films; Quality control; Single crystals; Strontium; Surface treatment; Tensile strain; Thin films; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Atomic flatness; Chemical homogeneity; High quality epitaxial thin films; Layer-by-layer fabrication; Semiconductor electronics; Single crystal substrates; Technological applications; Transition-metal oxides; Substrates"

However, these tests are exhaustive, time-consuming, and expensive, and the underlying physics of the alteration process from a surface-chemistry point of view is often limited and/or unexplained. Contact-angle measurement is a quicker and more-feasible screening tool to assess the emerging wettability modifiers. It also provides visual data on the mechanics of the wettability-alteration process. This paper focuses on contact-angle measurements as a means to evaluate the wettability alteration on mineral plates and porous-rock samples. Imidazolium ionic liquids were tested at different concentrations. To study the effect of pH on the wettability, sodium chloride and sodium borate were used at different concentrations. The composition of divalent ions was varied because of their possible use with low-/high-salinity water as wettability-alteration agents. Unmodified and surface-modified silica, zirconium, and alumina nanoparticles were also tested. Contact-angle measurements were performed initially on mica, marble, and calcite plates. Experiments were repeated on polished surfaces of Berea sandstone, Indiana limestone, and cleaned Grosmont carbonate cores. Oils (pure and solvent-mixed crude oils) with different viscosities and densities were used to test the effect of oil type on the process. The images were obtained by an single-lens reflex (SLR) camera at different temperatures ranging from 25 to 80°C. By testing with different concentrations, the optimum chemicals were found for different mineral-plate/porous-rock systems. Then, the results were cross checked with the imbibition tests performed on the same samples to validate the contact-angle-measurement observations. Thermal-stability tests were also performed in case of their use during or after a thermal method. For the thermal-stability tests, contact-angle experiments were conducted in a high-pressure and high-temperature (up to 200°C) cell. It was shown that certain ionic liquids and nanofluids are stable at high temperatures and can be efficiently used at low concentrations.

Besides the thermal noise, frequencydependent finite noise emerges, signaling the spin current across the tunneling barrier.

The hydrophobic, porous multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) network was suitable for gas permeation, and the response of the capacitive humidity sensors was faster than that of a device with a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) top electrode. The newly developed measurement system consisting of a small measurement chamber, a computer-controlled high-speed solenoid valve, and a mass-flow controller enabled us to vary the ambient relative humidity within 0.1 s. A comparative study of the devices consisting of a 1.1-μm-thick partially fluorinated polyimide dielectric layer and an MWCNT or SWCNT top electrode revealed that the rise time (humidification process) of the device with MWCNTs (0.49 s) in the transient measurement was almost 3 times shorter than that with SWCNTs (1.48 s) owing to the hydrophobic surface of the MWCNTs. A much larger difference was observed during the drying process (recovery time) probably owing to the hydrophilic parts of the SWCNT surface. It was revealed that the response time was almost proportional to the square of the thickness of the polyimide dielectric layer, d, and the sensitivity was inversely proportional to d. The rise time decreased to 0.15 s and a sensitivity per unit area of 12.1 pF %RH-1 cm-2 was obtained in a device with 0.6-μm-thick polyimide and MWCNT top electrodes.

The ability to use asymmetry to operate molecular-level machines or macroscopically functional devices, or to give novel properties to materials, may address key challenges at the heart of the physical sciences. However, how chirality at one length scale can be translated to asymmetry at a different scale is largely not well understood. In this Review, we discuss systems where chiral information is translated across length scales and through space. A variety of synthetic systems involve the transmission of chiral information between the molecular-, meso- and macroscales. We show how fundamental stereochemical principles may be used to design and understand nanoscale chiral phenomena and highlight important recent advances relevant to nanotechnology. The survey reveals that while the study of stereochemistry on the nanoscale is a rich and dynamic area, our understanding of how to control and harness it and dial-up specific properties is still in its infancy. The long-term goal of controlling nanoscale chirality promises to be an exciting journey, revealing insight into biological mechanisms and providing new technologies based on dynamic physical properties. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

In general, the results from the pre-and-post surveys revealed that the preservice teachers’ interdisciplinary knowledge of using science-themed activities as instructional approaches for teaching mathematics had remarkable changes across all four science content areas including physics, chemistry, biology, and environmental and space science. This study provided additional empirical evidence on how contextualized mathematics educational activities, in the current case using the association between science and mathematics, can be used as effective teacher education resources for developing teachers’ capacity for designing mathematics lessons. © 2016, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Interdisciplinary curriculum; Mathematics education; Mathematics–science integration; Teacher education",

Actually it can be widely applied in various fields, such as physics, nano-materials, biology, chemistry, etc. With the increasingly extensive application of Scanning Tunnel Microscope, it is more important to be able to obtain the fine and affordable Scanning Tunnel Microscope needle tip. In this paper, control circuit of the needle tip has been prepared and made by making use of electrochemical corrosion method. The circuit design covers a wide range of content, like direct current (DC) corrosion and alternating current (AC) corrosion. Firstly, the DC circuit was designed to convert to AC circuit, and this process was based on the comparator. Then the next step was to carry out the simulation experiment of computer. During the experiment, the phenomenon of corrosion occurred gradually. The preset reference voltage was less than the preset actual voltage, which realized the inversion and the alternating current corrosion of comparator. Due to this, the preset function can be achieved. Through the circuit design and computer simulation experiment, the control circuit designed in this paper was proved to be able to prepare and made the ideal tungsten needle tip of the Scanning Tunnel Microscope.","Alternating current corrosion; Direct current corrosion; Electrochemical corrosion method; Scanning tunnel microscope","Comparator circuits; Comparators (optical); Corrosion; Electric impedance measurement; Electrochemical corrosion; Integrated circuit manufacture; Microscopes; Needles; Scanning; Timing circuits; Alternating current; Alternating current corrosion; Computer simulation experiment; Control circuits; Direct current; Reference voltages; Research achievements; Scientific researches; Tunnels"

The infrared ro-vibrational emission lines from organic molecules in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks are unique probes of the physical and chemical structure of planet-forming regions and the processes that shape them. These observed lines are mostly interpreted with local thermal equilibrium (LTE) slab models at a single temperature. Aims. We aim to study the non-LTE excitation effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) in a full disk model to evaluate: (i) what the emitting regions of the different CO2 ro-vibrational bands are; (ii) how the CO2 abundance can be best traced using CO2 ro-vibrational lines using future JWST data and; (iii) what the excitation and abundances tell us about the inner disk physics and chemistry. CO2 is a major ice component and its abundance can potentially test models with migrating icy pebbles across the iceline. Methods. A full non-LTE CO2 excitation model has been built starting from experimental and theoretical molecular data. The characteristics of the model are tested using non-LTE slab models. Subsequently the CO2 line formation was modelled using a two-dimensional disk model representative of T Tauri disks where CO2 is detected in the mid-infrared by the Spitzer Space Telescope. Results. The CO2 gas that emits in the 15 μm and 4.5 μm regions of the spectrum is not in LTE and arises in the upper layers of disks, pumped by infrared radiation. The v2 15 μm feature is dominated by optically thick emission for most of the models that fit the observations and increases linearly with source luminosity. Its narrowness compared with that of other molecules stems from a combination of the low rotational excitation temperature (~ 250 K) and the inherently narrower feature for CO2. The inferred CO2 abundances derived for observed disks range from 3 × 10-9 to 1 × 10-7 with respect to total gas density for typical gas/dust ratios of 1000, similar to earlier LTE disk estimates. Line-to-continuum ratios are low, in the order of a few percent, stressing the need for high signal-to-noise (S/N &gt; 300) observations for individual line detections. Conclusions. The inferred CO2 abundances are much lower than those found in interstellar ices (~ 10-5), indicating a reset of the chemistry by high temperature reactions in the inner disk. JWST-MIRI with its higher spectral resolving power will allow a much more accurate retrieval of abundances from individual P- and R-branch lines, together with the 13CO2Q-branch at 15 μm. The 13CO2Q-branch is particularly sensitive to possible enhancements of CO2 due to sublimation of migrating icy pebbles at the iceline(s). Prospects for JWST-NIRSpec are discussed as well. © ESO, 2017.","Astrochemistry; Line: formation; Molecular processes; Protoplanetary disks; Radiative transfer","Carbon; Density of gases; Infrared radiation; Molecules; Radiative transfer; Signal to noise ratio; Space telescopes; Astrochemistry; High-temperature reaction; Line: formation; Local thermal equilibrium; Molecular process; Protoplanetary disks; Spectral resolving power; Spitzer space telescope; Carbon dioxide"

However, strong localized crustal magnetism at Mars can deflect energetic charged particles and reduce precipitation. In order to quantify these effects, we have developed a model of proton transport and energy deposition in spatially varying magnetic fields, called Atmospheric Scattering of Protons and Energetic Neutrals. We benchmark the model's particle tracing algorithm, collisional physics, and heating rates, comparing against previously published work in the latter two cases. We find that energetic nonrelativistic protons precipitating in proximity to a crustal field anomaly will primarily deposit energy at either their stopping altitude or magnetic reflection altitude. We compared atmospheric ionization in the presence and absence of crustal magnetic fields at 50°S and 182°E during the peak flux of the 29 October 2003 “Halloween storm” SEP event. The presence of crustal magnetic fields reduced total ionization by ~30% but caused ionization to occur over a wider geographic area. ©2017. American Geophysical Union.

As device features shrink to atomic dimensions, the plasma etching processes used to define these devices must resolve these scales. By separating etching processes into cycles of multiple, self-limited steps, different physics processes which are closely coupled in traditional plasma etching can be largely decoupled and separately optimized. This technique, atomic layer etching (ALE), can ideally remove uniform layers of material with consistent thickness in each cycle. ALE holds the promise of improving uniformity, reducing damage, increasing selectivity, and minimizing aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) rates. The practical implementation of ALE depends on how close to ideal the system can be operated and the tolerance to nonideal conditions. In this paper, results are discussed from a computational investigation of the consequences of nonidealities in the ALE of silicon using Ar/Cl2 plasmas for both two dimensional trenches and three dimensional features. The authors found that ideal ALE requires self-limited processes during all steps of the ALE cycle. Steps that include continuous (non-self-limited) etching reactions reduce the ability of ALE to decouple process parameters. In addition to an etch depth that depends on pulse length per cycle, non-self-limited processes can reintroduce ARDE and produce surface roughening. By controlling subcycle pulse times, these deleterious effects can be minimized, and many of the benefits of ALE can be restored. Even nonideal ALE processes, when properly optimized, still provide benefits over continuous etching with similar chemistries and ion energy distributions. Using fluxes generated by a conventional inductively coupled plasma reactor, an example ALE process is able to clear the corners in a three-dimensional fin based field effect transistor case study with significantly less over-etch than the continuous process. © 2017 American Vacuum Society.",,"Aspect ratio; Atoms; Field effect transistors; Inductively coupled plasma; Microelectronics; Plasma applications; Plasma diagnostics; Plasma etching; Aspect ratio dependent etchings; Computational investigation; Inductively coupled plasma reactor; Ion energy distributions; Microelectronics fabrication; Non-ideal conditions; Plasma etching process; Unprecedented demand; Crystal atomic structure"

The pISep technology enables the development of computer controlled pH gradients on both cationic (CEX) and anionic (AEX) IEX stationary phases over the very wide pH range from 2 to 12. In pISep, titration curves generated by proportional mixing of the acidic and basic pISep working buffers alone, or in the presence of non-buffering solutes such as the neutral salt NaCl (0–1 M), polar organics such as urea (0–8 M) or acetonitrile (0–80 Vol%), can be fitted with high fidelity using high order polynomials which, in turn allows construction of a mathematical manifold %A (% acidic pISep buffer) vs. pH vs. [non-buffering solute], permitting precise computer control of pH and the non-buffering solute concentration allowing formation of dual uncoupled liquid chromatographic (LC) gradients of arbitrary shape (Hirsh and Tsonev, 2012 [1]). The separation of protein isoforms examined in this paper by use of such pH gradients in the presence of urea demonstrates the fractionation power of a true single step two dimensional liquid chromatography which we denote as Stability-Influenced Ion Exchange Chromatography (SIIEX). We present evidence that SIIEX is capable of increasing the resolution of protein isoforms difficult to separate by ordinary pH gradient IEX, and potentially simplifying the development of laboratory and production purification strategies involving on-column simultaneous pH and urea unfolding or refolding of targeted proteins.

However, there is significant variability among studies in mass enhancement, which could be due to differences in fuels, fire conditions, dilution, and/or limitations of laboratory experiments and observations. This study focuses on understanding processes affecting biomass-burning SOA formation in laboratory smog-chamber experiments and in ambient plumes. Vapor wall losses have been demonstrated to be an important factor that can suppress SOA formation in laboratory studies of traditional SOA precursors; however, impacts of vapor wall losses on biomass-burning SOA have not yet been investigated. We use an aerosol-microphysical model that includes representations of volatility and oxidation chemistry to estimate the influence of vapor wall loss on SOA formation observed in the FLAME III smog-chamber studies. Our simulations with base-case assumptions for chemistry and wall loss predict a mean OA mass enhancement (the ratio of final to initial OA mass, corrected for particle-phase wall losses) of 1.8 across all experiments when vapor wall losses are modeled, roughly matching the mean observed enhancement during FLAME III. The mean OA enhancement increases to over 3 when vapor wall losses are turned off, implying that vapor wall losses reduce the apparent SOA formation. We find that this decrease in the apparent SOA formation due to vapor wall losses is robust across the ranges of uncertainties in the key model assumptions for wall-loss and mass-transfer coefficients and chemical mechanisms. We then apply similar assumptions regarding SOA formation chemistry and physics to smoke emitted into the atmosphere. In ambient plumes, the plume dilution rate impacts the organic partitioning between the gas and particle phases, which may impact the potential for SOA to form as well as the rate of SOA formation. We add Gaussian dispersion to our aerosol-microphysical model to estimate how SOA formation may vary under different ambient-plume conditions (e.g., fire size, emission mass flux, atmospheric stability). Smoke from small fires, such as typical prescribed burns, dilutes rapidly, which drives evaporation of organic vapor from the particle phase, leading to more effective SOA formation. Emissions from large fires, such as intense wildfires, dilute slowly, suppressing OA evaporation and subsequent SOA formation in the near field. We also demonstrate that different approaches to the calculation of OA enhancement in ambient plumes can lead to different conclusions regarding SOA formation. OA mass enhancement ratios of around 1 calculated using an inert tracer, such as black carbon or CO, have traditionally been interpreted as exhibiting little or no SOA formation; however, we show that SOA formation may have greatly contributed to the mass in these plumes. In comparison of laboratory and plume results, the possible inconsistency of OA enhancement between them could be in part attributed to the effect of chamber walls and plume dilution. Our results highlight that laboratory and field experiments that focus on the fuel and fire conditions also need to consider the effects of plume dilution or vapor losses to walls. © Author(s) 2017.",,

The primary photochemical reaction of vision, the isomerization of retinal in the protein rhodopsin, is known to be a vibrationally coherent reaction, but the Franck-Condon factors responsible for initiating the process have been difficult to resolve with conventional time-resolved spectroscopies. Here we employ experimental and theoretical 2D photon echo spectroscopy to directly resolve for the first time the Franck-Condon factors that initiate isomerization on the excited potential energy surface and track the reaction dynamics. The spectral dynamics reveal vibrationally coherent isomerization occurring on the fastest possible time scale, that of a single period of the local torsional reaction coordinate. We successfully model this process as coherent wavepacket motion through a conical intersection on a ∼30 fs time scale, confirming the reaction coordinate as a local torsional coordinate with a frequency of ∼570 cm-1. As a result of spectral features being spread out along two frequency coordinates, we unambiguously assign reactant and product states following passage through the conical intersection, which reveal the key vibronic transitions that initiate the vibrationally coherent photochemistry of vision. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Band structure; Chemical reactions; Excited states; Ground state; Isomerization; Isomers; Laser spectroscopy; Molecular physics; Photons; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Surface reactions; Vibrations (mechanical); Conical intersection; Franck-Condon factors; Photon-echo spectroscopy; Reaction coordinates; Spectral dynamics; Time-resolved spectroscopy; Vi-bronic transitions; Wave-packet motion; Photochemical reactions"

The latter is explicitly time dependent and, even though it does not commute with the physical Hamiltonian, it behaves as a conserved quantity of the time-evolving system. We discuss two examples of integrable systems in which the emergent eigenstate solution can be applied for an extensive (in system size) time: transport in one-dimensional lattices with initial particle (or spin) imbalance and sudden expansion of quantum gases in optical lattices. We focus on noninteracting spinless fermions, hard-core bosons, and the Heisenberg model.We show that current-carrying states can be ground states of emergent local Hamiltonians, and that they can exhibit a quasimomentum distribution function that is peaked at nonzero (and tunable) quasimomentum.

As one of the typical III-VI semiconductors, InSe has attracted much attention due to its outstanding electrical transport property, attractive quantum physics characteristics, and dramatic photoresponse when it is reduced to atomic scale. However, scalable synthesis of single phase 2D InSe has not yet been achieved so far, greatly hindering further fundamental studies and device applications. Here, we demonstrate the direct growth of wafer-scale layered InSe nanosheets by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The obtained InSe layers exhibit good uniformity, high crystallinity with macro texture feature, and stoichiometric growth by in situ precise control. The characterization of optical properties indicates that PLD grown InSe nanosheets have a wide range tunable band gap (1.26-2.20 eV) among the large-scale 2D crystals. The device demonstration of field-effect transistor shows the n-type channel feature with high mobility of 10 cm2 V-1 s-1. Upon illumination, InSe-based phototransistors show a broad photoresponse to the wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared. The maximum photoresponsivity attains 27 A/W, plus a response time of 0.5 s for the rise and 1.7 s for the decay, demonstrating the strong and fast photodetection ability.

We demonstrate the possibility of ""multipaths"" in the dynamics of continuously monitored qubit systems, wherein multiple optimal paths travel between the same pre- and postselected states over the same time interval. Optimal paths are expressed as solutions to a Hamiltonian dynamical system. The onset of multipaths may be determined by analyzing the evolution of a Lagrangian manifold in this phase space and is mathematically analogous to the formation of caustics in ray optics or semiclassical physics. Additionally, we develop methods for finding optimal traversal times between states or optimal final states given an initial state and evolution time; both give insight into the measurement dynamics of continuously monitored quantum states. We apply our methods in two systems: a qubit with two noncommuting observables measured simultaneously and a qubit measured in one observable while subject to a Rabi drive.

The label ""soft condensed matter"" emphasizes that the large basic building blocks of these materials produce low elastic moduli that govern a material's ability to withstand deformations. Aside from softness, there are many other properties that are also caused by the large size of the constituent building blocks. Soft matter is dissipative, disordered, far from equilibrium, nonlinear, thermal and entropic, slow, observable, gravity affected, patterned, nonlocal, interfacially elastic, memory forming, and active. This is only a partial list of how matter created from large component particles is distinct from ""hard matter"" composed of constituents at an atomic scale. Issues inherent in soft matter raise problems that are broadly important in diverse areas of science and require multiple modes of attack. For example, far-from-equilibrium behavior is confronted in biology, chemistry, geophysics, astrophysics, and nuclear physics. Similarly, issues dealing with disorder appear broadly throughout many branches of inquiry wherever rugged landscapes are invoked.

This work builds on the previously reported theory that takes into account that (1) these ratios are less prone to systematic error than either the full-physics data products or the proxy CH4 data products; and (2) the resulting CH4 and CO2 fluxes are self-consistent. We show that a posteriori fluxes inferred from the GOSAT data generally outperform the fluxes inferred only from in situ data, as expected. GOSAT CH4 and CO2 fluxes are consistent with global growth rates for CO2 and CH4 reported by NOAA and have a range of independent data including new profile measurements (0-7 km) over the Amazon Basin that were collected specifically to help validate GOSAT over this geographical region. We find that large-scale multi-year annual a posteriori CO2 fluxes inferred from GOSAT data are similar to those inferred from the in situ surface data but with smaller uncertainties, particularly over the tropics. GOSAT data are consistent with smaller peak-to-peak seasonal amplitudes of CO2 than either the a priori or in situ inversion, particularly over the tropics and the southern extratropics. Over the northern extratropics, GOSAT data show larger uptake than the a priori but less than the in situ inversion, resulting in small net emissions over the year. We also find evidence that the carbon balance of tropical South America was perturbed following the droughts of 2010 and 2012 with net annual fluxes not returning to an approximate annual balance until 2013. In contrast, GOSAT data significantly changed the a priori spatial distribution of CH4 emission with a 40% increase over tropical South America and tropical Asia and a smaller decrease over Eurasia and temperate South America. We find no evidence from GOSAT that tropical South American CH4 fluxes were dramatically affected by the two large-scale Amazon droughts. However, we find that GOSAT data are consistent with double seasonal peaks in Amazonian fluxes that are reproduced over the 5 years we studied: a small peak from January to April and a larger peak from June to October, which are likely due to superimposed emissions from different geographical regions. © Author(s) 2017.",,

Here, we show that superconducting circuits can be used to perform an analog simulation of a system of two bosonic modes in regimes ranging from strong to ultrastrong coupling. More importantly, our quantum simulation setup enables us to detect output excitations that are related to the ground-state properties of the bosonic modes.

Recently, these methods have been extended to problems such as light-matter interaction, where the QM sub-system is excited from the ground to the excited states. The MM environment provides a field that changes the potential energy landscape of both the ground and excited states in a distinctly different way.

A popular solution posed by Fliege and Meyer treats nodes as charged particles that are constrained to lie on the surface of a sphere that undergo mutual repulsion. The potential energy contained within the system forms a cost function that is minimized by numerical optimization using simulated annealing followed by Limited memory-BFGS (L-BFGS). In this work the cost function's numerical gradient is replaced with an analytical gradient and it is shown that this is sufficient for a L-BFGS alone to achieve similar results. It is also proposed to limit iterations once the solution has converged beyond a threshold for use cases in mechanical designs with much higher error tolerances. A single-core C implementation on a modern machine shows up to 146 times faster convergence times compared with the Fliege implementation. In the limited precision case, all numbers of nodes under 1600 are calculated in under one minute and under 380 in under a second. © 2017 IEEE.","Spherical distributions; Thomson problem","Charged particles; Cost functions; Microphones; Optimization; Potential energy; Simulated annealing; Analytical gradients; Faster convergence; Limited memory bfgs; Numerical integrations; Numerical optimizations; Spherical distribution; Thomson problem; Uniform distribution; Spheres"

It is ironic that the internuclear distances in crystals that are readily measured depend on the sizes of atoms, but since atoms in crystals can be defined in many different ways, all of them arbitrary and often incompatible, there is no natural way to express atomic size. I propose a simple coherent picture of Atoms-in-Crystals which combines properties selected from three different physically sound definitions of atoms and bonds. The charge density of the free atom that is used to construct the procrystal is represented by a sphere of constant charge density having the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) bonded radius. The sum of these radii is equal to the bond length that correlates with the bond flux (bond valence) in the flux theory of the bond. The use of this model is illustrated by answering the question: How big are atoms in crystals? The QTAIM bonded radii are shown to be simple functions of two properties, the number of quantum shells in the atomic core and the flux of the bond that links neighbouring atoms. Various radii can be defined. The univalent bonded radius measures the intrinsic size of the atom and is the same for all cations in a given row of the periodic table, but the observed bonded radius depends also on the bond flux that reflects the chemical environment. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Atom; Atomic radius; Bond; Bond flux; Bond valence; Procrystal; QTAIM; VSEPR model",

As in the pure rotational and the parallel ν1 bands, the small inversion splitting in this band causes a complete failure of the isolated line approximation. As a result, one has to use formalisms not relying on this approximation. However, due to differences between parallel and perpendicular bands of NH3, the applicability of the formalism used in our previous studies of the ν1 band and other parallel bands must be carefully verified. We have found that, as long as potential models only contain components with K1 = K2 = 0, whose matrix elements require the selection rule Δk = 0, the formalism is applicable for the ν4 band with some minor adjustments. Based on both theoretical considerations and results from numerical calculations, the non-diagonality of the relaxation matrices in all the PP, RP, PQ, RQ, PR, and RR branches is discussed. Theoretically calculated self-broadened half-widths are compared with measurements and the values listed in HITRAN 2012. With respect to line coupling effects, we have compared our calculated intra-doublet off-diagonal elements of the relaxation matrix with reliable measurements carried out in the PP branch where the spectral environment is favorable. The agreement is rather good since our results do well reproduce the observed k and j dependences of these elements, thus validating our formalism. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Physical chemistry; Physics; Inversion splitting; Inversion symmetry; Line shape parameters; Line-mixing effects; Numerical calculation; Off-diagonal elements; Relaxation matrix; Reliable measurement; Linear algebra"

Reactivity criteria that go beyond the simple requirement of transition state theory (i.e., PR* &gt; 0) are derived in terms of specific initial conditions. Trajectories that exactly fulfill these conditions cross the conventional dividing surface used in transition state theory (i.e., the plane in configuration space passing through a saddle point of the potential energy surface and perpendicular to the reaction coordinate) only once. Furthermore, they are observed to be strikingly similar and to form a tightly packed bundle of perfectly collimated trajectories in the two-dimensional (R, r) configuration space, although their angular motion is highly specific for each one. Particular attention is paid to symmetrical transition states (i.e., either collinear or T-shaped with C2v symmetry) for which decoupling between angular and radial coordinates is observed, as a result of selection rules that reduce to zero Coriolis couplings between modes that belong to different irreducible representations. Liapunov exponents are equal to zero and Hamilton’s characteristic function is planar in that part of configuration space that is visited by reactive trajectories. Detailed consideration is given to the concept of average reactive trajectory, which starts right from the saddle point and which is shown to be free of curvature-induced Coriolis coupling. The reaction path Hamiltonian model, together with a symmetry-based separation of the angular degree of freedom, provides an appropriate framework that leads to the formulation of an effective two-dimensional Hamiltonian. The success of the adiabatic approximation in this model is due to the symmetry of the transition state, not to a separation of time scales. Adjacent trajectories, i.e., those that do not exactly fulfill the reactivity conditions have similar characteristics, but the quality of the approximation is lower. At higher energies, these characteristics persist, but to a lesser degree. Recrossings of the dividing surface then become much more frequent and the phase space volumes of initial conditions that generate recrossing-free trajectories decrease. Altogether, one ends up with an additional illustration of the concept of reactive cylinder (or conduit) in phase space that reactive trajectories must follow. Reactivity is associated with dynamical regularity and dimensionality reduction, whatever the shape of the potential energy surface, no matter how strong its anharmonicity, and whatever the curvature of its reaction path. Both simplifying features persist during the entire reactive process, up to complete separation of fragments. The ergodicity assumption commonly assumed in statistical theories is inappropriate for reactive trajectories. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Hamiltonians; Molecular physics; Phase space methods; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Separation; Wave functions; Adiabatic approximations; Characteristic functions; Dimensionality reduction; Hamiltonian modeling; Irreducible representations; Reactive trajectories; Symmetrical transition; Transition state theories; Trajectories"

The protocol has been adapted from successful studies of small molecules to address the challenges associated with modeling protein–protein interactions. Specifically, we built homology models of the three antibody–gp120 complexes, extended the sampling times for large bulky residues, incorporated the modeling of glycans on the surface of gp120, and utilized continuum solvent-based loop prediction protocols to improve sampling. We present three experimental surface plasmon resonance data sets, in which antibody residues in the antibody/gp120 interface were systematically mutated to alanine. The RMS error in the large set (55 total cases) of FEP tests as compared to these experiments, 0.68 kcal/mol, is near experimental accuracy, and it compares favorably with the results obtained from a simpler, empirical methodology. The correlation coefficient for the combined data set including residues with glycan contacts, R2 = 0.49, should be sufficient to guide the choice of residues for antibody optimization projects, assuming that this level of accuracy can be realized in prospective prediction. More generally, these results are encouraging with regard to the possibility of using an FEP approach to calculate the magnitude of protein–protein binding affinities. © 2016 The Authors","alchemical FEP; binding affinity optimization; computational chemistry; physics-based models; protein structure prediction",

We illustrate advantages of the proposed scheme by means of numerical simulations employing a vibrational wave packet technique applied to x-ray absorption and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra of the water molecule vibrationally excited by a preceding IR field. The promotion of the vibrationally excited molecule to the dissociative 1a1-14a1 and bound 1a1-12b2 core-excited states with qualitatively different shapes of the potential energy surfaces creates nuclear wave packets localized along and between the OH bonds, respectively. The projection of these wave packets on the final vibrational states, governed by selection and propensity rules, results in spatial selectivity of RIXS sensitive to the initial vibrationally excited state, which makes it possible to probe selectively the ground state properties along different modes. In addition, we propose to use RIXS as a tool to study x-ray absorption from a selected vibrational level of the ground state when the spectral resolution is sufficiently high to resolve vibrational overtones. The proposed technique has potential applications for advanced mapping of multidimensional potential energy surfaces of ground and core-excited molecular states, for symmetry-resolved spectroscopy, and for steering chemical reactions. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,"Ground state; Molecular physics; Molecules; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Water absorption; Wave packets; X ray absorption; X ray scattering; Ground state properties; Nuclear wave packet; Probe spectroscopy; Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering; Spatial selectivity; Vibrational wave packets; Vibrationally excited; Vibrationally excited state; Excited states"

Molecular simulation enables the prediction of the effects of mutation on properties such as binding affinity, secondary and tertiary structure, conformational dynamics, and thermal stability. A number of widely differing approaches have been applied to these predictions, including sequence-based algorithms, knowledge-based potential functions, and all-atom molecular mechanics calculations. Free energy perturbation theory, employing all-atom and explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations, is a rigorous physics-based approach for calculating thermodynamic effects of, for example, protein side-chain mutations. Over the past several years, we have initiated an investigation of the ability of our most recent free energy perturbation methodology to model the thermodynamics of protein mutation for two specific problems: protein–protein binding affinities and protein thermal stability.

Predicting the energetic effects of protein mutations can improve our fundamental understanding of structural biology, the molecular basis of diseases, and possible routes to addressing those diseases with biological drugs. Identifying the effect of single amino acid point mutations on the thermodynamic equilibrium between the folded and unfolded states of a protein can pinpoint residues of critical importance that should be avoided in the process of improving other properties (affinity, solubility, viscosity, etc.) and suggest changes at other positions for increasing stability in protein engineering. Multiple computational tools have been developed for in silico predictions of protein stability in recent years, ranging from sequence-based empirical approaches to rigorous physics-based free energy methods. In this work, we show that FEP+, which is a free energy perturbation method based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, can provide accurate thermal stability predictions for a wide range of biologically relevant systems. Significantly, the FEP+ approach, while originally developed for relative binding free energies of small molecules to proteins and not specifically fitted for protein stability calculations, performs well compared to other methods that were fitted specifically to predict protein stability. Here, we present the broadest validation of a rigorous free energy-based approach applied to protein stability reported to date: 700 + single-point mutations spanning 10 different protein targets. Across the entire data set, we correctly classify the mutations as stabilizing or destabilizing in 84% of the cases, and obtain statistically significant predictions as compared with experiment [average error of ~ 1.6 kcal/mol and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.40]. This study demonstrates, for the first time in a large-scale validation, that rigorous free energy calculations can be used to predict changes in protein stability from point mutations without parameterization or system-specific customization, although further improvements should be possible with additional sampling and a better representation of the unfolded state of the protein. Here, we describe the FEP+ method as applied to protein stability calculations, summarize the large-scale retrospective validation results, and discuss limitations of the method, along with future directions for further improvements. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","molecular dynamics; protein engineering; protein folding; protein stability","mutant protein; amino acid substitution; biology; chemistry; genetics; missense mutation; point mutation; protein stability; thermodynamics; Amino Acid Substitution; Computational Biology; Mutant Proteins; Mutation, Missense; Point Mutation; Protein Stability; Thermodynamics"

The specific focus is the hypothesis that the development of eminent creators depends on the intergenerational availability of domain-specific role-models, and thus, generational time series representing weighted counts of creative activity should exhibit positive autocorrelations. Where previous studies tested this hypothesis on Western, Chinese, and Japanese civilizations, the current study examines Islamic intellectual history. The inquiry began with a significant sample of 1,283 eminent thinkers who were active between AH 60 and 1119 (CE 679-1707) and who made major contributions to 17 achievement domains (mathematics-astronomy, physics, chemistry, natural history, medicine, geography, philosophy, mysticism, theology, jurisprudence, traditions, linguistics, scholarship, commentary, translation, history, and biography). These historic figures were aggregated into 53 consecutive 20-year periods and then subjected to generational time-series analysis, including trend, autocorrelational, and factor analyses. Using stationary series, some domains displayed the expected autocorrelations, but many other domains did not. In particular, where the expected clustering appeared for important mystics and for major contributors to the rational sciences, significant contributors to the religious sciences were randomly distributed across time. The latter result led to a discussion of what happens when certain key thinkers are considered foundational; thus, serving as influential role-models across extended periods of time rather than having their principal effect on the immediately succeeding generation. Illustrious theologians and jurisprudents apparently occupied this central role in Islamic intellectual history.

It is found that Rayleigh scattering plays a critical role in the transport properties and quantum statistics of photons. On the one hand, Rayleigh scattering produces the transparency in the optical transmitted field of the nanofiber, accompanied by the change of atomic phase, population, and frequency shift. On the other hand, the interference between two kinds of scattering fields by Rayleigh scattering and dipole transition modifies the photon statistics (second-order autocorrelation function) of output fields, showing a strong wavelength dependence.

Laser-induced air shock from energetic materials (LASEM) is a promising new method for estimating the detonation velocity of novel explosives using milligram amounts of material, while simultaneously investigating their high temperature chemical reactions. LASEM has been applied to 6 new explosives for the first time: TKX-50, MAD−X1, BDNAPM, BTNPM, TKX-55, and DAAF. Emission spectroscopy of the laser excited materials revealed the formation of the high pressure bands of C2 during the ensuing exothermic reactions. The low thermal sensitivity of the materials also led to unusual laser-material interactions, visualized with high-speed video. The estimated detonation velocities for the 6 explosives were compared to predicted values from EXPLO5 and CHEETAH. The LASEM results suggest that TKX-55, BDNAPM, and BTNPM have higher detonation velocities than predicted by the thermochemical codes, while the estimated detonation velocities for MAD−X1 and TKX-50 are slightly lower than those predicted. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Based on the density matrix as well as the electron scattering theory, in this paper, we reveal the relationship between the exact exchange potential and the exchange-induced dephasing time in quantum plasmonics. Our results indicate that the linewidth of the nanoplasmonics is mainly determined by a first-order Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation rather than a second-order (or high-order) interaction. Meanwhile, the exact exchange potential, a long-term problem to use this nonlocal functional in practical system for huge computation, can be calculated from the corresponding simple damping factor with great efficiency. In addition, since the Coulomb screening effect is automatically included, this relation provides a new thought to detect and test how the nonlocal exchange functions are related to the density-dependent screening Coulomb effect, hence the development of the density functional theory in chemistry and condensed matter physics. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate that our model can reveal more quantum phenomena than traditional methods in nanoplasmonics, and these quantum features are consistent with the results obtained from the first principles. © 2017 IEEE.","Coulomb screening effect; exact exchange potential; exchange induced dephasing time; quantum hydrodynamic model; Quantum plasmonics","Computation theory; Condensed matter physics; Coulomb interactions; Electron scattering; Hartree approximation; Ionic conduction; Numerical methods; Plasmons; Coulomb screening; Dephasing time; Exact exchange; Quantum hydrodynamic models; Quantum plasmonics; Density functional theory"

It can be used to solve time-independent or time-dependent linear Schrödinger and Liouville–von Neumann-equations in one or more dimensions. Also coupled equations can be treated, which allows to simulate molecular quantum dynamics beyond the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. Optionally accounting for the interaction with external electric fields within the semiclassical dipole approximation, WavePacket can be used to simulate experiments involving tailored light pulses in photo-induced physics or chemistry. The graphical capabilities allow visualization of quantum dynamics ‘on the fly’, including Wigner phase space representations. Being easy to use and highly versatile, WavePacket is well suited for the teaching of quantum mechanics as well as for research projects in atomic, molecular and optical physics or in physical or theoretical chemistry. The present Part I deals with the description of closed quantum systems in terms of Schrödinger equations. The emphasis is on discrete variable representations for spatial discretization as well as various techniques for temporal discretization. The upcoming Part II will focus on open quantum systems and dimension reduction; it also describes the codes for optimal control of quantum dynamics. The present work introduces the MATLAB version of WavePacket 5.2.1 which is hosted at the Sourceforge platform, where extensive Wiki-documentation as well as worked-out demonstration examples can be found. Program summary Program Title: WavePacket Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/tc5mrhx9sb.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language:MATLAB Nature of problem: Schrödingerś equations are of fundamental importance in non-relativistic quantum mechanics of distinguishable particles. The solutions of the time-independent equation (TISE) are wavefunctions in coordinate space, the absolute squares of which are usually interpreted as probability density. The time-dependent equation (TDSE) describes the dynamics of a quantum system evolving in time. It plays a crucial role for the simulation, understanding, and prediction of modern experiments in atomic, molecular and optical physics where systems are driven by temporally shaped external fields. Solution method: All numerical methods compiled in WavePacket are based on discrete variable representations. Currently implemented are Gauss–Hermite, Gauss–Legendre and FFT-based schemes. The TISE is solved either by direct diagonalization or by propagation in imaginary time. For the TDSE there is a choice between second order differencing, operator splitting and Chebychev polynomial methods. Additional comments including Restrictions and Unusual features: The WAVEPACKET program package is rather easy and intuitive to use, providing visualization of quantum dynamics ‘on the fly’. It is mainly intended for low-dimensional systems, typically not exceeding three to five degrees of freedom. Detailed user guides and reference manuals are available through numerous Wiki pages hosted at the SOURCEFORGE platform where also a large number of well documented demonstration examples can be found. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bound states; Discrete variable representation; Non-adiabatic transitions; Numerical propagation; Quantum dynamics; Schrödinger equation","Atomic physics; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dynamics; Electric fields; MATLAB; Numerical methods; Open source software; Phase space methods; Probability density function; Quantum optics; Relativity; Software packages; Visualization; Wave packets; Bound state; Dinger equation; Discrete variable representation; Non-adiabatic transitions; Quantum dynamics; Quantum theory"

Sr7Mn4O15 is an interesting structural type in its own right, but has been mainly overlooked to date, exhibiting interesting physics related to low dimensional magnetic ordering and dimer interactions, and we show here that the structural type is a likely candidate for exhibiting a multiferroic ground state.

The weights were optimized using the multiple linear regression method by fitting the scoring function to L_rmsd for the bound docking decoys from Benchmark II. The scoring functions were tested on 35 unbound docking cases. The results show that the scoring function RpveScore including all terms performs best. Also RpveScore was compared with the statistical mechanics-based method derived potential ITScore-PR, and the united atom-based statistical potentials QUASI-RNP and DARS-RNP. The success rate of RpveScore is 71.6% for the top 1000 structures and the number of cases where a near-native structure is ranked in top 30 is 25 out of 35 cases. For 32 systems (91.4%), RpveScore can find the binding mode in top 5 that has no lower than 50% native interface residues on protein and nucleotides on RNA. Additionally, it was found that the long-range electrostatic attractive energy plays an important role in distinguishing near-native structures from the incorrect ones. This work can be helpful for the development of protein–RNA docking methods and for the understanding of protein–RNA interactions.

Quantum mechanical calculations appear promising as a means of describing the mechanisms and the product distributions of the photocatalytic degradation reactions of organic pollutants in both gas and aqueous phases. Since quantum mechanical methods utilize the principles of particle physics, their use may be extended to the design of new photocatalysts.

However, whether catchments behave as sources or sinks of soil carbon and nitrogen based on the combined performance of land use change and check-dam construction in sub-catchment systems are still poorly known. To quantitatively assess the effect of land use change and check-dam construction on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen (TSN) stocks, and to explore the dominate factor influencing SOC and TSN sequestration potential, three sub-catchments controlled by check-dams were selected in the small catchment on the loess plateau of China. The SOC and TSN content and soil physic-chemical properties were analyzed under different land use types (farmland, grassland, shrubland, forestland, and check-dam land). Results clearly showed that the conversion from farmland to grassland and forestland induced an increase of SOC and TSN (1.32-fold C and1.36-fold N increase in grassland and 1.24-fold C and1.20-fold N increase in forestland, respectively). Comparing sediments to the corresponding source soil, the average enrichment ratios (ER) for SOC and TSN in sediments trapped behind check-dams were lower than 1 (0.56 ± 0.10 and 0.65 ± 0.12, respectively), and check-dam construction induced a net C and N loss (19.38% and 10.61%, respectively). The amount of SOC and TSN in three sub-catchments showed a significant positive correlation with the controlled watershed area (P < 0.05). High proportion of forestland and years after construction contributed positively to SOC and TSN stocks per unit area in check-dam (P < 0.05), indicating that the controlled watershed area, forestland fraction, and years after construction other than soil erosion were also the dominate influencing factors to affect carbon and nitrogen sequestration potential. The results indicated that, although erosion-induced soils and associated SOC and TSN were redistributed at the landscape scale, land use change and check-dam construction might still cause the catchment to behave as soil C and N sinks within the soil erosion subsystem since the 1999s. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Check-dam systems; Enrichment ratios; Land use change; Soil erosion; Soil organic carbon; Total nitrogen","Catchments; Chemical analysis; Dams; Erosion; Farms; Forestry; Landforms; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Runoff; Sediments; Soil mechanics; Soils; Watersheds; Check dam; Enrichment ratio; Land-use change; Soil erosion; Soil organic carbon; Total nitrogen; Land use; agricultural land; catchment; dam construction; grassland; land use change; organic carbon; physicochemical property; soil carbon; soil chemistry; soil erosion; soil nitrogen; watershed; China; Loess Plateau"

Research on misconceptions can help enhance student learning about semiconductors. Purpose (Hypothesis): This project sought to identify students’ misconceptions about three semiconductor phenomena – diffusion, drift, and excitation – and to determine if prior knowledge, knowledge acquired from watching animated simulations, or both were related to students’ misconceptions. We hypothesized that students would hold misconceptions about those phenomena and that students’ prior knowledge and knowledge acquired from watching animated simulations would be associated with their misconceptions. Design/Method: Forty-one engineering students completed an instrument that asked questions about three semiconductor phenomena after the students had observed the animated simulations. Responses were analyzed and coded using two frameworks: misconception and knowledge use. Results: Misconceptions were prevalent for all three phenomena. Misconceptions were associated with use of incorrect prior knowledge, a combination of correct or incorrect prior knowledge, and the knowledge acquired from watching the animated simulations alone or in combination with correct and incorrect prior knowledge. Misconceptions indicated a lack of understanding of chemistry and physics concepts. Conclusions: Findings indicate that students hold many misconceptions about semiconductor phenomena. These misconceptions were common among our participants. The knowledge acquired from the animated simulations alone or in combination with prior knowledge could reinforce or contribute to misconception formation. Our findings can guide instructors to use or create better simulations to aid student learning. © 2013 ASEE","misconceptions; prior knowledge; semiconductors; simulations","Education; Semiconductor materials; Animated simulation; Educational resource; Knowledge use; misconceptions; Prior knowledge; simulations; Student learning; Students"

The representations mentioned above are obtained in the form of Feynman formulas, i.e., in the form of a limit of multiple integrals as the multiplicity tends to infinity. The term “Feynman formula” was proposed by Smolyanov. Smolyanov’s approach uses Chernoff’s theorems. A simple form of representations thus obtained enables one to use them for numerical modeling the dynamics of the evolution system as a method for the approximation of solutions of equations. The problems considered in this note can be treated using the approach suggested by Remizov (see also the monograph of Smolyanov and Shavgulidze on path integrals).

Markov State Models (MSMs) help to overcome these problems by making experimentally relevant time scales accessible via coarse grained representations that also allow for convenient interpretation. However, standard set-based MSMs exhibit some caveats limiting their approximation quality and statistical significance. One of the main caveats results from the fact that typical MD trajectories repeatedly re-cross the boundary between the sets used to build the MSM which causes statistical bias in estimating the transition probabilities between these sets. In this article, we present a set-free approach to MSM building utilizing smooth overlapping ansatz functions instead of sets and an adaptive refinement approach. This kind of meshless discretization helps to overcome the recrossing problem and yields an adaptive refinement procedure that allows us to improve the quality of the model while exploring state space and inserting new ansatz functions into the MSM. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Physical chemistry; Physics; Adaptive refinement; Approximation quality; Markov State models; Mesh-less discretization; Molecular dynamics simulations; Statistical bias; Statistical significance; Transition probabilities; Molecular dynamics"

Two events have been analysed, and the data combined with electron transport and ion chemistry modelling provide estimates of the energy and energy flux during both the ON and OFF periods of the pulsations. Both the energy and energy flux are found to be reduced during each OFF period compared with the ON period, and the estimates indicate that it is the number flux of foremost higher-energy electrons that is reduced. The energies are found never to drop below a few kilo-electronvolts during the OFF periods for these events. The high-resolution optical data show the occurrence of dips in brightness below the diffuse background level immediately after the ON period has ended. Each dip lasts for about a second, with a reduction in brightness of up to 70ĝ€-% before the intensity increases to a steady background level again. A different kind of variation is also detected in the OFF period emissions during the second event, where a slower decrease in the background diffuse emission is seen with its brightness minimum just before the ON period, for a series of pulsations. Since the dips in the emission level during OFF are dependent on the switching between ON and OFF, this could indicate a common mechanism for the precipitation during the ON and OFF phases. A statistical analysis of brightness rise, fall, and ON times for the pulsations is also performed. It is found that the pulsations are often asymmetric, with either a slower increase of brightness or a slower fall. © 2017 The Author(s).","Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; ionosphere interactions); magnetospheric physics (magnetosphere; particle precipitation)",

We focused on binding between CaM and two specific targets, Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and neurogranin (Ng), as they both regulate CaM-dependent Ca2+ signaling pathways in neurons. It was shown experimentally that Ca2+/CaM (holoCaM) binds to the CaMKII peptide with overwhelmingly higher affinity than Ca2+-free CaM (apoCaM); the binding of CaMKII peptide to CaM in return increases the Ca2+ affinity for CaM. However, this reciprocal relation was not observed in the Ng peptide (Ng13–49), which binds to apoCaM or holoCaM with binding affinities of the same order of magnitude. Unlike the holoCaM-CaMKII peptide, whose structure can be determined by crystallography, the structural description of the apoCaM-Ng13–49 is unknown due to low binding affinity, therefore we computationally generated an ensemble of apoCaM-Ng13–49 structures by matching the changes in the chemical shifts of CaM upon Ng13–49 binding from nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Next, we computed the changes in Ca2+ affinity for CaM with and without binding targets in atomistic models using Jarzynski's equality. We discovered the molecular underpinnings of lowered affinity of Ca2+ for CaM in the presence of Ng13–49 by showing that the N-terminal acidic region of Ng peptide pries open the β-sheet structure between the Ca2+ binding loops particularly at C-domain of CaM, enabling Ca2+ release. In contrast, CaMKII peptide increases Ca2+ affinity for the C-domain of CaM by stabilizing the two Ca2+ binding loops. We speculate that the distinctive structural difference in the bound complexes of apoCaM-Ng13–49 and holoCaM-CaMKII delineates the importance of CaM's progressive mechanism of target binding on its Ca2+ binding affinities. © 2017 Biophysical Society",,"apoprotein; calcium; calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II; calmodulin; neurogranin; peptide fragment; protein binding; amino acid sequence; chemistry; metabolism; molecular model; protein conformation; Amino Acid Sequence; Apoproteins; Calcium; Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2; Calmodulin; Models, Molecular; Neurogranin; Peptide Fragments; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation"

Although much progress has been made in understanding the basic physics of hydrophobically induced evaporation, a comprehensive understanding of the substrate material features (e.g., geometry, chemistry, and mechanical properties) that promote or inhibit such transitions remains lacking. In particular, comparatively little research has explored the relationship between water's phase behavior in hydrophobic confinement and the mechanical properties of the confining material. Here, we report the results of extensive molecular simulations characterizing the rates, free energy barriers, and mechanism of water evaporation when confined between model hydrophobic materials with tunable flexibility. A single-order-of-magnitude reduction in the material's modulus results in up to a nine-orders-ofmagnitude increase in the evaporation rate, with the corresponding characteristic time decreasing from tens of seconds to tens of nanoseconds. Such a modulus reduction results in a 24-orders-of-magnitude decrease in the reverse rate of condensation, with time scales increasing from nanoseconds to tens of millions of years. Free energy calculations provide the barriers to evaporation and confirm our previous theoretical predictions that making the material more flexible stabilizes the confined vapor with respect to liquid. The mechanism of evaporation involves surface bubbles growing/coalescing to form a subcritical gap-spanning tube, which then must grow to cross the barrier.","Elasticity; Evaporation; Hydrophobic effect; Nanoconfinement; Phase transitions",

However, ultrafast electron ejection triggers not only electronic but also nuclear dynamics - leading to electronic decoherence, which is typically neglected on time scales up to tens of femtoseconds. We propose a full quantum-dynamical treatment of nuclear motion in an adiabatic framework, where nuclear wave packets move on adiabatic potential energy surfaces expanded up to second order at the Franck-Condon point. We show that electronic decoherence is caused by the interplay of a large number of nuclear degrees of freedom and by the relative topology of the potential energy surfaces. Application to H2O, paraxylene, and phenylalanine shows that an initially coherent state evolves to an electronically mixed state within just a few femtoseconds. In these examples the fast vibrations involving hydrogen atoms do not affect electronic coherence at short times. Conversely, vibrational modes involving the whole molecular skeleton, which are slow in the ground electronic state, quickly destroy it upon photoionization. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,"Amino acids; Atoms; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electronic states; Ionization; Molecular physics; Photoionization; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Adiabatic potential energy surface; Coherent superpositions; Electronic coherence; Electronic decoherence; Franck-Condon point; Ground electronic state; Molecular skeleton; Nuclear wave packet; Potential energy"

Here we overview and revisit recent advancements, based on stochastic simulations, where the geometry of rigid helical templates with functionalised sticky ends has been designed for self-assembling efficiently and reproducibly into a wide range of three-dimensional closed structures. Notably, these include non trivial topologies of links and knots, including the 819 knot that we had predicted to be highly encodable and that has only recently been obtained experimentally. By appropriately tuning the parameters that define the template shape, we show that, for fixed concentration of templates, the assembly process can be directed towards the formation of specific knotted and linked structures such as the trefoils, pentafoil knots, Hopf and Solomon links.

Applications of interest are accident scenarios relevant to nuclear power plant safety, renewable energy systems involved in hydrogen transport, hydrogen storage, facilities operating with hydrogen, as well as conventional large scale energy systems involving combustible gases. All model development is conducted within the framework of the high-performance scientific computing software GASFLOW-Multi-Physics-Integration (MPI). GASFLOW-MPI is the advanced parallel version of the GASFLOW sequential code with many newly developed and validated models and features. The code provides reliability, robustness and excellent parallel scalability in predicting all-speed flow-fields associated with hydrogen safety, including distribution, turbulent combustion and detonation. In the meanwhile, it has been well verified and validated by many international blind and open benchmarks. The recently developed combustion models in GASFLOW-MPI code are based on the transport equation of a reaction progress variable. The sources consist of turbulence dominated and chemistry kinetics dominated terms. Models have been implemented to compute the turbulent burning velocity for the turbulence controlled combustion rate. One-step and two-step models are included to obtain the chemical kinetics controlled reaction rate. These models, combined with the efficient and verified all-speed solver of the GASFLOW-MPI code, can be used for simulations of deflagration, detonation and the important transition processes like flame acceleration (FA) and deflagration-to-detonation-transition (DDT), without additional need for expert judgment and intervention. It should be noted that the major goal is to develop a reliable and efficient numerical tool for large-scale engineering analysis, instead of resolving the extremely complex physical phenomena and detailed chemistry kinetics on microscopic scales. During the course of this development, new verification and validation studies were completed for phenomena relevant to hydrogen-fueled combustion, such as shock wave capturing, premixed and non-premixed turbulent combustion with convective, conductive and radiation heat losses, detonation of unconfined hydrogen–air mixtures, and confined detonation waves in tubes. Excellent agreements between test data and model predictions support the predictive capabilities of the combustion models in GASFLOW-MPI code. In Part II of the paper, the newly developed CFD methodology has been successfully applied to a first analysis of hydrogen distribution and explosion in the Fukushi Daicchi Unit 1 accident. The major advantage of GASFLOW-MPI code is the all-speed capability of simulating laminar and turbulent distribution processes, slow deflagration, transition to fast hydrogen combustion modes including detonation, within a single scientific software framework without the need of transforming data between different solvers or codes. Since the code can model the detailed heat transfer mechanisms, including convective heat transfer, thermal radiation, steam condensation and heat conduction, the effects of heat losses on hydrogen deflagrations or detonations can also be taken into account. Consequently, the code provides more accurate and reliable mechanical and thermal loads to the confining structures, compared to the overly conservative results from numerical simulations with the adiabatic assumptions. Predictions of flame acceleration mechanisms associated with turbulent flames and flow obstacles, as well as DDT modeling and their comparisons to available data will be presented in future papers. A structural analysis module will be further developed. The ultimate goal is to expand the GASFLOW-MPI code into an integral high-performance multi-physics simulation tool to cover the entire spectrum of phenomena involved in the mechanistic hydrogen safety analysis of large scale industrial facilities. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","CFD modeling; Combustion; GASFLOW-MPI code; Hydrogen safety; Nuclear containment","Accident prevention; Air; Chemical analysis; Codes (symbols); Combustion; Computer programming; Detonation; Digital storage; Dispersion (waves); Explosions; Explosives; Forecasting; Heat conduction; Heat convection; Heat losses; Heat transfer; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Kinetics; Mass transfer; Metadata; Mixtures; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Radiation effects; Reaction kinetics; Renewable energy resources; Safety engineering; Shock waves; Steam condensers; Turbulence; CFD modeling; Computational Fluid Dynamics codes; Deflagration to detonation transition; GASFLOW-MPI code; High performance scientific computing; Hydrogen safety; Nuclear containment; Turbulent burning velocities; Computational fluid dynamics"

Because there is no spin-angle operator, any measurement of spin precession is necessarily indirect, for example, it may be inferred from spin projectors at different times. Such projectors do not commute, and so quantum measurement back-action-the random change in a quantum state due to measurement-necessarily enters the spin measurement record, introducing errors and limiting sensitivity. Here we show that this disturbance in the spin projector can be reduced below N 1/2-the classical limit for N spins-by directing the quantum measurement back-action almost entirely into an unmeasured spin component. This generates a planar squeezed state that, because spins obey non-Heisenberg uncertainty relations, enables simultaneous precise knowledge of spin angle and spin amplitude. We use high-dynamic-range optical quantum non-demolition measurements applied to a precessing magnetic spin ensemble to demonstrate spin tracking with steady-state angular sensitivity 2.9 decibels below the standard quantum limit, simultaneously with amplitude sensitivity 7.0 decibels below the Poissonian variance. The standard quantum limit and Poissonian variance indicate the best possible sensitivity with independent particles. Our method surpasses these limits in non-commuting observables, enabling orders-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity for state-of-the-art sensing and spectroscopy. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

However, the simulation of water radiolysis is highly time consuming, taking hours or even days to be completed by a conventional CPU processor. This time limitation hinders cell-level simulations for a number of research studies. We recently initiated efforts to develop gMicroMC, a GPU-based fast microscopic MC simulation package for water radiolysis. The first step of this project focused on accelerating the simulation of the chemical stage, the most time consuming stage in the entire water radiolysis process. A GPU-friendly parallelization strategy was designed to address the highly correlated many-body simulation problem caused by the mutual competitive chemical reactions between the radiolytic molecules. Two cases were tested, using a 750 keV electron and a 5 MeV proton incident in pure water, respectively. The time-dependent yields of all the radiolytic species during the chemical stage were used to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation. The relative differences between our simulation and the Geant4-DNA simulation were on average 5.3% and 4.4% for the two cases. Our package, executed on an Nvidia Titan black GPU card, successfully completed the chemical stage simulation of the two cases within 599.2 s and 489.0 s. As compared with Geant4-DNA that was executed on an Intel i7-5500U CPU processor and needed 28.6 h and 26.8 h for the two cases using a single CPU core, our package achieved a speed-up factor of 171.1-197.2. © 2017 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","chemical stage; gMicroMC; GPU acceleration; MC simulation; water radiolysis","Bioinformatics; Graphics processing unit; Intelligent systems; Petroleum tar; Polymer films; Radiation chemistry; Radiolysis; Uranium; Chemical stages; gMicroMC; GPU accelerations; MC simulation; Water radiolysis; Monte Carlo methods"

With similar method, a program structure prototype analysis package (SPAP) was developed to remove similar structures in CALYPSO prediction results and extract predicted low energy structures for a separate theoretical structure database. A series of statistics describing the distribution of crystal structure prototypes in the CSPD was compiled to provide an important insight for structure prediction and high-throughput calculations. Illustrative examples of the application of the proposed database are given, including the generation of initial structures for structure prediction and determination of the prototype structure in databases.

Four low-lying electronic states (X1Σ+, C1Π, 3Π and 23Π) of InF have been calculated using the multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) method. The spin-orbit coupling effects are also taken into account in the electronic structure computation at the MRCI level. The highly diagonal Franck-Condon factors for C1Π → X1Σ+ transitions are estimated. The radiative lifetime of the C1Π (v′ = 0) state is about 2.22 ns, which is found to be enough short for rapid laser cooling. Though the cooling wavelength of InF is located in the short-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVC), a frequency quadrupled Ti: sapphire laser (189–235 nm) could be capable of generating laser transition wavelength of InF. Furthermore, the C1Π → X1Σ+ transitions perhaps can be followed by the B3Π1 → X1Σ+ 0+ transitions to attain a lower Doppler temperature. Meanwhile, for achieving quasi-closed transition cycle of InF molecule, we investigate the hyperfine structure of the lowest state X1Σ+.

The longitudinal displacement of two π-stacked molecules against each other is used as model and the methods are benchmarked against SCS-CC2 and SCS-ADC(2). Furthermore a simple character analysis is applied. In the case of the perylene dimer, CAM-B3LYP and ωB97XD provide accurate results. However, while CAM-B3LYP fails for the PBI (perylene bisimide) dimer the performance of ωB97XD is highly dependent on the used monomer geometry due to close-lying diabatic states. A change in geometry changes the character of the excited states even qualitatively. The accuracy of several other long-range corrected functionals (LC-BLYP, LC-ωPBE, ωB97X) and the effect of empirically tuning the range-separation parameter of ωB97XD are also presented for this interesting case. Furthermore, it is shown that the semiempirical method OM2 fails to provide a correct description of the excited states when the orbital overlap plays a significant role. This is attributed to the too contracted basis set. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","dye aggregates; excited states; organic electronics; semiempirical methods; TDDFT","Aggregates; Cams; Computation theory; Density functional theory; Dimers; Molecular physics; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Dye aggregates; Intermolecular motion; Longitudinal displacements; Organic electronics; Semi-empirical methods; Separation parameters; TDDFT; Time dependent density functional theory; Excited states"

The fascinating and unusual properties of this 2D material were indeed recently investigated and exploited in several disciplines including physics, medicine, and chemistry, indicating the extremely versatile and polyedric aspect of this nanomaterial. The utilization of nanomaterials, printed technology, and microfluidics in electroanalysis has resulted in a period that can be called the “Electroanalysis Renaissance” (Escarpa, 2012) in which graphene is without any doubt a forefront nanomaterial. The rise in affordable fabrication processes, along with the great dispersing attitude in a plenty of matrices, have made graphene powerful in large-scale production of electrochemical platforms. Herein, we overview the employment of graphene to customize and/or fabricate printable based (bio)sensors over the past 5 years, including several modification approaches such as drop casting, screen- and inkjet-printing, different strategies of graphene-based sensing, and applications as well.

PHF handles the nondynamic correlation effects by restoring the symmetry of a broken-symmetry single reference wavefunction and moreover enables a black-box treatment of orbital selections. Using HF orbitals instead of PHF orbitals, our approach saves the computational cost for the orbital optimization, avoiding the convergence problem that sometimes emerges in the VAP scheme. We show that PAV-PHF provides geometries comparable to those of the complete active space self-consistent field and VAP-PHF for the tested systems, namely, CH2, O3, and the [Cu2O2]2+ core, where nondynamic correlation is abundant. The proposed approach is useful for large systems mainly dominated by nondynamic correlation to find stable structures in many symmetry-adapted states. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Physical chemistry; Physics; Complete active space self consistent fields; Computational costs; Convergence problems; Correlation effect; Energy gradients; Geometrical optimization; Orbital optimizations; Stable structures; Molecular physics"

This article details a new algorithm and implementation for the incremental expansion of full configuration interaction (FCI), called iFCI. By dividing the problem into n-body interaction terms, accurate correlation energies can be recovered at low n in a highly parallel computation. Additionally, relatively low-cost approximations are possible in iFCI by solving for each incremental energy to within a specified threshold. Herein, systematic tests show that FCI-quality energies can be asymptotically reached for cases where dynamic correlation is dominant as well as where static correlation is vital. To further reduce computational costs and allow iFCI to reach larger systems, a select-CI approach (heat-bath CI) requiring two parameters is incorporated. Finally, iFCI provides the first estimate of FCI energies for hexatriene with a polarized double zeta basis set, which has 32 electrons correlated in 118 orbitals, corresponding to a FCI dimension of over 1038. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Physical chemistry; Physics; Algorithm and implementation; Computational costs; Correlation energy; Dynamic correlation; Electronic correlation; Full configuration interaction; Highly parallels; Interaction term; Quantum chemistry"

We developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to probe specific structure-function relationships in the context of a protein-protein interaction that can be completed within a week of 45 min daily classes or a single 3-4 h lab using accessible reagents and materials (e.g., micropipettes and camera phones). The assay detected the high-affinity interaction between immunoglobulin G (IgG) and an engineered fibronectin domain protein. To demonstrate the impact of small chemical changes on intermolecular interactions, four mutant fibronectin domains were engineered, each with a single amino acid change, to provide a variety of chemical groups in the hypothesized binding site that resulted in a range of affinities for IgG (equilibrium dissociation constants from 1.5-696 nM). The experiment was implemented with two classes of high school chemistry students. Students effectively differentiated between strong and weak protein-protein interactions (median correlation coefficient between observed and expected results = 0.88) and demonstrated keen interest in the assay and concepts. Students were asked to then design and conduct a variation of the ELISA to test their own hypotheses regarding various experiment parameters to great success. Image acquisition for assay colorimetry was identified as a potential area of improvement. We have shown that this experiment is accessible to high school students both fiscally and academically and can be a fun and effective tool to apply their knowledge of intermolecular forces within the context of proteins. We have shown that the experiment could also be implemented in an undergraduate laboratory setting to allow for advanced inquiry into protein-protein interaction quantification and data analysis.

In dimensions higher than one the approach fails due to the pathology of the Dirac δ-potential, making it impossible to reach convergence by gradually increasing the size of the Hilbert space. However, this problem may be cured in a rather simple manner by renormalizing the strength of the contact potential when diagonalizing in a truncated Hilbert space. One hereby relies on the comparison of the CI results to the two-body ground-state energy obtained by the exact solution of the Schrödinger equation for a regularized contact interaction.

To study this problem, we propose two different approaches. The first is a pragmatic approach that assumes Lorentzian-like transmission functions that determine the transmission probability to the island. Using this model, we calculate current versus voltage (IV) curves for increasing resonance level positions of the molecule. We find that shifting the resonance energy of the molecule away from the Fermi energy of the contacts leads to a decreased current at low bias, but as bias increases, this difference decreases and eventually inverses. This is markedly different from IV behavior outside the cotunneling regime. The second approach involves multiple cotunneling where also the molecules are considered to be in the Coulomb blockade regime.

Features are often broad, seemingly unstructured and distributed over more than an order of magnitude. However, the distribution contains information necessary for capturing the full variety of processes relevant in nanoscale transport, and a better understanding of its hierarchical structure is needed to gain deeper insight into the physics and chemistry of single molecule electronics. Here, we describe a novel data analysis approach based on hierarchical clustering to aid in the interpretation of single molecule conductance-displacement histograms. The primary purpose of statistically partitioning transport data is to provide avenues for unbiased hypothesis generation in single molecule break junction experiments by revealing otherwise potentially hidden aspects in the conductance data. Our approach is generalizable to the analysis of a wide variety of other single molecule experiments in molecular electronics, as well as in single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy, force microscopy, and ion-channel conductance measurements. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Fluorescence spectroscopy; Molecules; Stochastic systems; Hier-archical clustering; Hierarchical data structure; Hierarchical structures; Ion channel conductance; Single molecule conductance; Single molecule experiments; Single-molecule electronics; Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy; Data handling"

In general, the measurement of interfacial thermal rectification is based on measuring interfacial thermal resistance (ITR). However, ITRs measured via conventional methods cannot avoid extra thermal resistance asymmetry due to the contact between the sample and the thermometer. In this study, we employed a non-contact infrared thermal imager to monitor the temperature of super-aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) films and obtain the ITRs between the CNT films and copper. The ITRs along the CNT-copper direction and the reverse direction are in the ranges of 2.2-3.6 cm2 K W-1 and 9.6-11.9 cm2 K W-1, respectively. The obvious difference in the ITRs of the two directions shows a significant thermal rectification effect, and the rectifying coefficient ranges between 0.57 and 0.68. The remarkable rectification factor is extremely promising for the manufacture of thermal transistors with a copper/CNT/copper structure and further thermal logic devices.

Using CCSD(T)/CBS PAH isomerization energies, we find that all generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and meta GGA DFT functionals have severe difficulties in describing isomerization energies in PAHs. The poor performance of these functionals is demonstrated by the following root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) obtained for a database of C14H10 and C18H12 isomerization energies. The RMSDs for the GGAs range between 6.0 (BP86-D3) and 23.0 (SOGGA11) and for the meta GGAs they range between 3.5 (MN12-L) and 11.9 (τ-HCTH) kJ mol−1. These functionals (including the dispersion-corrected methods) systematically and significantly underestimate the isomerization energies. A consequence of this behavior is that they all predict that chrysene (rather than triphenylene) is the most stable C18H12 isomer. A general improvement in performance is observed along the rungs of Jacob's Ladder; however, only a handful of functionals from rung four give good performance for PAH isomerization energies. These include functionals with high percentages (40–50%) of exact Hartree–Fock exchange such as the hybrid GGA SOGGA11-X (RMSD = 1.7 kJ mol−1) and the hybrid-meta GGA BMK (RMSD = 1.3 kJ mol−1). Alternatively, the inclusion of lower percentages (20–30%) of exact exchange in conjunction with an empirical dispersion correction results in good performance. For example, the hybrid GGA PBE0-D3 attains an RMSD of 1.5 kJ mol−1, and the hybrid-meta GGAs PW6B95-D3 and B1B95-D3 result in RMSDs below 1 kJ mol−1. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","CCSD(T); Clar's rule; density functional theory; isomerization energies; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; W1 theory","Aromatic compounds; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Aromatization; Density functional theory; Dispersions; Hydrocarbons; Isomerization; Isomers; Ladders; Molecular physics; Phase equilibria; Plants (botany); Quantum chemistry; CCSD; Clar's rule; Dispersion correction; Generalized gradient approximations; Hartree-Fock exchanges; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Root mean square deviations; W1 theory; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons"

Their molecular designs are inspired by natural polymers like proteins and are modularly constructed from molecular nanoparticle building blocks via sequential “click” chemistry. Most important molecular parameters such as topology, composition, and molecular weight can be precisely controlled. Their hierarchical assembly reveals many features reminiscent of both small molecules and proteins yet unusual for conventional synthetic polymers. These features are summarized and compared along with synthetic polymers and proteins. Specifically, examples are given in each category of giant molecules to illustrate the characteristics of their hierarchical assembly across different length, time and energy scales. The idea of “artificial domain” is presented in analogy to the structural domains in proteins. By doing so, we aim to develop a rational and modular approach toward functional materials. The factors that dominate the materials functions are discussed with respect to the precision and dynamics of the assembly.

Among many distinguished disparities between combustion modeling of conventional and MILD ones, turbulent-chemistry interaction modeling is an open field of study. Current knowledge on modeling this combustion regime shows that the eddy dissipation concept (EDC) model could be successfully used for modeling of this combustion regime. In this paper, it has been tried to propose some guidelines to modify the semi-empirical constants of the original EDC model for MILD combustion. In this way a parametric study of the EDC model constants for a nonpremixed MILD burner is done in terms of accuracy of prediction while the responses of the model to its constants are focused on the basis of physical arguments. Burner of Dally et al. (JHC) is modeled using the RANS approach in a 2D axisymmetric computational domain for different oxygen levels and fuel jet Reynolds numbers when a reduced detail chemical mechanism of DRM-22 is used to represent the chemical mechanism. Moreover using a well-stirred–reactor analysis and extracting the chemical reactions pathways, discussions are completed. Results show that reducing the CD2 constant which leads to a decrease in time scale and volume fraction constants of the model would improve the performance of the model for MILD condition. Prediction of flame lift-off and minor OH species has been improved by changing default model constants of Cτ and Cγ to around 0.0893 and 1.0, respectively, especially for lower oxygen levels. Indeed reaction pathway analysis and dimension of reaction zone showed that reducing scales of the defined reactor in the EDC model (i.e. fine structure) to the Kolmogrov or smaller scales might push the reactions inside each structure toward the non-equilibrium condition and enlargement of overall reaction zone and make the EDC model more compatible with MILD combustion characteristics. Reduction in the length and time scales of the fine structure led to improvement in Temperature, OH, and CO profiles inside of MILD region of the JHC burner, although for CO, disagreement is still considerable. Considering error analysis of five checked parameters (i.e. H2O, CO2, OH, CO, and temperature) at both MILD and conventional regions of the JHC burner may conduct us toward that the defaults setting of the model still works reasonably on the whole when it is used at both regions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","EDC; Hydrogen; Methane; MILD combustion; Turbulence-chemistry interaction; Turbulent non-premixed combustion","Atomic physics; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Fuel burners; Hydrogen; Methane; Oxygen; Reaction kinetics; Reynolds number; Turbulence; Chemical mechanism; Computational domains; Diluted combustion; Eddy dissipation concept; MILD combustion; Nonequilibrium conditions; Turbulence-chemistry interactions; Turbulent non-premixed combustion; Chemical analysis"

To improve the analysis of our observed spectrum for Xe–N2O, a new method is developed based on the bound state calculations with three ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs). The accuracy of this method is validated by the excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental results for 152 rovibrational transition frequencies with a root mean square deviation of 0.00075 cm−1 and spectroscopic parameters with the deviation less than 0.6 MHz in the N2O monomer ν3 region. The rotational constants for the excited state are derived with the values of A = 12716.1, B = 1075.2, C = 987.9 MHz in the ν1 region of N2O monomer. The band origin of the spectrum is determined to be 1284.8760 cm−1 with a red shift of 0.0273 cm−1 compared with that of N2O monomer in the ν1 region.

We developed a watershed hydrogeochemical code RT-Flux-PIHM to understand complex interactions between hydrological processes (PIHM), land-surface processes (FLUX—Noah Land Surface Model), and multicomponent subsurface reactive transport (RT). The RT module simulates geochemical processes including aqueous complexation, surface complexation, mineral dissolution and precipitation, and cation exchange. The RT module is verified against the widely used reactive transport code CrunchFlow. The code uses semidiscrete finite volume method and irregular gridding and offers data harvesting capabilities from national databases. The application of RT-Flux-PIHM is demonstrated in the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO). We aim to understand key processes that govern hydrogeochemical dynamics of the nonreactive chloride and reactive magnesium. Simulation results indicate that watershed characteristics, in particular topography, dictate the spatial distributions of water content and soil dissolution rates. Ion exchange provides buffering capacities and leads to a hysteresis loop of concentration and discharge relationship of magnesium, which differs from the open hysteresis of chloride. RT-Flux-PIHM offers physics-based modeling capabilities to integrate the vast amount of water and chemistry data that have now become available, to differentiate the relative importance of competing processes, and to test hypotheses at the interface of hydrology and geochemistry. © 2017.

The developments of the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) have significantly improved the detection sensitivity and efficiency. However, they also introduce complications for the spectral assignments, for which advanced theoretical modeling has played an important role. Here we summarize some of our recent progresses for SERS and TERS, which generally combine both solid-state physics and quantum chemistry methods with two different schemes, namely the cluster model and the periodic boundary condition (PBC) model. In the cluster model, direct Raman spectra calculations are performed for the cluster taken from the accurate PBC structure. For PBC model, we have developed a quasi-analytical approach that enables us to calculate the Raman spectra of entire system. Under the TERS condition, the non-uniformity of plasmonic field in real space can drastically alter the interaction between the molecule and the light. By taking into account the local distributions of the plasmonic field, a new interaction Hamiltonian is constructed and applied to model the super-high-resolution Raman images of a single molecule. It shows that the resonant Raman images reflect the transition density between ground and excited states, which are generally vibrational insensitive. The nonresonant Raman images, on the other hand, allow to visualize the atomic movement of individual vibrational modes in real space. The inclusion of non-uniformity of plasmonic field provides ample opportunities to discover new physics and new applications in the future. WIREs Comput Mol Sci 2017, 7:e1293. doi: 10.1002/wcms.1293.

Detonation is thermodynamically more efficient than deflagration mode of combustion. Detonation combustion technology inside the pulse detonation engine using hydrogen as a fuel is energetic propulsion system for next generation. In this study, the main objective of this work is to quantify the exergetic efficiency of hydrogen–air combustion for deflagration and detonation combustion process. Further detonation parameters are calculated using 0.25, 0.35, and 0.55 of H2 mass concentrations in the combustion process. The simulations have been performed for converging the solution using commercial computational fluid dynamics package Ansys Fluent solver. The details of combustion physics in chemical reacting flows of hydrogen–air mixture in two control volumes were simulated using species transport model with eddy dissipation turbulence chemistry interaction. From these simulations it was observed that exergy loss in the deflagration combustion process is higher in comparison to the detonation combustion process. The major observation was that pilot fuel economy for the two combustion processes and augmentation of exergetic efficiencies are better in the detonation combustion process.

A component of this factor, considered in this paper, is the release of radon (Rn) from building materials to the living space of the room. This release takes place through different steps. These steps are represented and mathematically formulated. The diffusion of radon inside the material is described by Fick's second law. Some of the factors affecting the radon release rate (e.g. covering walls, moisture, structure of the building materials, etc.) are discussed. This scheme is used to study the impact of radon release on the gamma-radiation absorbed dose rate inside a room. The investigation is carried out by exploiting the MCNP simulation software. Different building materials are considered with different radon release rates. Special care is given to 222Rn due to its relatively higher half-life and higher indoor concentration than the other radon isotopes. The results of the presented model show that the radon release is of a significant impact in some building materials. © 2017 Health Physics Society.","222Rn; computer calculations; modeling, dose assessment; Monte Carlo","air pollutant; radon; air pollutant; analysis; building material; chemical model; chemistry; computer simulation; gamma radiation; indoor air pollution; procedures; radiation dose; radiation monitoring; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Air Pollutants, Radioactive; Air Pollution, Indoor; Computer Simulation; Construction Materials; Gamma Rays; Models, Chemical; Radiation Dosage; Radiation Monitoring; Radon; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity"

Series of MRI examinations were conducted on a diffusion model to study the behaviour of the diffusion process of different-molecular-weight (MW) paramagnetic MRI contrast agents in an isotropic agar hydrogel medium. The model consisted of a solidified 1 % agar gel with an initial concentration of 0.5 mmol/L contrast solution layered on top of the gel. The diffusion process was monitored at pre-determined time intervals of immediately, 1, 6, 9, 23, and 48 h after introduction of the contrast agents onto the agar gel with a T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) pulse sequence. Three types of paramagnetic contrast agents, Gd-DTPA with a MW of 547.57 g/mol, Prohance with a MW of 558.69 g/mol and MnCl2with a MW of 125.84 g/mol, resulted in an approximate average diffusional displacement ratio of 1:1:2 per hour, respectively, within 48 h of the experiment. Therefore, the results of this study supported the hypothesis that the rate of the diffusion process of MRI contrast agents in the agar hydrogel medium is inversely related to their MWs. However, more repetitions are necessary under various types of experimental conditions and also with various types of contrast media of different MWs for further confirmation and validation of these results. © 2016, Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics.","Diffusion; Isotropic hydrogel medium; Molecular weight; Paramagnetic contrast agents","chloride; contrast medium; gadolinium; gadolinium pentetate; gadoteridol; heterocyclic compound; hydrogel; manganese chloride; manganese derivative; metal; organometallic compound; chemistry; diffusion; hydrogel; imaging phantom; magnet; molecular weight; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; theoretical model; Chlorides; Contrast Media; Diffusion; Gadolinium; Gadolinium DTPA; Heterocyclic Compounds; Hydrogel; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnets; Manganese Compounds; Metals; Models, Theoretical; Molecular Weight; Organometallic Compounds; Phantoms, Imaging"

The code is built on top of the popular HOOMD-blue code, and as such harnesses the computational power of GPUs. The methodology makes use of the SAFT-γ Mie force field, so the resulting coarse grained pair potentials are both closely linked to and consistent with the macroscopic thermodynamic properties of the simulated fluid. In raaSAFT both homonuclear and heteronuclear models are implemented for a wide range of compounds spanning from linear alkanes, to more complicated fluids such as water and alcohols, all the way up to nonionic surfactants and models of asphaltenes and resins. Adding new compounds as well as new features is made straightforward by the modularity of the code. To demonstrate the ease-of-use of raaSAFT, we give a detailed walkthrough of how to simulate liquid–liquid equilibrium of a hydrocarbon with water. We describe in detail how both homonuclear and heteronuclear compounds are implemented. To demonstrate the performance and versatility of raaSAFT, we simulate a large polymer-solvent mixture with 300 polystyrene molecules dissolved in 42 700 molecules of heptane, reproducing the experimentally observed temperature-dependent solubility of polystyrene. For this case we obtain a speedup of more than three orders of magnitude as compared to atomistically-detailed simulations.

Since 223Ra is predominantly (95.3%) an alpha emitter with a 11.42 days long half-life, the radiopharmaceutical, its remnants, the patient, and waste material can be managed and disposed with low radiation protection requirements. 227Ac is a long-lived (T1/2 = 21.77 years) beta emitter that demands strong radiation protection measures. In particular waste disposal has to follow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and European Commission (EC) regulations. Since 227Ac is involved in the production of 223Ra, an impurity analysis of each batch is required after production. Due to time restrictions, the manufacturer's detection limit (&lt;0.001%) exceeds the one required to assure that 227Ac concentrations are below direct disposal levels. To improve the detection limit, long-term accurate spectroscopy is required. Alpha and gamma spectroscopy measurements were carried out at the Complutense University Nuclear Physics Laboratory. After twelve months follow up of a sample, 227Ac concentration was found to be smaller than 10−9. This allows for direct waste disposal and no additional radiation protection restrictions than those required for 223Ra. The presence of contamination by other radioisotopes was also ruled out by this experiment. Specifically 226Ra, involved in 223Ra production as the original parent and with a very long-lived (T1/2 = 1577 years) alpha emitter, was also below the experimental detection limit. © 2017 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica","Alpha emitters; Radiation protection; Radium-223; Spectroscopy","radioactive waste; radioisotope; radium; radium chloride ra 223; chemistry; gamma camera; human; occupational health; patient safety; procedures; radiation protection; radioactive waste; radiometry; spectroscopy; time factor; Gamma Cameras; Humans; Occupational Health; Patient Safety; Radiation Protection; Radioactive Waste; Radioisotopes; Radiometry; Radium; Spectrum Analysis; Time Factors"

The authors performed a retrospective analysis on 126 patients with primary HCC and hepatic metastatic disease from extrahepatic primary cancers who underwent radioembolization with glass or resin particles between 2008 and 2013 at their institution. Radiation activity estimates for prescribed treatments, as well as for the alternate embolization particles, were calculated using commonly employed formulae for both glass and resin particles for all treatments. A total of 217 treatments were performed on 126 patients, with 136 (62.7%) using glass particles and 81 (37.3%) using resin particles. Forty-six (36.5%) patients had metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), 51 (40.5%) had primary HCC, while 11 (8.7%) had neuroendocrine carcinoma, and 18 (14.3%) had metastases from other primary tumors. The average prescribed activity was 2.66 GBq for glass treatments and 1.06 GBq for resin treatments across all cancer types. When the alternative treatment activity was calculated, activities were projected to decrease by an average of 1.52 GBq per treatment if resin microspheres were used instead of glass microspheres (-52.5%), while activities were projected to increase by an average of 1.57 GBq per treatment if glass microspheres were used instead of resin microspheres (148.9%; p &lt; 0.001). Similar results were seen within each malignancy type and all projected changes were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, prescribed radiation activity for radioembolization of unresectable hepatic cancer was significantly lower for resin compared to glass microspheres. © 2017 Health Physics Society.","cancer; exposure, radiation; medical radiation; radiation therapy","acrylic acid resin; glass; microcapsule; brachytherapy; chemistry; comparative study; female; human; Liver Neoplasms; male; materials testing; microcapsule; middle aged; pathology; procedures; retrospective study; treatment outcome; Acrylic Resins; Brachytherapy; Capsules; Female; Glass; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Materials Testing; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome"

There is so much that synthetic materials can learn from proteins. This review discusses an emerging class of precision macromolecules called ""giant molecules"" in the context of materials genome initiative, as a tribute to the workhorse of Nature-the proteins. In protein science, modular protein domains can be tuned and combined in different ways to create new and versatile functions. Inspired by the ""domain"" concept, we draw an analogy between protein domains and molecular nanoparticles with the hope of developing ""artificial domains"" for synthetic polymers. Giant molecules are polymers built on such artificial domains. The two categories are then discussed in parallel with respect to their specific types, how they can be engineered, and how they would assemble hierarchically. Indeed, giant molecules share many features common with proteins and exhibit many unconventional hierarchically assembled structures and intriguing phase behaviors at different length, energy and time scales. The functions of giant molecules and their relation to the assembled hierarchical structures are under intense investigation, which shall pave the way to developing a modular and rational approach for advanced materials. Under the materials genome initiative, the field of giant molecules calls for an even closer, more dynamic and creative joint endeavor among chemistry, physics, and biology. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.",,

However, recent major insights from NMR that, at least in part, challenge certain views developed in the early years of cuprate research will be our focus: (i) The failure of a single-component spin susceptibility to adequately describe NMR shift data may indicate the presence of more than one electronic fluid. (ii) NMR quadrupole splittings provide a quantitative measure of local charges in the CuO2 plane, and we find unexpectedly large differences between different cuprate families. These local charges, measured with NMR, appear to set the maximum Tc and the superfluid density. A phase diagram using these local Cu and O charges rather than the total doping per CuO2, gives a unified view of all cuprates and further insight can be expected if cuprate properties are discussed in this context. (iii) Based on magnetic field dependent and new pressure dependent NMR experiments, a review of NMR literature data, and the measurability of local charges with NMR, we argue that dynamic charge density variations are likely a universal phenomenon in cuprate superconductors. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,

The activity was implemented during a course for pre-service secondary science teachers (PSSTs) specializing in physics and chemistry. The approach was explicit and reflective. Three research questions were posed: (1) What conceptions of NOS do the PSSTs show after a first reflective reading of the historical controversy?, (2) What role is played by the PSSTs’ whole class critical discussion of their first reflections on the aspects of NOS dealt with in the controversy?, and (3) What changes are there in the PSSTs’ conceptions of NOS after concluding the activity? The data for analysis was extracted from the PSSTs’ group reports submitted at the end of the activity and the audio-recorded information from the whole class discussion. A rubric was prepared to assess this data by a process of inter-rater analysis. The results showed overall improvement in understanding the aspects of NOS involved, with there being a significant evolution in some cases (e.g., conception of scientific theory) and moderate in others (e.g., differences in scientific interpretations of the same phenomenon). This reveals that the activity has an educational utility for the education of PSSTs in NOS issues.

In this work, we looked at the development of scientific research in the field of biofuels, as a sustainable source of energy, searching for references regarding its scientific roots and social relevance. Scientific communications on biofuels published between 1998 and 2007 were analyzed using a combination of bibliometric methods and text mining techniques. This field of research was characterized as interdisciplinary, with marked social relevance. Our bibliometric analysis shows that, in this research subject, 132 different, interacting fields of knowledge overlap, with dominance of Chemistry, Engineering and Agricultural Sciences. Through the use of text mining techniques, this field was configured into three groups of Disciplinary Dimensions. The first and most influential group includes the Agricultural Sciences, Social Sciences, and Environmental Sciences. The second group, which gives the field its technological basis, includes Chemistry, Engineering, and Microbiology. The third group includes disciplines with emerging involvement in the field of biofuels: Biology and Biochemistry, Animal and Plant Sciences, Molecular Biology and Genetics, Economics, Material Sciences, Nanosciences and Nanotechnology, Geosciences, Physics, Humanities, Multidisciplinary Sciences, Mathematics, and Computer Sciences. This study suggests that the first group of Disciplinary Dimensions conforms to the elements that socially validate the progress of research in the field of biofuels.

The Au nanoparticle arrays were characterized by the UV-vis, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The UV-vis and SEM measurements showed the uniformity of the surface-dispersed Au nanoparticles, and SERS measurement confirmed the chemistry of the PDMS film. Reflecting the high stability and the uniformity of the Au nanoparticle arrays, the plasmon wavelength of the Au nanoparticles reversely changed with modulation of the interparticle distance, which was induced by the stretching of the PDMS film. The plasmon wavelength linearly decreased from 664 to 591nm by stretching of 60%.

Such properties guarantee that PDT has an exceptionally broad action spectrum against tumors or pathogens, and resistance occurrence is restricted to only a few exceptions that can be avoided using simple strategies. To fully understand the intricacies of the mechanisms by which PDT acts, it is clear that one must take advantage of all the basic sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, and biology). In fact, such conceptual complexity still maintains constant scientific investigations to deeply understand the molecular basis of PDT. Curiously, it might also be one of the reasons to explain why this hundred-year-old technique is still not generally applied in clinics or taught in standard courses of pharmacology. In thischapter, we will attempt to use a multidisciplinary approach, with simple technical language and a minimum of mathematics and equations, to allow any student with minimal training in basic sciences to understand all the fundamental mechanisms of PDT. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Low friction hard coatings are extensively used in power train and engine applications by wear inhibition and friction reduction. The present study evaluates friction and wear responses of CrN and CrN/GLC coatings in different lubricated conditions. Results showed that, the presence of GLC surface not only lowered friction significantly by 67% under oil-starved or even dry conditions, but also obtained a pronounced decrease in wear by 70% for the opposite surface in the oil-lubricated environment, as compared to CrN coating. GLC application thus allowed the engine components to operate more reliably and durably when improper conditions happened. A tribochemical layer with the responsive character accounted for superior performance of GLC/CrN coating, which derived from the interactions of the additive in oil with the rubbing surfaces.

Those effects are difficult to model at regional scale as regional chemistry-transport models are usually driven by a distinct meteorological model or data. In this paper, the coupling of the CHIMERE chemistry-transport model with the WRF meteorological model using the OASIS3-MCT coupler is presented. WRF meteorological fields along with CHIMERE aerosol optical properties are exchanged through the coupler at a high frequency in order to model the aerosol-radiation interactions. The WRF-CHIMERE online model has a higher computational burden than both models run separately in offline mode (up to 42 % higher). This is mainly due to some additional computations made within the models such as more frequent calls to meteorology treatment routines or calls to optical properties computation routines. On the other hand, the overall time required to perform the OASIS3-MCT exchanges is not significant compared to the total duration of the simulations. The impact of the coupling is evaluated on a case study over Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East and western Asia during the summer of 2012, through comparisons of the offline and two online simulations (with and without the aerosol optical properties feedback) to observations of temperature, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface PM10 (particulate matter with diameters lower than 10 μm) concentrations. The result shows that using the optical properties feedback induces a radiative forcing (average forcing of-4.8 W-2) which creates a perturbation in the average surface temperatures over desert areas (up to 2.6° locally) along with an increase in both AOD and PM10 concentrations. © 2017 Author(s).",,"aerosol; aerosol property; atmospheric transport; cloud microphysics; concentration (composition); condensation; radiation budget; radiative forcing; Europe; Far East; Middle East; North Africa"

Within the model, a single electron and nucleus move in two dimensions in an external static field. It is demonstrated that the nuclear density conserves its initial Gaussian shape when directly passing the CoIn, whereas the electronic density remains approximately constant. This is in sharp contrast to the picture which evolves from an analysis within the basis of adiabatic electronic states. There, dramatic changes are seen in the dynamics of the different nuclear components of the total wave function. It is thus documented that, in the case of a highly efficient population transfer between the respective adiabatic states, neither the nuclear nor the electronic density is influenced by the existence of a CoIn. This is the case because the nuclear-electronic wave packet moves on the complete potential energy surface which changes its topology smoothly as a function of all particle coordinates. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Dynamics; Excited states; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Rate constants; Wave functions; Wave packets; Conical intersection; Electron-nuclear dynamics; Electronic density; Nuclear components; Nuclear densities; Nuclear electronics; Nuclear wave packet; Population transfer; Electronic document exchange"

They are unique systems that are distinctly different from common colloids, such as, e.g., rigid nanoparticles, flexible macromolecules, micelles, or vesicles. The size of the microgel networks is in the range of several micrometers down to nanometers (then sometimes called “nanogels”). In a collapsed state, they might resemble hard colloids but they can still contain significant amounts of solvent. When swollen, they are soft and have a fuzzy surface with dangling chains. The presence of cross-links provides structural integrity, in contrast to linear and (hyper)branched polymers. Obviously, the cross-linker content will allow control of whether microgels behave more “colloidal” or “macromolecular”. The combination of being soft and porous while still having a stable structure through the cross-linked network allows for designing microgels that have the same total chemical composition, but different properties due to a different architecture. Microgels based, e.g., on two monomers but have either statistical spatial distribution, or a core-shell or hollow-two-shell morphology will display very different properties. Microgels provide the possibility to introduce chemical functionality at different positions. Combining architectural diversity and compartmentalization of reactive groups enables thus short-range coexistence of otherwise instable combinations of chemical reactivity. The open microgel structure is beneficial for uptake-release purposes of active substances. In addition, the openness allows site-selective integration of active functionalities like reactive groups, charges, or markers by postmodification processes. The unique ability of microgels to retain their colloidal stability and swelling degree both in water and in many organic solvents allows use of different chemistries for the modification of microgel structure. The capability of microgels to adjust both their shape and volume in response to external stimuli (e.g., temperature, ionic strength and composition, pH, electrochemical stimulus, pressure, light) provides the opportunity to reversibly tune their physicochemical properties. From a physics point of view, microgels are particularly intriguing and challenging, since their intraparticle properties are intimately linked to their interparticle behavior. Microgels, which reveal interface activity without necessarily being amphiphilic, develop even more complex behavior when located at fluid or solid interfaces: the sensitivity of microgels to various stimuli allows, e.g., the modulation of emulsion stability, adhesion, sensing, and filtration. Hence, we envision an ever-increasing relevance of microgels in these fields including biomedicine and process technology. In sum, microgels unite properties of very different classes of materials. Microgels can be based on very different (bio)macromolecules such as, e.g., polysaccharides, peptides, or DNA, as well as on synthetic polymers. This Account focuses on synthetic microgels (mainly based on acrylamides); however, the general, fundamental features of microgels are independent of the chemical nature of the building moieties. Microgels allow combining features of chemical functionality, structural integrity, macromolecular architecture, adaptivity, permeability, and deformability in a unique way to include the “best” of the colloidal, polymeric, and surfactant worlds. This will open the door for novel applications in very different fields such as, e.g., in sensors, catalysis, and separation technology. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,

In order to determine lattice energies taken into account in this study, Born–Haber–Fajans (BHF) thermochemical cycle and lattice energy equations proposed by Jenkins and Kaya were used. It is shown that bond force constant of a simple ionic compound can be easily calculated in agreement with its spectroscopic counterpart through its lattice energy value.

The characteristics of the potential energy surface, such as the barrier to relative sliding of the layers and magnitude of corrugation, and physically measurable properties associated with relative in-plane and out-of-plane motion of the layers including the shear modulus and modulus for axial compression, shear mode frequency and frequency of out-of-plane vibrations are considered.

Commun. 2013, 49, 10826). We find that the ring opening of the α-anomer yields the most stable open-chain tautomer which step is followed by the rotational interconversion of the open-chain rotamers and final ring closing to form the β-anomer. Our results indicate the flatness of the reaction's potential energy surface (PES) corresponding to the rotational interconversion path and its sensitivity to the computational level. By using the explicitly correlated coupled cluster CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 energies, we determine the free energy barrier for the α-furanose ring-opening (rate-determining) step as 170.3 kJ/mol. The question of the number of water molecules (n) needed for optimal stabilization of the erythrose anomerization reaction rate-determining transition state is addressed by a systematic exploration of the PES of the ring opening in the α-anomer-(H2O)n and various β-anomer-(H2O)n (n = 1–3) clusters using density functional and CCSD(T)-F12 computations. These computations suggest the lowest free energy barrier of the ring opening for doubly hydrated α-anomer, achieved by a mechanism that involves water-mediated multiple proton transfer coupled with the furanose CO bond breakage. Among the methods used, the G4 performed best against the CCSD(T)-F12 reference at estimating the ring-opening barrier heights for both the hydrated and bare erythrose conformers.

However, they are poorly understood, partly because they are difficult to measure directly and model accurately. We present both a spectroscopic experimental investigation and a theoretical model for the interfacial field at the junction of a conductor and a dielectric. First, we present vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) results of the nitrile (CN) stretch of 4-mercaptobenzonitrile (4-MBN) covalently attached to a gold surface and in contact with a variety of liquid dielectrics. It is found that the CN stretch frequency red-shifts with increasing dielectric constant. Second, we build a model in direct analogy to the well-known Onsager reaction field theory, which has been successful in predicting vibrational frequency shifts in bulk dielectric media. Clearly, due to the asymmetric environment, with metal on one side and a dielectric on the other, the bulk Onsager model is not applicable at the interface. To address this, we apply the Onsager model to the interface accounting for the asymmetry. The model successfully explains the red-shift of the CN stretch as a function of the dielectric constant and is used to estimate the reaction field near the interface. We show the similarities and differences between the conventional bulk Onsager model and the interfacial reaction field model. In particular, the model emphasizes the importance of the metal as part of the solvation environment of the tethered molecules. We anticipate that our work will be of fundamental value to understand the crucial and often elusive electric fields at interfaces. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Dielectric properties of liquids; Doppler effect; Electric fields; Interferometry; Solvation; Bulk dielectric; Experimental investigations; Liquid dielectrics; Reaction fields; Tethered molecules; Theoretical modeling; Vibrational frequency shift; Vibrational sum-frequency generations; Dielectric materials; 4 mercaptobenzonitrile; gold; nitrile; unclassified drug; Article; chromatophore; dielectric constant; hydrogen bond; solvation; spectroscopy; theoretical model; vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy"

The large number of different models indicates that this task is by no means an easy one. Some models are reasonably successful for various properties, while others are designed to account for only a very few specific features of water accurately. Among the most popular models are SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP4P/2005, TIP4P/Ice, and TIP5P-E. Here, we report the equilibrium properties of the liquid-vapor coexistence, such as the densities of the liquid phase and the vapor phase, the interfacial tension between them, and the vapor pressure at saturation. From these data, the critical parameters are determined and subsequently used to cast the liquid-vapor coexistence properties into a corresponding-states form following Guggenheim’s suggestions. Doing so reveals that the three TIP4P-based models display the same corresponding-states behavior and that the SPC/E model behaves quite similarly. Only the TIP5P-E model shows clear deviations from the corresponding-states properties of the other models. A comparison with data for real water shows that the reduced surface tension is well described, while the reduced coexistence curve is too wide. The models underestimate the critical compressibility factor and overestimate Guggenheim’s ratio as well as the reduced boiling temperature (Guldberg’s ratio). As demonstrated by the collapse of the data for the TIP4P-based models, these deviations are inherent to the specific model and cannot be corrected by a simple reparametrization. For comparison, the results for two recent polarizable models, HBP and BK3, are shown, and both models are seen to perform well in terms of absolute numbers and in a corresponding-states framework. The kind of analysis applied here can therefore be used as a guideline in the design of more accurate and yet simple multi-purpose models of water. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Physical chemistry; Physics; Atomistic potential; Boiling temperature; Coexistence curve; Corresponding state; Critical compressibility; Equilibrium properties; Liquid vapor equilibrium; nocv1; Reparametrization; Liquids"

This understanding is incomplete if it does not take into account temperature effects, which play a crucial role in phase transitions and changes in the overall stability of the particles. Finite size particles present intricate potential energy surfaces, and rigorous descriptions of temperature effects are best achieved by exploiting extended ensemble algorithms, such as the Parallel Tempering Monte Carlo (PTMC). In this study, we employed the PTMC algorithm, implemented from scratch, to sample configurations of LJn (n=38, 55, 98, 147) particles at a wide range of temperatures. The heat capacities and phase transitions obtained with our PTMC implementation are consistent with all the expected features for the LJ nanoclusters, e.g., solid to solid and solid to liquid. To identify the known phase transitions and assess the prevalence of various structural motifs available at different temperatures, we propose a combination of a Leader-like clustering algorithm based on a Euclidean metric with the PTMC sampling. This combined approach is further compared with the more computationally demanding bond order analysis, typically employed for this kind of problem. We show that the clustering technique yields the same results in most cases, with the advantage that it requires no previous knowledge of the parameters defining each geometry. Being simple to implement, we believe that this straightforward clustering approach is a valuable data analysis tool that can provide insights into the physics of finite size particles with few to thousand atoms at a relatively low cost. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Atoms; Monte Carlo methods; Nanoclusters; Particle size analysis; Phase transitions; Potential energy; Quantum chemistry; Temperature; Tempering; Thermodynamic stability; Bond-order analysis; Clustering approach; Clustering techniques; Data analysis tool; Ensemble algorithms; Finite-Size particles; Overall stabilities; Parallel tempering; Clustering algorithms"

From what we observe, models are derived and we can get an understanding about how things work by simulating our models. This has been particularly important in areas such as medicine, physics, chemistry. However, when we do not initiate simulations but that we are simply observing a phenomenon, it is valuable to be able to understand it 'on the fly' and be able to predict its future behavior. Added challenges come from the fact that observations are never 100% accurate and therefore we must deal with uncertainty. In this work, we use Interval Constraint Solving Techniques (ICST) to handle uncertainty in the observations of a given phenomenon, and to be able to determine its initial conditions and unfold the dynamic behavior further in time. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Logic programming; Dynamic behaviors; Dynamic problem; Initial conditions; Interval constraint; Natural phenomena; On the flies; Codes (symbols)"

In particular, the C1B2 ← X1A1 UV photoabsorption spectrum has received considerable attention. This spectrum exhibits a highly regular progression of ∼20 or so strong peaks, spaced roughly 350 cm-1 apart, which is comparable to the C1B2 bending vibrational frequency. Accordingly, they have for decades been largely attributed to the (1, v2′, 2) ← (0, 0, 0) bend progression. Using a highly accurate new ab initio potential energy surface (PES) for the C1B2 state, we compute vibrational energy levels and wave functions, and compare with a photoabsorption calculation obtained using the same PES and corresponding C1B2 ← X1A1 transition dipole surface (TDS).

We introduce polarized femtosecond XANES, combined with UV-visible spectroscopy, to reveal sequential structural evolution of CNCbl in the excited electronic state. Femtosecond polarized XANES provides the crucial structural dynamics link between computed potential energy surfaces and optical transient absorption spectroscopy. Polarization selectivity can be used to uniquely identify electronic contributions and structural changes, even in isotropic samples when welldefined electronic transitions are excited. Our XANES measurements reveal that the structural changes upon photoexcitation occur mainly in the axial direction, where elongation of the axial Co-CN bond and Co-NIm bond on a 110 fs time scale is followed by corrin ring relaxation on a 260 fs time scale.

The FET shows a continuous metal-insulator transition (MIT) as electrostatic doping proceeds. The phase transition appears to involve two-step crossovers, one in Hall measurement and the other in conductivity measurement. The crossover in conductivity occurs around the conductance quantum e2/h, and hence is not associated with ""bad metal"" behavior, which is in stark contrast to the MIT in half-filled organic Mott insulators or that in doped inorganic Mott insulators. Through in-depth scaling analysis of the conductivity, it is found that the above carrier transport properties in the vicinity of the MIT can be described by a high-temperature Mott quantum critical crossover, which is theoretically argued to be a ubiquitous feature of various types of Mott transitions. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","field-effect transistor; Hall effect; metal-insulator transition; Mott transition; quantum critical scaling; SAM patterning","Doping (additives); Field effect transistors; Hall effect; High energy physics; Metal insulator boundaries; Metals; Quantum chemistry; Quantum Hall effect; Semiconductor insulator boundaries; Single crystals; Transport properties; Conductance quantum; Conductivity measurements; Electrostatic doping; Hall measurements; Mott transitions; Quantum critical scaling; SAM patterning; Single-crystalline; Metal insulator transition"

A covariantly formulated bootstrap equation is solved to generate the zoo of these particles characterized baryon number B, strangeness S and electric charge Q. These hadron-like resonances are characterized by being very massive and by not being limited to quantum numbers of known hadrons. All hadronic properties like masses, spectral functions etc. are taken from the hadronic transport model Ultra Relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD). Decay chains of single Hagedorn states provide a well description of experimentally observed multiplicity ratios of strange and multi-strange particles as the Ξ0- and the Ω--baryon. In addition, the final energy spectra of resulting hadrons show a thermal-like distribution with the characteristic Hagedorn temperature TH.

The bound-free transitions in H- dominate the visible opacity in stars with photospheric temperatures less than 7000 K, including the Sun. The H- anion is also believed to have been critical to the formation of molecular hydrogen in the very early evolution of the Universe. Once H2 formed, about 500000 years after the Big Bang, the expanding gas was able to lose internal gravitational energy and collapse to form stellar objects and ""protogalaxies"", allowing the creation of heavier elements such as C, N, and O through nucleosynthesis. Although astronomers had considered some processes through which anions might form in interstellar clouds and circumstellar envelopes, including the important role that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons might play in this, it was the detection in 2006 of rotational line emission from C6H- that galvanized a systematic study of the abundance, distribution, and chemistry of anions in the interstellar medium. In 2007, the Cassini mission reported the unexpected detection of anions with mass-to-charge ratios of up to ∼10 000 in the upper atmosphere of Titan; this observation likewise instigated the study of fundamental chemical processes involving negative ions among planetary scientists. In this article, we review the observations of anions in interstellar clouds, circumstellar envelopes, Titan, and cometary comae. We then discuss a number of processes by which anions can be created and destroyed in these environments. The derivation of accurate rate coefficients for these processes is an essential input for the chemical kinetic modeling that is necessary to fully extract physics from the observational data. We discuss such models, along with their successes and failings, and finish with an outlook on the future. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Aromatic hydrocarbons; Astrophysics; C (programming language); Chemical detection; Chemical elements; Ions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Stars; Upper atmosphere; Bound-free transitions; Chemical kinetic model; Circumstellar envelopes; Gravitational energy; Interstellar clouds; Interstellar mediums; Mass-to-charge ratio; Planetary scientist; Negative ions"

Using the example of the spin-boson model, we formulate the inchworm expansion in two distinct ways: The first with respect to an expansion in the system-bath coupling and the second as an expansion in the diabatic coupling. The latter approach motivates the development of a cumulant version of the inchworm Monte Carlo method, which has the benefit of improved scaling.

Theoretical studies based on mixed quantum/classical calculations provide a powerful way to analyze those experiments. A statistically meaningful result can be obtained from the calculations by solving the vibrational Schrödinger equation over many numbers of molecular configurations. The discrete variable representation (DVR) method is a useful technique to calculate vibrational eigenstates subject to an arbitrary anharmonic potential surface. Considering the large number of molecular configurations over which the DVR calculations are repeated, the calculations are desired to be optimized in balance between the cost and accuracy. We determine a dimension of the DVR method which appears to be optimum for the calculations of the three states of molecular vibrations with anharmonic strengths often found in realistic molecular systems. We apply the numerical technique to calculate the local OH stretching frequencies of liquid water, which are well known to be widely distributed due to the inhomogeneity in molecular configuration, and found that the frequencies of the 0-1 and 1-2 transitions are highly correlated. An empirical relation between the two frequencies is suggested and compared with the experimental data of nonlinear IR spectroscopies. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Physical chemistry; Physics; Anharmonic potential; Discrete variable representation; Empirical relations; Molecular configurations; nocv1; Nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy; Numerical techniques; Oh stretching frequencies; Vibrational eigenstates; Quantum theory"

However, they are very different. Single reference coupled cluster is highly successful for treating weakly correlated systems but fails under strong correlation unless one sacrifices good quantum numbers and works with broken-symmetry wave functions, which is unphysical for finite systems. Symmetry projection is effective for the treatment of strong correlation at the mean-field level through multireference non-orthogonal configuration interaction wavefunctions, but unlike coupled cluster, it is neither size extensive nor ideal for treating dynamic correlation. We here examine different scenarios for merging these two dissimilar theories. We carry out this exercise over the integrable Lipkin model Hamiltonian, which despite its simplicity, encompasses non-trivial physics for degenerate systems and can be solved via diagonalization for a very large number of particles. We show how symmetry projection and coupled cluster doubles individually fail in different correlation limits, whereas models that merge these two theories are highly successful over the entire phase diagram. Despite the simplicity of the Lipkin Hamiltonian, the lessons learned in this work will be useful for building an ab initio symmetry projected coupled cluster theory that we expect to be accurate in the weakly and strongly correlated limits, as well as the recoupling regime. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Cluster analysis; Electronic structure; Hamiltonians; Merging; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Wave functions; Correlated systems; Coupled-cluster theory; Diagonalizations; Dynamic correlation; Electronic structure theory; Mean-field level; Projection method; Strong correlation; Numerical methods"

This paper studies planar discrete PoissonVoronoi tessellations constructed directly by the growth to impingement of random square germs. They materially differ from similar tessellations constructed of the nearest tile loci according to the basic definition. The boundary structure is described in detail. Its peculiarities are used to extend the concept of Gabriel edges to the considered discrete case and also to quantify this concept. The averaged percentage of Gabriel edges appears to be practically independent of the germs density, G = 70%. The studied densities range from 0.01 to 0.000 01. Statistical results are presented for the whole tessellation and also for subsets of random domains with the given number of edges V. Two sets of results are compared: for edges of each random domain arranged from the longest to the shortest and for edges arranged from the nearest to the most distant. Averaged distances to neighbours in the metric determined by the growth mode of islands are compared with that in the Euclidean metric. Also, the cyclic sequences of edge lengths of random domains are examined. The linearity with respect to v is revealed for four scaling-related characteristics: the area of random domains, the perimeter length of random domains, the area of complete concentric belts, and the coordinates of maxima of kinetic curves. © 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.","interfaces in random media; kinetic growth processes; stochastic processes; surface effects",

We have developed a new 2-dimensional Coulomb explosion imaging setup in which a hitherto-impractical camera angle is realized. In our imaging technique, diatomic molecules are irradiated with a circularly polarized strong laser pulse. The ejected atomic ions are accelerated perpendicularly to the laser propagation. The ions lying in the laser polarization plane are selected through the use of a mechanical slit and imaged with a high-throughput, 2-dimensional detector installed parallel to the polarization plane. Because a circularly polarized (isotropic) Coulomb exploding pulse is used, the observed angular distribution of the ejected ions directly corresponds to the squared rotational wave function at the time of the pulse irradiation. To create a real-time movie of molecular rotation, the present imaging technique is combined with a femtosecond pump-probe optical setup in which the pump pulses create unidirectionally rotating molecular ensembles. Due to the high image throughput of our detection system, the pump-probe experimental condition can be easily optimized by monitoring a real-time snapshot. As a result, the quality of the observed movie is sufficiently high for visualizing the detailed wave nature of motion. We also note that the present technique can be implemented in existing standard ion imaging setups, offering a new camera angle or viewpoint for the molecular systems without the need for extensive modification. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.","Chemistry; Coherent control; Femtochemistry; Femtosecond laser; Intense laser field; Issue 120; Molecular alignment; Molecular dynamics; Molecular physics; Pump-probe experiment; Rotational wave packet; Slice imaging; Ultrafast phenomena; Velocity-map imaging",

Applying the variational principle, we derive pseudoeigenvalue equations for these two amplitudes, which cast the internal Schrödinger equation in a form akin to the Born-Oppenheimer separation of nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in molecules. The marginal equation involves an effective radial Hamiltonian, which contains a nonadiabatic potential energy surface that takes into account all interparticle correlations in an averaged way, and whose unique eigenvalue is the internal energy. At each point (r1,r2), such surface is, in turn, the unique eigenvalue in the conditional equation. Employing the ground state of He as prototype, we show that the nonadiabatic potential energy surface affords a molecularlike interpretation of the structure of the atom, and aids in the analysis of energetic and spatial aspects of the Coulomb correlation, in particular correlation-induced symmetry breaking and quantum phase transition. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,"Atoms; Coulomb blockade; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Ground state; Molecular physics; Phase transitions; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Rate constants; Born-Oppenheimer separation; Coulomb correlations; Inter-particle correlations; Interelectronic distance; Quantum phase transitions; Two-electron atoms; Unique factorization; Variational principles; Potential energy"

These are commonly obtained through data fitting, an approach that presents some shortcomings. On the other hand, it is possible to derive auxiliary basis sets by removing elements from the product space of both contracted and primitive orbitals by means of a particular form of inner projection technique that has come to be known as Cholesky decomposition (CD). This procedure allows for on-the-fly construction of auxiliary basis sets that may be used in conjunction with any quantum chemical method, i.e. unbiased auxiliary basis sets. One key feature of these sets is that they represent the electron-repulsion integral matrix in atomic orbital basis with an accuracy that can be systematically improved. Another key feature is represented by the fact that locality of fitting coefficients is obtained even with the long-ranged Coulomb metric, as result of integral accuracy. Here we report on recent advances in the development of the CD-based density fitting technology. In particular, the implementation of analytical gradients algorithms is reviewed and the present status of local formulations – potentially linear scaling – is analysed in detail. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","Cholesky decomposition; density fitting; linear scaling; Löwdin's inner projections; Quantum chemistry","Molecular physics; Cholesky decomposition; Density fitting; Density fitting technique; Electron repulsion integrals; Inner projection; Linear scaling; Quantum-chemical methods; Two-electron integrals; Quantum chemistry"

This review will focus on isolated functional fibers (eg, fiber supplements) whose effects on clinical outcomes have been readily assessed in well-controlled clinical studies. This review will also focus on three health benefits (cholesterol lowering, improved glycemic control, and normalizing stool form [constipation and diarrhea]) for which reproducible evidence of clinical efficacy has been published. In the small bowel, clinically meaningful health benefits (eg, cholesterol lowering and improved glycemic control) are highly correlated with the viscosity of soluble fibers: high viscosity fibers (eg, gel-forming fibers such as b-glucan, psyllium, and raw guar gum) exhibit a significant effect on cholesterol lowering and improved glycemic control, whereas nonviscous soluble fibers (eg, inulin, fructooligosaccharides, and wheat dextrin) and insoluble fibers (eg, wheat bran) do not provide these viscosity-dependent health benefits. In the large bowel, there are only two mechanisms that drive a laxative effect: large/coarse insoluble fiber particles (eg, wheat bran) mechanically irritate the gut mucosa stimulating water and mucous secretion, and the high water-holding capacity of gel-forming soluble fiber (eg, psyllium) resists dehydration. Both mechanisms require that the fiber resist fermentation and remain relatively intact throughout the large bowel (ie, the fiber must be present in stool), and both mechanisms lead to increased stool water content, resulting in bulky/soft/easy-to-pass stools. Soluble fermentable fibers (eg, inulin, fructooligosaccharide, and wheat dextrin) do not provide a laxative effect, and some fibers can be constipating (eg, wheat dextrin and fine/smooth insoluble wheat bran particles). When making recommendations for a fiber supplement, it is essential to recognize which fibers possess the physical characteristics required to provide a beneficial health effect, and which fiber supplements are supported by reproducible, rigorous evidence of one or more clinically meaningful health benefits. © 2017 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics","Fiber; Health benefits; Insoluble; Misconceptions; Soluble","beta glucan; cholesterol; galactan; glucose blood level; guar gum; inulin; ispagula; laxative; mannan; plant gum; administration and dosage; blood; chemistry; dietary fiber; evidence based medicine; feces; gastrointestinal tract; glucose blood level; human; metabolism; randomized controlled trial (topic); viscosity; beta-Glucans; Blood Glucose; Cholesterol; Dietary Fiber; Evidence-Based Medicine; Feces; Galactans; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Inulin; Laxatives; Mannans; Plant Gums; Psyllium; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Viscosity"

We have examined the correlation between iso-conversional activation energy and iso-conversional rate of crystal growth. In fact, we have observed the compensation law and iso-kinetic relationship using two different approaches for the study of crystallization phenomenon that drives thermally in an Arrhenian manner. Moreover, we found that the estimated intercepts and gradients (i.e., Meyer-Neldel energy and Meyer-Neldel pre-factor respectively) for both approaches also vary linearly and both sets are remarkably identical.

Using experimental data created by Hunter and Vogelaar, the formula precisely reproduces experimental results for the standardized Kla at 20 °C, comparatively better than the current model used by ASCE 2–06 based on the equation Kla20 = Kla. (θ)(20−T) where T is in °C. Currently, reported values for θ range from 1.008 to 1.047. Because it is a geometric function, large error can result if an incorrect value of θ is used. Establishment of such value for an aeration system can only be made by means of series of full scale testing over a range of temperatures required. The new model predicts oxygen transfer coefficients to within 1% error compared to observed measurements. This is a breakthrough since the correct prediction of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient (Kla) is a crucial step in the design, operation and scale up of bioreactors including wastewater treatment plant aeration tanks, and the equation developed allows doing so without resorting to multiple full scale testing for each individual tank under the same testing condition for different temperatures. The effect of temperature on the transfer rate coefficient Kla is explored in this paper, and it is recommended to replace the current model by this new model given by: Kla20=Kla(Eρσ)20(Eρσ)T(T20T)5 where T is in degree Kelvin, and the subscripts refer to degree Celsius; E, ρ, σ are properties of water. Furthermore, using data from published data on oxygen solubility in water, it was found that solubility bears a linear and inverse relationship with the mass transfer coefficient. © 2017 The Authors","Chemical engineering; Civil engineering; Energy; Physical chemistry; Physics methods",

Of the two structural isomers of CH3O, methoxy is the only radical whose astronomical detection has been reported through the observation of several rotational lines at 2 and 3 mm wavelengths. Although the hydroxymethyl radical, CH2OH, is known to be thermodynamically the most stable (by ~3300 cm-1), it has so far eluded rotational spectroscopy presumably because of its high chemical reactivity. Aims. Recent high-resolution (~10 MHz) sub-Doppler rovibrationally resolved infrared spectra of CH2OH (symmetric CH stretching a-type band) provided accurate ground vibrational state rotational constants, thus reviving the quest for its millimeter-wave spectrum in laboratory and subsequently in space. Methods. The search and assignment of the rotational spectrum of this fundamental species were guided by our quantum chemical calculations and by using rotational constants derived from high-resolution IR data. The hydroxymethyl radical was produced by hydrogen abstraction from methanol by atomic chlorine. Results. Ninety-six b-type rotational transitions between the v = 0 and v = 1 tunnelling sublevels involving 25 fine-structure components of Q branches (with Ka = 1 ← 0) and 4 fine-structure components of R branches (assigned to Ka = 0 ← 1) were measured below 402 GHz. Hyperfine structure alternations due to the two identical methylenic hydrogens were observed and analysed based on the symmetry and parity of the rotational levels. A global fit including infrared and millimeter-wave lines has been conducted using Pickett's reduced axis system Hamiltonian. The recorded transitions (odd ΔKa) did not allow us to evaluate the Coriolis tunnelling interaction term. The comparison of the experimentally determined constants for both tunnelling levels with their computed values secures the long-awaited first detection of the rotational-tunnelling spectrum of this radical. In particular, a tunnelling rate of 139.73 ± 0.10 MHz (4.6609(32) × 10-3 cm-1) was obtained along with the rotational constants, electron spin-rotation interaction parameters and several hyperfine coupling terms. Conclusions. The laboratory characterization of CH2OH by millimeter-wave spectroscopy now offers the possibility for its astronomical detection for the first time. © 2017 ESO.","ISM: molecules; Molecular data; Submillimeter: ISM","Atomic physics; Hamiltonians; Isomers; Magnetic moments; Methanol; Quantum chemistry; Rate constants; Spin dynamics; Ground vibrational state; ISM: molecules; Millimeter wave spectra; Millimeter-wave spectroscopy; Molecular data; Quantum chemical calculations; Rotational spectroscopy; Submillimeter: isms; Millimeter waves"

It decomposes a PES into a canonical low-rank tensor format, reducing its integral into a relatively short sum of products of low-dimensional integrals. The decomposition is achieved by the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm, requiring only a small number of single-point energy evaluations. Therefore, it eradicates a force-constant evaluation as the hotspot of many quantum dynamics simulations and also possibly lifts the curse of dimensionality. This general method is applied to the anharmonic vibrational zero-point and transition energy calculations of molecules using the second-order diagrammatic vibrational many-body Green's function (XVH2) theory with a harmonic-approximation reference. In this application, high dimensional PES and Green's functions are both subjected to a low-rank decomposition. Evaluating the molecular integrals over a low-rank PES and Green's functions as sums of low-dimensional integrals using the Gauss–Hermite quadrature, this canonical-tensor-decomposition-based XVH2 (CT-XVH2) achieves an accuracy of 0.1 cm−1 or higher and nearly an order of magnitude speedup as compared with the original algorithm using force constants for water and formaldehyde. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","anharmonic vibrations; Green's function theory; Potential energy surfaces; tensor decomposition","Dynamics; Function evaluation; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Tensors; Alternating least squares; Anharmonic vibrations; Curse of dimensionality; Harmonic approximation; High-dimensional integrals; Low-rank decomposition; Quantum dynamics simulation; Tensor decomposition; Potential energy surfaces"

The model coupled species, electron and ion transport through the porous cathode to surface and electro-chemistry. The electrochemical reduction of O2 was modeled using three candidate elementary kinetic mechanisms. Each mechanism included parallel surface and bulk pathways for O2 reduction and was driven by three different electric phase potentials. The mechanisms were compared against three sets of electrochemical impedance spectra and polarization curves measured by Barbucci et al. (2009), Cronin et al. (2012) and Nielsen and Hjelm (2014) over a wide range of operating temperatures (873–1173 K), inlet O2 concentrations (5–100%) and overpotentials (−1 V to +1 V). Two of the three mechanisms were able to quantitatively reproduce the three sets of experiments by only tweaking the microstructural parameters for each individual set. Yet on analyzing their kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, the mechanism postulating the chemisorption of gas-phase O2 on LSM to form the superoxo-like adsorbate O2 - was determined to be the most realistic. A model-based sensitivity analysis revealed that ionic transport in the YSZ phase, O2 dissociation in conjunction with surface to bulk charge transfer in the LSM phase and charge transfer at the three phase boundary were the rate limiting steps throughout the operating space.

These mappings redistribute the quadrature points in many different ways. The approach in this paper is to compute the radial integrals with the Gauss–Maxwell nonclassical quadrature defined by the weight function w(r)=r2e-r2 appropriate for the semi-infinite interval and to also use scaling of the quadrature points.

Within this strategy, electronic noses based on the direct coupling of a headspace sampler with a mass spectrometer (HS-MS) have been proposed. Nevertheless, this coupling is not suitable for the analysis of non-volatile compounds. In order to propose an alternative to HS-MS determinations for non-volatile compounds, here we present the first ‘proof of concept’ use of the direct coupling of microextraction by packed sorbents (MEPS) to a mass spectrometer device using an electron ionization (EI) and a single quadrupole as ionization source and analyzer, respectively. As target compounds, a set of analytes with different physic-chemical properties were evaluated (2-ethyl-1-hexanol, styrene, 2-heptanone, among others). The use of MEPS extraction present many advantages, such as it is fast, simple, easy to automate and requires small volumes of sample and organic solvents. Moreover, MEPS cartridges are re-usable as samples can be extracted more than 100 times using the same syringe. In order to introduce into the system all the elution volume from the MEPS extraction, a programmable temperature vaporizer (PTV) is proposed as the injector device. Results obtained with the proposed methodology (MEPS-PTV/MS) were compared with the ones obtained based on the separative scheme, i.e. using gas chromatography separation (MEPS-PTV-GC/MS), and both methods provided similar results. Limits of detection were found to be between 3.26 and 146.6 μg L−1 in the non-separative scheme and between 0.02 and 1.72 μg L−1 when the separative methodology was used.

The coal is geologically associated with a uranium deposit and has been used as a fossil fuel in a thermal power plant in the city. Samples were initially prepared at LABIDRO (Isotopes and Hydrochemistry Laboratory), UNESP, Rio Claro (SP), Brazil. Then, alpha-spectrometry after several radiochemical steps was used at the Applied Nuclear Physics Laboratories, University of Seville, Seville, Spain, for measuring the activity concentration of the radionuclides. It was 210Po the radionuclide that most bio-accumulates in the organisms, reaching the highest levels in mosses. The ferns species were less sensitive as bio-monitor than the mosses and lichens, considering polonium in relation to other radionuclides. Fruticose lichens exhibited lower polonium content than the foliose lichens sampled in the same site. Besides biological features, environmental characteristics also modify the radio-elements absorption by lichens and mosses like the type of vegetation covering these organisms, their substrate, the prevailing wind direction, elevation and climatic conditions. Only 210Po and 238U correlated in ferns and in soil and rock materials, being particulate emissions from the coal-fired power plant the most probable U-source in the region.

A questionnaire with a 3-point scale and 5-point scale was used to gather data on the respondents’ study habits and attitude towards science respectively and test was administered to measure their level of readiness. Spearman’s rho and Kendall’s tau were used to determine the relationship between the respondents’ study habits, attitudes, and level of readiness. The findings revealed that the respondents do not devote enough time to their studies and seldom have proper study habits. On the other hand, the students have positive attitudes towards science which mean that they like the subject. The respondents have limited readiness in chemistry and physics while they have good readiness in environmental science. Furthermore, no significant relationship exists between the respondents’ study habits, attitudes, and level of readiness.

Ocean observatories are collections of platforms capable of carrying sensors to sample the ocean over appropriate spatiotemporal scales. Data collected by these platforms help answer a range of fundamental and applied research questions. Many countries are spending considerable amount of resources on ocean observing programs for various purposes. Given the huge volume, diverse types, sustained measurement, and potential uses of ocean observing data, it is a typical kind of big data, namely marine big data. The traditional data-centric infrastructure is insufficient to deal with new challenges arising in ocean science. New distributed, large-scale modern infrastructure backbone is urgently required. This paper discusses some possible strategies to solve marine big data challenges in the phases of data storage, data computing, and analysis.

Additionally, calculations show these half-metallic alloys obey a Slater–Pauling rule between total magnetic moment and valence electrons.

Constrained by the scarce visible optical modulators, the solid-state ultrafast visible lasers are rarely realized. Based on the bandgap structure and optoelectronic properties of atomic-layer MoS2, it can be proposed that MoS2 has the potential as a visible optical modulator. Here, by originally revealing layer-dependent nonlinear absorption of the atomic-layer MoS2 in the visible range, broadband atomic-layer MoS2 optical modulators for the visible ultrafast pulse generation are developed and selected based on the proposed design criteria for novel two-dimensional (2D) optical modulators. By applying the selected MoS2 optical modulators in the solid-state praseodymium lasers, broadband mode-locked ultrafast lasers from 522 to 639 nm are originally realized.

The growing of relevance of a:C-H is mainly due to the long-term stability of their outstanding properties. For improving their performances, a full understanding of their local chemistry is highly required. Fifteen years ago, electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), developed in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), was the technique of choice to extract such kind of quantitative information on these materials. Other optical techniques, as Raman spectroscopy, are now clearly favored by the scientific community. However, they still lack of the spatial resolution offered by TEM-EELS. In addition, nowadays, the complexity of the physics phenomena behind EELS is better known. Here, a:C-H thin films have been isothermally annealed and the evolution of their physical and chemical parameters have been monitored at the local and macroscopic scales. In particular, chemical in-depth inhomogeneities and their origins are highlighted. Furthermore, a novel procedure to extract properly and reliably quantitative chemical information from EEL spectra is presented. Finally, the pertinence of empirical models used by the Raman community is discussed.

The genes encode the protein expression that eventually drives the emergence of the phenotype, while energy supply and cell-to-cell communication mechanisms are necessary to such a process. The overall control of the system likely exploits the laws of chemistry and physics through robust and universal processes. Even if the identification of the communication mechanisms is a question of fundamental nature, a long-standing investigation settled in the realm of chemical factors only (also known as morphogens) faces a number of apparently unsolvable questions. In this paper, we investigate at what extent mechanical forces, alone or through their biological feedbacks, can direct some basic aspects of morphogenesis in development biology. In this branch of mechano-biology, we discuss the typical rheological regimes of soft living matter and the related forces, providing a survey on how local mechanical feedbacks can control global size or even gene expression. We finally highlight the pivotal role of nonlinear mechanics to explain the emergence of complex shapes in living matter. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Developmental biology; Elasticity; Mechanobiology; Morphogenesis","Biology; Elasticity; Gene expression; Genes; Morphology; Surveys; Cell-to-cell communication; Communication mechanisms; Developmental biology; Initial conditions; Mechano-biology; Morphogenesis; Nonlinear mechanics; Protein expressions; Process control"

We present here a method to determine experimentally the amplitude of surface acoustic waves propagating on Gallium Arsenide generated by an interdigitated transducer.

However, the dependence of these functionalities on shapes, sizes, orientation and mutual arrangement of ferroelectric particles is currently not fully understood. In this study, we utilize a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau approach combined with coupled-physics finite-element-method based simulations to elucidate the behavior of polarization in isolated spherical PbTiO3 or BaTiO3 nanoparticles embedded in a dielectric medium, including air. The equilibrium polarization topology is strongly affected by particle diameter, as well as the choice of inclusion and matrix materials, with monodomain, vortex-like and multidomain patterns emerging for various combinations of size and materials parameters. This leads to radically different polarization vs. electric field responses, resulting in highly tunable size-dependent dielectric properties that should be possible to observe experimentally. Our calculations show that there is a critical particle size below which ferroelectricity vanishes. For the PbTiO3 particle, this size is 2 and 3.4 nm, respectively, for high- and low-permittivity media. For the BaTiO3 particle, it is ∼3.6 nm regardless of the medium dielectric strength. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Barium compounds; Dielectric materials; Dielectric properties; Electric fields; Energy harvesting; Ferroelectric materials; Ferroelectricity; Nanoparticles; Particle size; Polarization; Topology; Critical particle size; Electric field response; Energy harvesting device; Equilibrium polarization; Finite element method based simulation; Functional properties; Intrinsic size effects; Materials parameters; Finite element method"

The growth mechanism of β-FeSe superconductors is discussed by kinetically controllable syntheses in various reaction conditions. Chemically engineering the stoichiometry of β-FeSe products by selenium-diffusion process gives rise to a transition of antiferromagnetic-superconducting-antiferromagnetic (AFM-SC-AFM) order. Once the AFM order is suppressed, SC β-FeSe nanosheets show a tunable initial superconducting transition temperature (TC) from 3.2 to 10 K in the superconducting regime. Electrical measurements on superconducting β-FeSe exhibit an upper critical magnetic field higher than 14 T, showing potential application of β-FeSe nanosheet for superconducting device.

These apertures are formed by fusion of the basal and apical membranes into a tunnel that spans the height of the cell. Subsequent to the aperture formation, an active repair process, driven by a stimulated polymerization of actin, results in asymmetrical membrane protrusions and, ultimately, the closure of the aperture. Here, we propose a physics-based model for the generation, stabilization and repair of trans-endothelial apertures. Our model is based on the mechanical interplay between tension in the plasma membrane and stresses that develop within different actin structures at the aperture's periphery. We suggest that accumulation of cytoskeletal fragments around the aperture's rim during the expansion phase results in parallel bundles of actin filaments and myosin motors, generating progressively greater contraction forces that resist further expansion of the aperture. Our results indicate that closure of the tunnel is driven by mechanical stresses that develop within a cross-linked actin gel that forms at localized regions of the aperture periphery. We show that stresses within the gel are due to continuous polymerization of actin filaments against the membrane surfaces of the aperture's edges. Based on our mechanical model, we construct a dynamic simulation of the aperture repair process. Our model fully accounts for the phenomenology of the trans-endothelial aperture formation and stabilization, and recaptures the experimentally observed asymmetry of the intermediate aperture shapes during closure. We make experimentally testable predictions for localization of myosin motors to the tunnel periphery and of adhesion complexes to the edges of apertures undergoing closure, and we estimate the minimal nucleation size of cross-linked actin gel that can lead to a successful repair of the aperture. © 2017 Biophysical Society",,"actin; myosin adenosine triphosphatase; biological model; biomechanics; chemistry; cytology; endothelium cell; human; mechanical stress; mechanics; metabolism; protein multimerization; protein quaternary structure; Actins; Actomyosin; Biomechanical Phenomena; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Mechanical Phenomena; Models, Biological; Protein Multimerization; Protein Structure, Quaternary; Stress, Mechanical"

Conducting probe atomic force microscopy revealed that the low bias resistance of the chains increased upon substitution in the order CH2 &lt; O &lt; S. This change in resistance is ascribed to the observed identical trend in contact resistance, Rc, whereas the exponential prefactor β (length sensitivity) was essentially the same for all chains. Using an established, analytical single-level model, we computed the effective energy offset μh (i.e., Fermi level relative to the effective HOMO level) and the electronic coupling strength γ from the current-voltage (I-V) data. The μh values were only weakly affected by heteroatom substitution, whereas the interface coupling strength γ varied by over an order of magnitude. Consequently, we ascribe the strong variation in Rc to the systematic change in γ. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that the HOMO density shifts from the terminal SH groups for the alkanedithiols to the heteroatoms in the substituted chains, which provides a plausible explanation for the marked decrease in γ for the dithiols with electron-rich heteroatoms. The results indicate that the electronic coupling and thus the resistance of alkanedithiols can be tuned by substitution of even a single atom in the middle of the molecule. Importantly, when appropriately normalized, the experimental I-V curves were accurately simulated over the full bias range (±1.5 V) using the single-level model with no adjustable parameters. The data could be collapsed to a single universal curve predicted by the model, providing clear evidence that the essential physics is captured by this analytical approach and supporting its utility for molecular electronics. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","electronic coupling; heteroatom substitution; molecular tunnel junctions; quantum chemical calculations; single-level model; transition voltage; universal behavior out of equilibrium","Atomic force microscopy; Bias voltage; Chains; Quantum chemistry; Electronic coupling; Heteroatom substitution; Out of equilibrium; Quantum chemical calculations; Single-level models; Transition voltage; Tunnel junctions"

The critical value of WFI energy that separates these regimes increases with temperature, but it remains unaffected by the driving force. The mechanism of slip was analyzed by examining the density-weighted average energy barrier (ΔE¯) encountered by fluid atoms in the first fluid layer (FFL) during their hopping between minima of the surface potential. We demonstrated that the relationship between slip and WFI can be rationalized by considering the effect of the fluid density distribution in the FFL on ΔE¯ as a function of the WFI energy. Moreover, the dependence of the slip length on WFI and temperature is well correlated with the exponential factor exp(−ΔE¯/(kBT)), which also determines the critical value of WFI between the strong-WFI and weak-WFI regimes. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Physical chemistry; Physics; Atomically smooth surface; Critical value; Density weighted averages; Driving forces; Exponential factors; Fluid density distribution; Fluid interactions; nocv1; Non equilibrium molecular dynamic (NEMD); Molecular dynamics"

Both 0-0 and vertical transition energies are considered and compared to the experimental values. All approaches reasonably reproduce the auxochromic and acidochromic shifts, although in most cases both TD-DFT and BSE/GW return larger correlation with experimental values than ADC(2) for these shifts. In contrast, the absolute transition energies obtained with ADC(2) tend to be closer to the measurements, TD-DFT using the M06-2X functional largely overestimating the experimental references (by ca. 0.5 eV), and BSE/GW providing intermediate values.

Rapid and accurate prediction of their extended substrate specificity would also aid in the design of custom proteases capable of selectively and controllably cleaving biotechnologically or therapeutically relevant targets. However, current in silico approaches for protease specificity prediction, rely on, and are therefore limited by, machine learning of sequence patterns in known experimental data. Here, we describe a general approach for predicting peptidase substrates de novo using protein structure modeling and biophysical evaluation of enzyme–substrate complexes. We construct atomic resolution models of thousands of candidate substrate–enzyme complexes for each of five model proteases belonging to the four major protease mechanistic classes—serine, cysteine, aspartyl, and metallo-proteases—and develop a discriminatory scoring function using enzyme design modules from Rosetta and AMBER's MMPBSA. We rank putative substrates based on calculated interaction energy with a modeled near-attack conformation of the enzyme active site. We show that the energetic patterns obtained from these simulations can be used to robustly rank and classify known cleaved and uncleaved peptides and that these structural-energetic patterns have greater discriminatory power compared to purely sequence-based statistical inference. Combining sequence and energetic patterns using machine-learning algorithms further improves classification performance, and analysis of structural models provides physical insight into the structural basis for the observed specificities. We further tested the predictive capability of the model by designing and experimentally characterizing the cleavage of four novel substrate motifs for the hepatitis C virus NS3/4 protease using an in vivo assay. The presented structure-based approach is generalizable to other protease enzymes with known or modeled structures, and complements existing experimental methods for specificity determination. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","computational modeling; proteases; Rosetta software; specificity prediction; substrate specificity","aspartic acid; cysteine; hepacivirin; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase; metalloproteinase; multienzyme complex; nonstructural protein 4A; nonstructural protein 4B; peptidase; proteinase; serine; protein; proteinase; TEV protease; amino acid sequence; Article; complex formation; enzyme active site; enzyme analysis; enzyme conformation; enzyme specificity; enzyme substrate; Hepatitis C virus; in vivo study; machine learning; molecular dynamics; molecular physics; nonhuman; priority journal; process optimization; protein cleavage; protein function; protein interaction; protein motif; protein secondary structure; structural model; algorithm; biology; chemistry; computer simulation; enzyme specificity; reproducibility; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Catalytic Domain; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Endopeptidases; Proteins; Reproducibility of Results; Substrate Specificity"

The addition of exothermicity through a myriad of chemical reactions in fluid turbulence renders turbulent combustion a formidable challenge alongside its ubiquity in all chemical to mechanical energy conversion devices. Here, we review some recent advancements in theory, experiments, and computations of turbulent premixed combustion through two ostensibly decoupled: global and local viewpoints. Global viewpoints are essential to obtain useful statistics of turbulent flame propagation such as turbulent flame speed. Local viewpoints are crucial towards understanding detailed phenomena such as how local flame elements are stretched or annihilated. These fine grained understandings must culminate towards various sub-models of a successful global model. Essential features of recent theoretical developments towards turbulent flame speed using the level set formulation are reviewed here. The theoretical turbulent flame speed is shown to conform to the experimental expanding flame measurements over a wide range of fuels, pressure and turbulence intensity. Finally, recent advances to track flame elements and their local properties from detailed chemistry direct numerical simulations, are reviewed through a Lagrangian viewpoint. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",,

Specifically, we consider the range-separated hybrid (RSH) method which combines long-range Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange with a short-range semilocal exchange-correlation density functional, and the RSH+MP2 method which adds long-range, second-order Møller-Plesset (MP2) correlation. Results on atoms and molecules show that the fractional-charge errors obtained in RSH are much smaller than in the standard Kohn-Sham (KS) scheme applied with semilocal or hybrid approximations, and also generally smaller than in the standard HF method. The RSH+MP2 method tends to have smaller fractional-charge errors than standard MP2 for the most diffuse systems, but larger fractional-charge errors for the more compact systems. Even though the individual contributions to the fractional-spin errors in the H atom coming from the short-range exchange and correlation density-functional approximations are smaller than the corresponding contributions for the full-range exchange and correlation density-functional approximations, RSH gives fractional-spin errors that are larger than in the standard KS scheme and only slightly smaller than in standard HF. Adding long-range MP2 correlation only leads to infinite fractional-spin errors.

Recent advances in automated reaction path search methods have enabled efficient construction of the rate equations based on quantum chemical calculations. However, it is still difficult to solve the rate equations composed of hundreds or more elementary steps. This problem is especially serious when elementary steps that occur in highly different timescales coexist. In this article, we introduce an efficient approach to obtain the branching ratio from a given set of rate equations. It has been derived from a recently proposed rate constant matrix contraction (RCMC) method, and termed full-RCMC (f-RCMC). The f-RCMC gives the branching ratio without solving the rate equations. Its performance was tested numerically for unimolecular decomposition of C3H5 and C4H5. Branching ratios obtained by the f-RCMC precisely reproduced the values obtained by numerically solving the rate equations. It took about 95 h to solve the rate equations of C4H5 consisting of 234 elementary steps. In contrast, the f-RCMC gave the branching ratio in less than 1 s. The f-RCMC would thus be an efficient alternative of the conventional kinetic simulation approach. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","branching ratio; kinetic simulation; rate constant matrix contraction; rate equation; unimolecular decomposition","Decomposition; Plasma simulation; Quantum chemistry; Rate constants; Branching ratio; Constant matrix; Kinetic simulation; Rate equations; Unimolecular decompositions; High energy physics"

In this work, we systematically vary the underlying SCF approaches, that is, based on HF or density functional theory, to identify best suited reference orbitals using a series of small test molecules. We compare the energies of the K edges and NEXAFS spectra to experimental data. The main improvement compared to conventional CIS, that is, using HF ground state orbitals, is due to the electrostatic influence of the core hole. Different SCF approaches, density functionals, or the use of fractional occupations lead only to comparably small changes. Furthermore, to account for bigger systems, we adapt the core-valence separation for our approach. We demonstrate that the good quality of the spectrum is not influenced by this approximation when used together with the non-separated ground state wave function.

We systematically explored the properties of the multiphase samples to disclose their structure and chemical composition features using a series of techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The Rietveld approach based on structure and microstructure refinement analysis was adopted for precise determination of several microstructural parameters as well as phase contents of individual phases in the multiphase materials. The X-ray diffraction results confirms that the samples are multiphase and crystallize in the monoclinic baddeleyite structure with P 1 21/c 1 space group, orthorhombic mullite structure with P b a m space group, and cubic molybdenum structure with I m –3 m space group, respectively. The morphology features of the samples were observed by using scanning electron microscopy. The actual elemental distributions can be easily observed in energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry elemental mappings. To shed more light on the properties of the multiphase powder mixtures, their physical features (e.g., dislocation density, unit cell volume, X-ray density, porosity) were researched in detail.

Quantum chemistry packages enable calculation of complex potential energy surfaces (CPESs). The imaginary part of the CPES is associated with the autoionization decay rate, which is a function of the molecular structure. Molecular dynamics simulations, within the framework of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, require the definition of a force field. The ability to calculate the forces on the nuclei in bio-systems when autoionization takes place seems to rely on an understanding of radiative damages in RNA and DNA arising from the release of slow moving electrons which have long de Broglie wavelengths. This work addresses calculation of the real forces on the nuclei moving on the CPES. By using the transformation of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, previously used by Madelung, we proved that the classical forces on nuclei moving on the CPES correlated with the gradient of the real part of the CPES. It was proved that the force on the nuclei of the metastable molecules is time independent although the probability to detect metastable molecules exponentially decays. The classical force is obtained from the transformed Schrödinger equation when ℏ=0 and the Schrödinger equation is reduced to the classical (Newtonian) equations of motion. The forces on the nuclei regardless on what potential energy surface they move (parent CPES or product real PESs) vary in time due to the autoionization process. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Biochemistry; Equations of motion; Molecular dynamics; Molecular physics; Molecules; Nucleic acids; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Rate constants; Autoionization decay; Autoionization process; Born-Oppenheimer approximation; De Broglie wavelength; Exponentially decays; Metastable molecules; Molecular dynamics simulations; Molecular potential energies; Potential energy"

Meng et al., J. Chem. Phys. 144, 154312 (2016)]. For H + Et, one of the H atoms in CH4 of the parent system is replaced by a methyl group, while for the H + DME reaction, it is replaced by the methoxyl group. For the H + Pr reaction, replacing one of the H atoms in CH4 by an ethyl group, the terminal channel is built, meanwhile the middle channel is considered through replacing two H atoms in CH4 by two methyl groups. Since the potential energy barriers of the title reactions must differ from the H + CH4 barrier, the corrections have to be made by computing the ratio of free-energy barriers between H + CH4 and the title reactions at coupled cluster with a full treatment singles and doubles (where the triples contribution is calculated by perturbation theory, that is, CCSD(T)) level. Comparing the present RPMD rates with the previous theoretical and experimental results, good agreement can be found. Moreover, probable reasons for the deviation between the present RPMD rates and the previous experimental ones are discussed. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Abstracting; Atoms; Cluster computing; Computation theory; Energy barriers; Ethane; Ethers; Free energy; Fuels; Molecular dynamics; Molecular physics; Numerical methods; Perturbation techniques; Potential energy; Propane; Quantum chemistry; Abstraction channels; Coupled clusters; Dimethyl ethers; Invariant polynomials; Local permutations; Methoxyl groups; Perturbation theory; Rate coefficients; Reaction kinetics"

In particular, rapidly expanding photon-science facilities like X-ray free-electron lasers and intense laser beamlines require system-wide attosecond-level synchronization of dozens of optical and microwave signals up to kilometer distances. Once equipped with such precision, these facilities will initiate radically new science by shedding light on molecular and atomic processes happening on the attosecond timescale, such as intramolecular charge transfer, Auger processes and their impacts on X-ray imaging.

In both cases, physics regarding shock compressibility, thresholds for the on-set of shock-driven ionization, and even dissociation chemistry are difficult to infer for gases at intermediate densities. We have developed an experimental target design for gas gun-driven plate impact experiments on noble gases at initial pressures between 200-1000 psi. Using optical velocimetry, we are able to directly determine both the shock and particle velocities of the gas on the principal Hugoniot locus, as well as clearly differentiate ionization thresholds. The target design also results in multiply shocking the gas in a quasi-isentropic fashion yielding off-Hugoniot compression data.

New additive manufacturing techniques offer unprecedented control of explosive microstructures previously impossible, enabling us to develop novel explosives with tailored shock sensitivity and detonation properties. Since microstructureperformance relationships are not well established for explosives, there is little material design guidance for these manufacturing techniques. In this study, we explore the effects of high shock pressures (15-38 GPa) with long shock durations and different pore morphologies on hot spot mechanisms in HMX. HMX is chosen as the model material because we have experimental data on many of the chemical-thermal-mechanical properties required for pore collapse simulations. Our simulations are performed using the multi-physics arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian finite element hydrocode, ALE3D, with Cheetah-based models for the unreacted and the product equation-of-states. We use a temperature-dependent specific heat with the unreacted equation-of-state and a temperature-dependent viscosity model to ensure accurate shock temperatures for subsequent chemistry. The Lindemann Law model is used for shock melting in HMX. In contrast to previous pore collapse studies at lower shock pressures (≤10 GPa) in HMX and shorter post-collapse burning times, our calculations show that shock melting occurs above 15 GPa due to higher bulk heating and a prominent elongated (""jet-like"") hot spot region forms at later times. The combination of the elongated, post-collapse hot spot region and the higher bulk heating with increasing pressure dramatically increases the growth rate of reaction. Our calculations show that the reaction rate, dF=dt, increases with increasing shock pressure. We decompose the reaction rate into ignition ((dF=dt)ig) and growth ((dF=dt)gr) phases to better analyze our results. We define the ignition phase to primarily include pore collapse and growth phase to primarily include post-collapse grain burning. We are able to track late-time, post-collapse burning due to the unique loading conditions employed in these calculations. We find that (dF=dt)gr &gt; (dF=dt)ig for all pressures considered. (dF=dt)gr changes more significantly from 25 to 38 GPa (from 0.05/μs to &gt;10-100/μs) than from 15 to 25 GPa (from 0.005/μs to 0.05/μs). There is a three order-of-magnitude difference in the reaction from 15 to 38 GPa just after pore collapse. This is qualitatively consistent with fitting the (macroscopic) Ignition and Growth model to high pressure shock initiation data, where much larger reaction fractions are needed to capture the early stages of reaction. Calculated burn rates demonstrate better agreement with data at intermediate times in the growth phase for 15 to 25 GPa and late times for 30 GPa then at any time in the growth phase for 38 GPa. Our calculations are much higher than burn rate data at the earliest times in the growth phase for all pressures, which may reflect the higher localized pressures and temperatures just after pore collapse in the ignition phase. Our calculations with spherical, conical, and elliptical pores show that the influence of morphology on reaction rate is pressure dependent and the most influential pore shapes at lower pressures aren't the same at higher pressures in the regime studied. Altogether these studies provide the basis for developing microstructure-aware models that can be used to design new explosives with optimal performance-safety characteristics. Such models can be used to guide additive manufacturing of explosives and fully exploit their disruptive nature.",,

Consideration of all the interactions at play in sulfur-protected gold surfaces and gold nanoparticles is necessary to understand their structural, chemical and spectroscopic properties.

The number of calculations required for chemical accuracy is still prohibitively expensive for the ab initio MBE to compete with force field approximations for applications beyond single-point energies. Alongside the MBE, empirical models of ab initio potential energy surfaces have improved, especially non-linear models based on neural networks (NNs) which can reproduce ab initio potential energy surfaces rapidly and accurately. Although they are fast, NNs suffer from their own curse of dimensionality; they must be trained on a representative sample of chemical space. In this paper we examine the synergy of the MBE and NN’s and explore their complementarity. The MBE offers a systematic way to treat systems of arbitrary size while reducing the scaling problem of large systems. NN’s reduce, by a factor in excess of 106, the computational overhead of the MBE and reproduce the accuracy of ab initio calculations without specialized force fields. We show that for a small molecule extended system like methanol, accuracy can be achieved with drastically different chemical embeddings. To assess this we test a new chemical embedding which can be inverted to predict molecules with desired properties.

These two energetic molecules, subsequent to UV excitation, create NO as an initial decomposition product at the nanosecond excitation energies (5.0-5.5 eV) with warm vibrational temperature (1170 ± 50 K for A, 1400 ± 50 K for B) and cold rotational temperature (&lt;55 K). Initial decomposition mechanisms for these two electronically excited, isolated molecules are explored at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF(12,12)/6-31G(d)) level with and without MP2 correction. Potential energy surface calculations illustrate that conical intersections play an essential role in the calculated decomposition mechanisms. Based on experimental observations and theoretical calculations, NO product is released through opening of the furoxan ring: ring opening can occur either on the S1 excited or S0 ground electronic state. The reaction path with the lowest energetic barrier is that for which the furoxan ring opens on the S1 state via the breaking of the N1 - O1 bond. Subsequently, the molecule moves to the ground S0 state through related ring-opening conical intersections, and an NO product is formed on the ground state surface with little rotational excitation at the last NO dissociation step. For the ground state ring opening decomposition mechanism, the N - O bond and C - N bond break together in order to generate dissociated NO. With the MP2 correction for the CASSCF(12,12) surface, the potential energies of molecules with dissociated NO product are in the range from 2.04 to 3.14 eV, close to the theoretical result for the density functional theory (B3LYP) and MP2 methods. The CASMP2(12,12) corrected approach is essential in order to obtain a reasonable potential energy surface that corresponds to the observed decomposition behavior of these molecules. Apparently, highly excited states are essential for an accurate representation of the kinetics and dynamics of excited state decomposition of both of these bisfuroxan energetic molecules. The experimental vibrational temperatures of NO products of A and B are about 800-1000 K lower than previously studied energetic molecules with NO as a decomposition product. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Decomposition; Density functional theory; Ground state; Hydrogen bonds; Large scale systems; Laser excitation; Molecular physics; Molecules; Particle beams; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Complete active space self consistent fields; Decomposition behaviors; Decomposition mechanism; Ground electronic state; Initial decomposition products; Theoretical calculations; Unimolecular decompositions; Vibrational temperature; Excited states"

The model performances in reproducing the atmospheric desert dust load were evaluated using a multi-platform observational dataset of aerosol and desert dust properties, including optical properties from satellite and ground-based sun photometers and lidars, plus in situ particulate matter mass concentration (PM) data.

Cross-analysis of the modeled AOD and desert dust emission fluxes further allowed for the source regions of the observed plumes to be inferred. The vertical displacement of the modeled dust plume was in rather good agreement with the lidar soundings, with correlation coefficients among aerosol extinction profiles up to 1 and mean discrepancy of about 50%. The model-measurement comparison for PM10 and PM2.5 showed a good temporal matching, although it revealed a marked overestimation of PM10 and PM2.5 (of the order of 70% during the dust peak). For PM10, it was also possible to investigate the accordance between the model-and the measurement-based dust PM10, this confirming the model PM10 overestimation to be related to over-predicted dust mass up to a factor of 140%.

Degradation of profenofos was followed with ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and follows pseudo first-order kinetic. Accordingly, high-field FTICR mass spectrometry coupled to an electrospray ionization source was used to reveal the degradation routes of profenofos and the isotopic fine structures (IFS) elucidations to approve the chemical structures of its degradation products. More degradation products were detected in UPW as compared to RW. Consequently, two main degradation pathways namely (i) interactive replacements of bromine and hydrogen by hydroxyl functional groups and (ii) rupture of PO, PS, CBr and CCl bonds were observed. None interactive replacement of chlorine by hydroxyl functional group was detected. Accordingly, mechanistical pathways of the main degradation products were established. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","degradation products; FTICR MS; IFS; Profenofos","Atomic physics; Chromatography; Electrospray ionization; Hydrogen bonds; Isotopes; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Spectrometry; Degradation pathways; Degradation products; FT-ICR mass spectrometry; FT-ICR MS; Profenofos; Pseudo-first order kinetics; Simulated sunlight; Ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC); Degradation; chemical analysis; degradation; identification method; irradiation; isotopic analysis; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; profenofos; reaction kinetics; Thailand; insecticide; phosphorothioic acid derivative; profenofos; titanium; titanium dioxide; water pollutant; analysis; chemistry; kinetics; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; metabolism; pH; photolysis; procedures; sunlight; Thailand; water pollutant; Chromatography, Liquid; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Insecticides; Kinetics; Mass Spectrometry; Organothiophosphates; Photolysis; Sunlight; Thailand; Titanium; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

This is a growing area of neutron science, capitalising upon the unique insights provided by epithermal neutrons on the behaviour and properties of an increasing number of complex materials. As such, the present work builds upon the aims and scope of a previous contribution to this journal back in 2005, whose primary focus was on a detailed description of the theoretical foundations of the technique and their application to fundamental systems [see Andreani et al., Adv. Phys. 54 (2005) p.377] A lot has happened since then, and this review intends to capture such progress in the field. With both expert and novice in mind, we start by presenting the general principles underpinning the technique and discuss recent conceptual and methodological developments. We emphasise the increasing use of the technique as a non-invasive spectroscopic probe with intrinsic mass selectivity, as well as the concurrent use of neutron diffraction and first-principles computational materials modelling to guide and interpret experiments. To illustrate the state of the art, we discuss in detail a number of recent exemplars, chosen to highlight the use of electron-volt neutron spectroscopy across physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science. These include: hydrides and proton conductors for energy applications; protons, deuterons, and oxygen atoms in bulk water; aqueous protons confined in nanoporous silicas, carbon nanotubes, and graphene-related materials; hydrated water in proteins and DNA; and the uptake of molecular hydrogen by soft nanostructured media, promising materials for energy-storage applications. For the primary benefit of the novice, this last case study is presented in a pedagogical and question-driven fashion, in the hope that it will stimulate further work into uncharted territory by newcomers to the field. All along, we emphasise the increasing (and much-needed) synergy between experiments using electron-volt neutrons and contemporary condensed matter theory and materials modelling to compute and ultimately understand neutron-scattering observables, as well as their relation to materials properties not amenable to scrutiny using other experimental probes. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","deep-inelastic neutron scattering; electron-volt neutron spectroscopy; hydrogen storage; mass-selective neutron spectroscopy; neutron Compton scattering; neutron diffraction; nuclear momentum distribution; nuclear quantum effects; proton conductors; water and aqueous media","Carbon; Computation theory; Condensed matter physics; Deuterium; Electrons; Hydrogen storage; Molecular oxygen; Neutron diffraction; Neutron scattering; Neutron spectrometers; Probes; Quantum electronics; Quantum theory; Yarn; Aqueous media; Deep inelastic neutron scattering; Momentum distributions; Neutron Compton scattering; Neutron spectroscopy; Nuclear quantum effects; Proton conductors; Materials properties"

At present, two XFEL facilities, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and SPring-8 Angstrom Compact free electron LAser (SACLA), offer research opportunities to scientists from various fields. The novel characteristics of XFELs necessitate new experimental styles, which are very different from those for conventional X-ray sources. Since many users were not familiar with these new styles in the early stage of scientific applications, user-friendly experimental systems were necessary to boost the XFEL applications into a state of practical use. XFELs are now producing unique results in, for example, structural biology [3–6], nonlinear X-ray optics [7, 8], ultrafast physics and chemistry [9–11], and high-energy-density science [12]. ©, Copyright Taylor & Francis.",,

MERs therefore play a twofold constitutive role in reasoning in these domains. Firstly, MERs stand in for the phenomena and entities that are imagined, and thus make possible scientific investigations. Secondly, related to the above, sensorimotor and imagination-based interactions with the MERs make possible focused cognitive operations involving these phenomena and entities, such as mental rotation and analogical transformations. These two constitutive roles suggest that acquiring expertise in science, mathematics and engineering requires developing the ability to transform and integrate the MERs in that field, in tandem with running operations in imagination on the phenomena and entities the MERs stand for. This core ability to integrate external and internal representations and operations on them–termed representational competence (RC)–is therefore critical to learning in science, mathematics and engineering. However, no general account of this core process is currently available. We argue that, given the above two constitutive roles played by MERs, a theoretical account of representational competence requires an explicit model of how the cognitive system interacts with external representations, and how imagination abilities develop through this process. At the applied level, this account is required to develop design guidelines for new media interventions for learning science and mathematics, particularly emerging ones that are based on embodied interactions. As a first step to developing such a theoretical account, we review the literature on learning with MERs, as well as acquiring RC, in chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics and engineering, from two perspectives. First, we focus on the important theoretical accounts and related empirical studies, and examine what is common about them. Second, we summarise the major trends in each discipline, and then bring together these trends. The results show that most models and empirical studies of RC are framed within the classical information processing approach, and do not take a constitutive view of external representations. To develop an account compatible with the constitutive view of external representations, we outline an interaction-based theoretical account of RC, extending recent advances in distributed and embodied cognition. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","distributed cognition; embodied cognition; MER integration; Multiple external representations (MER); new media; representational competence (RC)",

In particular, a concept of “diffraction before destruction” [3] has been demonstrated for serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) [4, 5] and coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) [6]. Using femto-second XFEL pulses, diffraction data are collected before radiation damage to samples has time to occur. Since samples are exchanged for each XFEL pulse, shot-to-shot data acquisition (DAQ) is mandatory to correlate the recorded data with the sample characteristics. The shot-to-shot DAQ must be synchronized with the repetition rate of the XFEL source, typically several tens to one hundred Hz for the machine based on normal-conducting accelerators. Shot-to-shot recording of XFEL pulse characteristics is also essential because they fluctuate due to the stochastic nature of a self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE). We must carefully analyze a huge data set taking the fluctuation into account. ©, Copyright Taylor & Francis.",,

These methods represent a very important group among the wide range of local correlation methods. Originally introduced by Stoll in 1992 for a treatment of bulk solids, their applicability has been successfully extended to molecular systems on high levels of theory over the last decade. The incremental CCSD(T) approach provides a significantly increased efficiency in combination with a negligible loss of accuracy, compared to standard calculations. Furthermore, due to the reduced scaling with respect to the number of orbitals and the full parallelizability in terms of single increments, larger systems and basis sets are possible and a higher overall accuracy can be reached. Beside the highly accurate computation of absolute and various relative energies (cohesion, adsorption, weak interactions, chemical reactions), also other properties (lattice constants, bulk moduli, dipole moments, (hyper)polarizabilities) are obtainable. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.",,

The amended section is provided below: To further elaborate the sensing mechanism of the heterojunction, the surface band bending diagrams, involving the interface potential, are employed, as shown in Fig. 10. Commonly, the conductance of materials is dependent on carrier density and mobility, therefore, the conductance of NiO can be expressed as:48 (Formula Presented) where μ is the hole mobility, and q is the elementary electron charge, and p is the hole density. For the bare NiO, there is no contact potential because the Fermi level is kept always constant before or after the NiO nanosheets exposure to NO2 gas, so that the NO2 adsorption has little influence on the contact potential and the hole mobility. Therefore, the change in the conductance of the bare NiO is mainly dependent on the change in the surface accumulated hole density induced by NO2 adsorption. According to eqn (1), the sensitivity of the bare NiO can be expressed as: (Formula Presented) For a p-type semiconductor, the conduction process is mainly dominated by the surface hole accumulation layer component. And the hole density in the surface accumulation layer can be expressed as:50 (Formula Presented) where qVs is the surface band bending, pb is the hole concentration in bulk and ps is the hole density in the surface accumulation layer. Coming back to the relationship between the sensor signal and the surface band bending, as defined by eqn (3) and (4), one can obtain that: (Formula Presented) For the NiO-SnO2 nanocomposites, the situation is different. The interface potential is formed as a result of the differences in the Fermi level of the p-type NiO and the n-type SnO2, and the electron transfer from the SnO2 to NiO should overcome the interface (Figure Presented) potential. Therefore, the sensitivity of the NiO-SnO2 depends not only on the carrier density but also on the carrier mobility, and it can be expressed as: (Formula Presented) As the carrier mobility is dependent on the interface potential, the carrier mobility can be expressed as:49 (Figure Presented) where μ0 is the mobility without interface potential. And Vp-n is the interface potential, which is equal to the contact potential δ without surface states. It should be noted that the interface potential attenuates drift mobility of carriers and thus increase the resistance of the heterojunction nanocomposites, which is consistent with the former results of the largely decreased initial conductance of the NiO-SnO2. After exposure to NO2, the interface band bending aroused by the NO2 adsorption leads to the decrease of the interface potential. Therefore, from eqn (6) and (7), one obtains: (Formula Presented) Additionally, the carrier concentration of heterojunction nanocomposites is determined by the interface potential, and the carrier concentration of the nanocomposites can be expressed as: (Formula Presented) where Vs,p-n is the interface potential. Accordingly, the sensitivity of the NiO-SnO2 nanocomposites, as defined by eqn (8), can be further expressed as: (Formula Presented) Comparing eqn (5) with eqn (10), the sensitivity of the NiO-SnO2 heterojunction is characterized by two factors, involving the changes both in the carrier density and in the carrier mobility induced by NO2 adsorption, while the sensitivity of the bare NiO is only dependent on the changes in the surface band bending, as shown in Fig. 10. For the nanocomposites, the higher electron concentration in the SnO2 could attract NO2 gas more easily, and then more NO2 molecules adsorbed on the NiO-SnO2 nanocomposites, leading to the largely decreased interface potential of the heterojunction nanocomposites, as shown in Fig. 10. Therefore, the variation of the interface potential of nanocomposites induced by NO2 adsorption is larger than the changes in the surface band bending of bare NiO, leading to a more obvious decrease of the interface potential and a drastic effect on the transducer function for gas sensing. This means that NO2 adsorption affects the heterojunction conductance doubly, first through the carrier density term and second through the mobility term, enhancing the transducer function up to the square of that of the bare NiO. Therefore, the response of heterostructured NiO-SnO2 nanocomposites is largely enhanced at room temperature compared to the bare NiO.

In this paper, a multiferroic BiMnO3 nanowire array prepared by a hydrothermal method for light-controlled resistive switching memory is reported. The material phase identification was analyzed by the first author, Bai Sun, based on a previous report (ref. 21).1 However, the measured raw data were not exactly in agreement with ref. 21, the raw data displayed three additional small peaks. During analysis these peaks were incorrectly interpreted as the pattern of Ti substrate, and therefore were treated as part of the background and removed. The corresponding author was not made aware of these alterations. I have recently been made aware that the authors of ref. 21 have corrected their report to attribute their XRD patterns to BiOCl instead of BiMnO3. This cast doubt on our own interpretation and findings. Therefore my research group resynthesized our material according to our reported method and repeated the XRD analysis. The newly obtained XRD pattern is shown in Fig.1a (black line) and is consistent with the raw data collected in our original study (prior to peak removal). The asterisk labeled peak is attributed to the Ti substrate. The standard XRD patterns of BiMnO3 (JCPDS 89-4544) and BiOCl (JCPDS 82-0485) are also shown in blue and red, respectively. With the exception of the peaks at 30.35, 42.40 and 57.001, the measured peak positions and intensities in Fig. 1a agree well with those in PDF card 82-0485, and not with those in PDF-89-4544. We further characterized the composition by using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In Fig. 1b and c, C, Ti, Bi, Mn and O elements are identified. The Ti element is from the Ti substrate. The XPS spectrum of Cl2p in Fig. 1d shows a minor detected amount of Cl element, which we believe is attributed to the use of the chlorinated raw materials rather than the presence of BiOCl. The single crystalline feature shown in Fig. 2d of this PCCP paper suggests that the sample is not a composite of bismuth oxide and manganese oxide. However the elemental compositions tabulated in the inset of Fig. 1b in this notice are not consistent with non-stoichiometric BiMnO3. Although the evidence presented from the XPS and EDS analysis suggests that the material is not BiOCl, due to the indeterminate identity of 3 peaks in the XRD pattern we have found that there is insufficient evidence to conclusively state thatthe reported material is BiMnO3.

However the extension of synthesis conditions and the understanding of their impact on the silica matrix would widen the applicability of this process in terms of encapsulated organisms and the host properties. Here the influence of silicates and the colloidal silica concentration as well as pH conditions on the gel time, the optical properties, the structural and mechanical properties of silica matrices was studied. We show that gel formation is driven by silicate condensation but that the aggregation of silica colloids also has a major influence on the transparency and structure of the nanocomposites. Three different photosynthetic organisms, cyanobacteria Anabaena flos-aquae and two microalgae Chorella vulgaris and Euglena gracilis, were used as probes of the phycocompatibility of the process. The three organisms were highly sensitive to the silicate concentration, which impacts both the gelation time and ionic strength conditions. The Ludox content was crucial for cyanobacteria as it strongly impacts the Young's modulus of the matrices. The detrimental effect of acidic pH on cell suspension was compensated by the silica network. Overall, it is now possible to select optimal encapsulation conditions based on the physiology of the targeted cells, opening wide perspectives for the design of biosensors and bioreactors. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Biology; Biomechanics; Cell culture; Elastic moduli; Gelation; Hydrogels; Ionic strength; Nanocomposites; Optical properties; Silicates; Chorella vulgaris; Colloidal silica; Nanocomposite hydrogels; Photosynthetic organisms; Silica nanocomposites; Strength condition; Structural and mechanical properties; Synthesis conditions; Silica"

Marie Sklodowska Curie (1867-1934) suffered from radiations effects, as did girls in the radium dial watches factories. Therapeutic effects of radium were soon discovered, its unhealthy effects were as yet unheard of. Objectives: Analysis of Marie Sklodowska Curie (Marie) and radium girls occupational exposure, taking scientific debate on radium dangerous effects into account. Methods: analysis of occupational exposure and diseases of Marie and radium girls in major documents, including Curie archive letters. Results: Marie had dermatitis, radiodermatitis, tinnitus, one abortion, cataracts, tubercolosis, aplastic anemia. She also was a victim of mobbing. Women employed in the New Jersey radium dial watches factories, often immigrants, died of jaw necrosis, sarcoma of femur, anemia, leukemia and other radium related diseases. Marie was first asked about radium adverse effects by the New Jersey Department of labour (1925), Lise Meitner (1928) and the American Society for Cancer Control (1929). In 1928 Alice Hamilton organized a radium conference in order to find a solution to the radium girls' new disease. In 1929, during her second visit to the United States of America (USA), Marie declared how only prevention could save ""radium girls"". In 1934 she died of aplastic anemia, just like many radium girls. That year International Labour Office listed the new disease as due to ""radium, radioactive substances, X-rays""; it was followed in 1937 by five USA states. Conclusions: Unheard of knowledge, conflict of interest, scientific delay, incompetence and no prevention were yesterday, as they are today, the cause of many preventable women deaths.","Curie; Occupational disease; Prevention; Radium; Women",

Notable among the recently discovered exotic 2D materials are group IV elemental monolayers silicene and germanene, group V elemental monolayer phosphorene, and binary monolayers, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Environmental effect on the physical and chemical properties of these 2D materials is a fundamental issue for their practical applications in devices operating under ambient conditions, especially, exposure to air often leads to oxidation of nanomaterials with significant impact on the functional properties and performances of devices built with them. In view of its importance, we present here a review of the recent experimental and theoretical studies on the oxidation of 2D materials focusing on the relationship between the oxidation process and the energy values which can be calculated by first principles methods. The complement of experiments and theory facilitates the understanding of the underlying oxidation process in terms of cohesive energy, energy barrier to oxidation and dissociation energy of oxygen molecule for 2D materials including graphene, silicene, germanene, phosphorene, h-BN, and MoS2.

In the low energy spectrum of graphene near the charge neutrality point, where the linear carrier dispersion mimics the quasi-relativistic dispersion relation, pseudo spin replaces the role of real spin in the usual Dirac Fermion spectrum. The exotic quantum transport behavior discovered in graphene, such as the unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect and Klein tunneling effect, are a direct consequence of the pseudo spin rotation.

In this way, this paper aims to a statistical investigation about students' performances in Physics and in other disciplines. For this purpose, it was evaluated the correlations between student grades in Physics and in other curricula. In addition, it was developed a multilevel model with two hierarchical levels: the student and the classroom. In this model it was evaluated simultaneously the influence of some disciplines on the performance in Physics. Data used were obtained in two public schools from the cities of Ouro Preto and Campo Belo. It was tried to identify whether the performance in Mathematics and Natural Science, representing the logical and deductive reasoning, as well as the performance in Portuguese and Human Sciences, representing the ability of read and interpret, has some connection to the performance in Physics. The results have shown that the highest correlation values are found between the grades in Mathematics and Physics and between the average grades in Chemistry and Biology and the grades in Physics. Beyond that, when considering simultaneously the grades, it was found again that the proficiencies in Mathematics and Chemistry/Biology have a positive impact in Physics. The National Curriculum Parameters (PCN) aim to an integration of knowledge in theme, in which the Natural Sciences theme includs Physics, Chemistry and Biology.

The results could be summarized that the metamict zircon will be recrystallized to the crystalline zircon after thermal enhancement. The advantage of this study is about the identification of zircon before and after thermal enhancement. © 2017 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","FWHM; Heat treatment; Material physics and chemistry; Raman spectroscopy; Thermal enhancement; Zircon","Crystal structure; Full width at half maximum; Heat treatment; Radioactive elements; Raman spectroscopy; Thorium; Trace elements; Uranium; Vibration analysis; Zircon; Blue colors; High temperature; Material physics; Peak position; Reducing conditions; Thermal enhancement; Wave numbers; Zircon structure; Silicate minerals"

The ability to reliably predict the operating behaviors of SOFC stacks is crucial for the technology advancement. The existing stack models either rely on simplified geometries, or handle a few selected fields that are relatively easy to couple. This paper reports the first successful development of a high geometry resolution, multiphysics fully coupled numerical model for production scale planar SOFC stacks. The computational model is developed through in-house developed multiphysics modules combined with commercial software FLUENT®. All stack components such as flow channels, manifolds, cathode-electrolyte-anode assemblies, interconnects, seals and frames are resolved in the numerical grids. The mathematical model includes the fully coupled equations of momentum, mass, species, heat and charge transports, electrochemical reaction, and methane steam reforming and shift reactions. An accurate relationship between the O2transport and electrochemistry within the cathode-rib structure is established and used to enhance the numerical efficiency of the stack model. The stack model is validated with the experimental data. The numerical stability and modeling capability of this multiphysics stack model are illustrated by simulating a 30-cell stack of 27 million grid points. Detailed information about the distributions of flows, temperature, current and chemical species, etc, is revealed. Comparative studies show that the results obtained by simplifications of stack geometries or reductions of multiphysics couplings are unreliable, illustrating the necessity of employing a true multiphysics computational tool. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Computational fluid dynamics; Coupling algorithm; Multi-physics model; Numerical grids; Simulation strategy; User defined functions modules","Cathodes; Computational fluid dynamics; Computational methods; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Fuel cells; Geometry; Heating; Numerical models; Reforming reactions; Steam reforming; Coupling algorithms; Multi-physics modeling; Numerical grids; Simulation strategies; User Defined Functions; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); advanced technology; algorithm; computational fluid dynamics; design; electrochemistry; electrode; electrolyte; fuel cell; numerical model; power generation; software; speciation (chemistry)"

The geological origins of sapphire are related to either basaltic or metamorphic rocks. The causes of the color on sapphire are some trace elements such as Cr, Fe, and Ti. It could be mentioned that Ti atoms have cooperated with Fe atoms for creating the blue color. In this study, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) technique focused on the x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and the extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) is employed to identify the oxidation state of Ti atoms and Ti-O bond length on sapphire samples. The Ti K-edge XANES and EXAFS spectra of natural sapphires were carried out using the 13-channel array germanium detector in fluorescence mode. The XANES spectra showed that the oxidation state of Ti was Ti4+ regardless of Fe content. Moreover, the Ti-O bond length on α-Al2O3 was equal to the Ti-O bond length on rutile (TiO2) analyzed from the EXAFS spectra. From these results, it could be concluded that the oxidation state of Ti atoms on natural sapphires was Ti4+ which substitutes Al3+ on the sapphire structure. © 2017 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Material physics and chemistry; Sapphire; Synchrotron radiation; Ti-O bond length; Titanium oxidation state; X-ray absorption spectroscopy","Absorption spectra; Alumina; Atoms; Corundum; Extended X ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy; Metamorphic rocks; Oxidation; Oxide minerals; Sapphire; Synchrotron radiation; Titanium; Trace elements; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy; X ray absorption spectroscopy; Extended X-ray absorption fine structures; Fluorescence mode; Germanium detector; Material physics; Oxidation state; Ti-O bond length; Titanium oxidation state; X-ray absorption near-edge structure; Bond length"

It is thus reassuring to see how the application of rigorous chemical physics is leading to ingenious new solutions for both energy storage and harvesting, via, for example, nanoactuation, electrowetting, ionic materials and nanoplasmonics.

Recent progress shows that the power conversion efficiency of FASnI3 (FA = HC(NH2)2) solar cells prevails over that of MASnI3 (MA = CH3NH3). In this paper, we show that the organic cations, i.e., FA and MA, play a vital role in the defect properties of Sn halide perovskites. The antibonding coupling between Sn-5s and I-5p is clearly weaker in FASnI3 than in MASnI3 due to the larger ionic size of FA, leading to higher formation energies of Sn vacancies in FASnI3. Subsequently, the conductivity of FASnI3 can be tuned from p-type to intrinsic by varying the growth conditions of the perovskite semiconductor; in contrast, MASnI3 shows unipolar high p-type conductivity independent of the growth conditions. This provides a reasonable explanation for the better performance of FASnI3-based solar cells in experiments with respect to the MASnI3-based solar cells. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Defects; Lead; Perovskite; Positive ions; Semiconductor growth; Tin; Defect property; Formation energies; Growth conditions; Halide perovskites; Organic cations; P type conductivity; Power conversion efficiencies; Recent progress; Solar cells"

A two-dimensional self-consistent plasma model including the effect of detail air plasma chemistry and ultrafast gas heating is used in our studies. When a third electrode is placed downstream of a classical two-electrode nanosecond dialectric barrier discharge actuator and powered by a negative direct-current voltage, a coronalike discharge is formed in its immediately vicinity, which in turn changes the dynamic of the primary streamers propagating from the pulsed electrode. The primary streamer slides and can even extend to the entire interelectrode distance. The potential difference between the third electrode, the positively charged dielectric surface, and the virtual anode formed by the streamer itself is found to be the main reason behind this elongation because of the electric field enhancement at the streamer head. Preionization and charge accumulation from the third electrode also contribute to this behavior. The numerical results also indicate that for high electric fields a negative streamer can be produced at the third electrode that merges with the positive streamer from the pulsed electrode. Consequently, the plasma channel covers the entire interelectrode space. The elongation of the primary streamer leads to an increase of the effective energy release region, which can result in a more efficient flow actuation mechanism. ©2016 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Cosmic rays activate the rich chemistry that is observed in a molecular cloud and they also regulate its collapse timescale, determining the efficiency of star and planet formation, but they cannot penetrate up to the densest part of a molecular cloud, where the formation of stars is expected, because of energy loss processes and magnetic field deflections. Recently, observations towards young protostellar systems showed a surprisingly high value of the ionisation rate, the main indicator of the presence of cosmic rays in molecular cloud. Synchrotron emission, the typical feature of relativistic electrons, has also been detected towards the bow shock of a T Tauri star. Nevertheless, the origin of these signatures peculiar to accelerated particles is still puzzling. Here we show that particle acceleration can be driven by shock waves occurring in protostars through the first-order Fermi acceleration mechanism. We expect that shocks in protostellar jets can be efficient accelerators of protons, which can be boosted up to mildly relativistic energies. A strong acceleration can also take place at the protostellar surface, where shocks produced by infalling material during the phase of collapse are powerful enough to accelerate protons. Our model shows that thermal particles can experience an acceleration during the first phases of a system similar to the proto-Sun, and can also be used to explain recent observations. The presence of a local source of cosmic rays may have an unexpected impact over the process of the formation of stars and planets, as well as on the pre-biotic molecule formation. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","cosmic rays; interstellar medium: jets and outflows; stars: protostars","Acceleration; Clouds; Cosmology; Energy dissipation; Fighter aircraft; Particle accelerators; Shock waves; Stars; Accelerated particles; Galactic cosmic rays; Interstellar mediums; Jets and outflows; Particle acceleration; Relativistic electron; Stars: protostars; Synchrotron emission; Cosmic rays"

Four (three) normal modes with vibration frequency around 1550 cm−1 (1350 cm−1) related to ring wagging plus CC stretching and CH bend motions on the backbone are actually interpreted for solvent enhanced absorption (fluorescence) spectra of rubrene in benzene and cyclohexane solutions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Benzene; Chemical analysis; Cyclohexane; Excited states; Fluorescence; Light absorption; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Absorption and fluorescence spectra; Cyclohexane solutions; Damped oscillators; Enhanced absorption; Franck-Condon simulations; Quantum chemistry calculations; Second order transition; Vibration frequency; Solvents"

Calculated results show that all substituent can form halogen-bond complexes while part substituent can form pnicogen-bond complexes. Traditional, chlorine-shared and ion-pair halogen-bonds complexes have been found with the different substituent X and Y. The halogen-bonds are stronger than the related pnicogen-bonds. For halogen-bonds, strongly electronegative substituents which are connected to the Lewis acid can strengthen the bonds and significantly influenced the structures and properties of the compounds. In contrast, the substituents which connected to the Lewis bases can produce opposite effects. The interaction energies of halogen-bonds are 2.56 to 32.06 kcal·mol-1; The strongest halogen-bond was found in the complex of PH2OH•••BrF. The interaction energies of pnicogen-bonds are in the range 1.20 to 2.28 kcal·mol-1; the strongest pnicogen-bond was found in PH2Br•••Br2 complex. The charge transfer of lp(P) -σ*(Br-Y), lp(F) -σ*(Br-P), and lp(Br) -σ*(X-P) play important roles in the formation of the halogen-bonds and pnicogen-bonds, which lead to polarization of the monomers. The polarization caused by the halogen-bond is more obvious than that by the pnicogen-bond, resulting in that some halogen-bonds having little covalent character. The symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) energy decomposition analysis showes that the halogen-bond and pnicogen-bond interactions are predominantly electrostatic and dispersion, respectively. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Ab initio calculation; Halogen-bond; Interaction energy; Pnicogen-bond; Symmetry adapted perturbation theory","Calculations; Charge transfer; Chlorine; Chlorine compounds; Computational chemistry; Covalent bonds; Fluorine; Halogen compounds; Molecular physics; Nitrogen compounds; Perturbation techniques; Phosphorus compounds; Polarization; Quantum chemistry; Ab initio calculations; Halogen bonds; Interaction energies; Pnicogens; Symmetry adapted perturbation theory; Bromine"

The TOPAS collaboration is tackling this challenge by extending the current Monte Carlo tool to allow for sub-cellular in silico simulations in a new extension, TOPAS-nBio. TOPAS wraps and extends the Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit and the new extension allows the modeling of particles down to vibrational energies (∼2 eV) within realistic biological geometries. Here we present a validation of biological geometries available in TOPAS-nBio, by comparing our results to two previously published studies. We compare the prediction of strand breaks in a simple linear DNA strand from TOPAS-nBio to a published Monte Carlo track structure simulation study. While TOPAS-nBio confirms the trend in strand break generation, it predicts a higher frequency of events below an energy of 17.5 eV compared to the alternative Monte Carlo track structure study. This is due to differences in the physics models used by each code. We also compare the experimental measurement of strand breaks from incident protons in DNA plasmids to TOPAS-nBio simulations.

Characterization by Boehm titrations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that resin has the largest densities of oxygen groups with a higher O/C atomic ratio (0.381) compared to CNPs (0.059). Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy indicated a spherical shape for both adsorbents with a mean diameter of about 50 nm and 100 nm for CNPs and resin, respectively. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms showed that CNPs present a high specific surface area, (SBET = 662 m2/g) and total pore volume (VT = 1.33 cm3/g) compared to the resin. A stepwise shape was observed in the adsorption isotherms indicating two different processes. At low concentration, the resin presented a higher adsorbed uptake (0.38 mg/mg) compared to CNPs (0.21 mg/mg) due to its higher amount of oxygen groups. At high concentration, the adsorbed quantity for CNPs (1.30 mg/mg) was higher than the one for the resin (0.97 mg/mg) which is probably due to the porosity effect. To better understand this adsorption behavior, a new approach based on statistical physics was developed.

Therefore, alternative production protocols are being actively pursued and interesting options include water injection and polymer flooding. Indeed, such techniques have been successfully tested in recent laboratory investigations, where X-ray scans performed on homogeneous rock slabs during water flooding experiments have shown evidence of an interesting new phenomenon-post-breakthrough, highly dendritic water fingers have been observed to thicken and coalesce, forming braided water channels that improve sweep efficiency. However, these experimental studies involve displacement mechanisms that are still poorly understood, and so the optimization of this process for eventual field application is still somewhat problematic. Ideally, a combination of two-phase flow experiments and simulations should be put in place to help understand this process more fully. To this end, a fully dynamic network model is described and used to investigate finger thickening during water flooding of extra-heavy oils. The displacement physics has been implemented at the pore scale and this is followed by a successful benchmarking exercise of the numerical simulations against the groundbreaking micromodel experiments reported by Lenormand and co-workers in the 1980s. A range of slab-scale simulations has also been carried out and compared with the corresponding experimental observations. We show that the model is able to replicate finger architectures similar to those observed in the experiments and go on to reproduce and interpret, for the first time to our knowledge, finger thickening following water breakthrough. We note that this phenomenon has been observed here in homogeneous (i.e. un-fractured) media: the presence of fractures could be expected to exacerbate such fingering still further. Finally, we examine the impact of several system parameters, including core length, wettability and injection rate, on the extent and efficiency of the finger swelling phenomenon. © 2017 Regaieg et al.",,"oil; water; analytical parameters; Article; chemical phenomena; dynamics; experimental study; flooding; knowledge; mathematical model; phenomenology; physical chemistry; physics; reproducibility; simulation; wettability"

Direct density functional theory (DFT) simulation of inorganic materials and molecular transition metal complexes is often used to describe subtle trends in inorganic bonding and spin-state ordering, but these calculations are computationally costly and properties are sensitive to the exchange-correlation functional employed. To begin to overcome these challenges, we trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict quantum-mechanically-derived properties, including spin-state ordering, sensitivity to Hartree-Fock exchange, and spin-state specific bond lengths in transition metal complexes. Our ANN is trained on a small set of inorganic-chemistry-appropriate empirical inputs that are both maximally transferable and do not require precise three-dimensional structural information for prediction. Using these descriptors, our ANN predicts spin-state splittings of single-site transition metal complexes (i.e., Cr-Ni) at arbitrary amounts of Hartree-Fock exchange to within 3 kcal mol-1 accuracy of DFT calculations. Our exchange-sensitivity ANN enables improved predictions on a diverse test set of experimentally-characterized transition metal complexes by extrapolation from semi-local DFT to hybrid DFT. The ANN also outperforms other machine learning models (i.e., support vector regression and kernel ridge regression), demonstrating particularly improved performance in transferability, as measured by prediction errors on the diverse test set. We establish the value of new uncertainty quantification tools to estimate ANN prediction uncertainty in computational chemistry, and we provide additional heuristics for identification of when a compound of interest is likely to be poorly predicted by the ANN. The ANNs developed in this work provide a strategy for screening transition metal complexes both with direct ANN prediction and with improved structure generation for validation with first principles simulation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.",,"Binary alloys; Chemical bonds; Chromium alloys; Chromium compounds; Complex networks; Computation theory; Computational chemistry; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Electronic structure; Forecasting; Metals; Molecular physics; Neural networks; Nickel alloys; Quantum theory; Regression analysis; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Uncertainty analysis; Exchange-correlation functionals; First-principles simulations; Hartree-Fock exchanges; Kernel ridge regressions; Machine learning models; Structural information; Support vector regression (SVR); Uncertainty quantifications; Metal complexes"

PROGRAM SUMMARY: Program title: hfbtho v3.00. Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/c5g2f92by3.1 Licensing provisions: GPL v3. Programming language: FORTRAN-95. Journal reference of previous version: M.V. Stoitsov, N. Schunck, M. Kortelainen, N. Michel, H. Nam, E. Olsen, J. Sarich, and S. Wild, Comput. Phys. Commun. 184 (2013). Does the new version supersede the previous one: Yes. Summary of revisions: 1. the Gogny force in both particle-hole and particle-particle channels was implemented;. 2. the nuclear collective inertia at the perturbative cranking approximation was implemented;. 3. fission fragment charge, mass and deformations were implemented based on the determination of the position of the neck between nascent fragments;. 4. the regularization method of zero-range pairing forces was implemented;. 5. the localization functions of the HFB solution were implemented;. 6. a MPI interface for large-scale mass table calculations was implemented. Nature of problem: hfbtho is a physics computer code that is used to model the structure of the nucleus. It is an implementation of the energy density functional (EDF) approach to atomic nuclei, where the energy of the nucleus is obtained by integration over space of some phenomenological energy density, which is itself a functional of the neutron and proton intrinsic densities. In the present version of hfbtho, the energy density derives either from the zero-range Skyrme or the finite-range Gogny effective two-body interaction between nucleons. Nuclear super-fluidity is treated at the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov (HFB) approximation. Constraints on the nuclear shape allows probing the potential energy surface of the nucleus as needed e.g., for the description of shape isomers or fission. The implementation of a local scale transformation of the single-particle basis in which the HFB solutions are expanded provide a tool to properly compute the structure of weakly-bound nuclei. Solution method: The program uses the axial Transformed Harmonic Oscillator (THO) single-particle basis to expand quasiparticle wave functions. It iteratively diagonalizes the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov Hamiltonian based on generalized Skyrme-like energy densities and zero-range pairing interactions or the finite-range Gogny force until a self-consistent solution is found.

Ni incorporation in PbSe introduces Ni impurity bands located near the valence band and also induces bandgap narrowing (BGN) by shifting the Fermi level deep into the valance band. This affects the charge carrier transport to decrease the resistivity and to maintain high Seebeck coefficient of ∼230 μV/K.

Very often the sampling is severely limited by complexity of the phase space, possibly leading to poorly converged or inaccurate free energy profiles. We explored the factors governing the completeness of reaction path sampling for the rate limiting step of phenylethylamine oxidation by lumiflavin in the gas phase, a reaction important for the pharmacology of the central nervous system. The simulations utilize the free energy perturbation sampling technique together with the empirical valence bond methodology for the free energy calculations. The simplicity of the system allows for the acquisition of fully converged free energy profiles, even for simulation free of restraints. The bottleneck for convergence is in the noticeably poorer sampling statistics in the transition state region, which is resolved by performing sufficiently long simulation to ensure reversibility of all processes accompanying the reaction. In the present case, convergence is attained in microseconds of simulation, but the required simulation time generally depends on the complexity of the potential energy surface pertinent to the reaction. Accordingly, the use of restraints reduces the complexity of the phase space, decreasing the required time by about an order of magnitude. In the case of elementary nucleophilic substitution with even simpler potential energy surface convergence is reached already at a timescale of few nanoseconds. For related biomolecular reactions embedded in an enzyme, significantly longer simulation times may be needed, rendering the sampling problem exceedingly difficult and representing a challenge for advanced sampling techniques. Accordingly, suggestions are given for optimal simulation of biomolecular reactions based on the presently employed techniques and under the aforementioned limitations. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Enzymes; Free energy; Gases; Molecular physics; Perturbation techniques; Phase space methods; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Reaction kinetics; Sampling; Surface reactions; Advanced samplings; Biomolecular reactions; Central nervous systems; Free energy perturbation; Free-energy calculations; Nucleophilic substitutions; Rate-limiting steps; Simulation of Chemical Reactions; Importance sampling"

Turbulent syngas (CO/H2/air) flames with different equivalence ratios, H2/CO ratios, and turbulence intensities are computed by Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) in order to obtain an indirect but accurate estimation of heat release profiles. To check the robustness of the estimation, two different kinetic mechanisms have been considered. Based on a direct image analysis of the DNS results, normalized species concentrations combined with exponents are systematically tested in an attempt to reconstruct as accurately as possible the field of heat release rate. A systematic comparison is used to identify the best possible exponents associated with each species combination. Differing from previous studies, the present analysis takes into account the local thickness of the turbulent heat release zone. As a consequence, the obtained optimal species combinations represent not only the position of peak heat release but also local changes in the topology of the reaction zone (thickness, curvature). In the end, the heat release rate of atmospheric syngas flames can, in general, be best approximated using the concentrations of HCO and OH, using c¯HCO1.5×c¯OH0.75, when considering only species that are measurable by Laser-Induced Fluorescence. Another excellent reconstruction would be c¯CH2O0.32×c¯OH0.8, for cases where CH2O is preferred to HCO. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","DNS; Flame front; Heat release rate; Reconstruction","Image reconstruction; Physical chemistry; Physics; Accurate estimation; Equivalence ratios; Flame front; Heat Release Rate (HRR); Kinetic mechanism; Laser induced fluorescence; nocv1; Species concentration; Turbulence intensity; Synthesis gas"

We demonstrate that quantum photobiological systems must be sustainable for them to simultaneously endure continuous energy transfer and keep their internal structure from destruction or critical instability. These quantum effects occur due to the interaction of PBCs with their environment which can be described by means of the reduced density operator and effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NH). Sustainable NH models of EET predict the coherence beats, followed by the decrease of coherence down to a small, yet non-zero value. This indicates that in sustainable PBCs, quantum effects survive on a much larger time scale than the energy relaxation of an exciton. We show that sustainable evolution significantly lowers the entropy of PBCs and improves the speed and capacity of EET. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the time and space complexity of electronic structure calculations, commonly used to generate PES, increases exponentially with an increasing number of atoms. The use of mathematical functions to model the topology of conformational PES is an alternative to more computer-intensive quantum chemical calculations, but the choice and complexity of functions used are crucial in achieving more accurate results. This paper presents a method to illustrate the topology of amino acid diamide PESs through a linear combination of a Fourier series and a mixture of Gaussian functions. Results yield a significantly small error, with an average RMSE of 4.9946 kJ mol-1 for all fits, which suggest that these functions may be used to represent the topology of the PESs, with around twofold order of magnitude decrease in computational time, with respect to DFT electronic structure calculations. This study ultimately aims to provide a foundation for a framework on building polypeptide PES from individual amino acid PESs. © 2017 Published by NRC Research Press.","Analytical fitting; Conformational analysis; Parameter search; Potential energy surfaces","Amino acids; Atoms; Conformations; Electronic structure; Fourier series; Functions; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Quantum chemistry; Rate constants; Topology; Analytical fitting; Conformational analysis; Electronic structure calculations; Mathematical functions; Parameter search; Quantum chemical calculations; Relative stabilities; Time and space complexity; Potential energy surfaces"

Ti was used as the dopant to improve its mechanical properties and oxidation resistance. The microstructure of the coatings changed from coarse columnar platelet structure at low Ti content (0–1.8 at.%) to a denser columnar microstructure at increased Ti content. The hardness and elastic modulus of the MoS2/Ti composite coatings gradually increase as the Ti content increases. The tribological properties of the coatings were evaluated against a GCr15 ball under different relative humidity atmosphere to verify the oxidation resistance. The results show that doping of Ti can significantly improve the oxidation resistance of the coatings. Particularly, the friction coefficient for the composite coating with 10.8 at.% Ti exhibited almost the same friction coefficient under three different humidity. However, excessive Ti induced high brittleness and the coatings flaking easily from the substrate; therefore, the coatings show poor wear resistances under both dry and humidity atmospheres. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Humidity; MoS2/Ti composite coatings; Oxidation resistance; Tribology","Atmospheric humidity; Fracture mechanics; Friction; Inorganic coatings; Microstructure; Molybdenum compounds; Oxidation resistance; Tribology; Columnar microstructures; Friction coefficients; Hardness and elastic modulus; Ti content; Tribo-chemistry; Tribo-physics; Tribological properties; Unbalanced magnetron sputtering systems; Composite coatings"

The formation of the cyclobutadiene + CO products via a ring contraction/CO elimination mechanism is shown to be the prevailing channel for the unimolecular decomposition of C5H4O. The unimolecular reaction is found to be relatively slow, but decomposition of cyclopentadienone can be greatly facilitated through bimolecular encounters with H atoms. The C5H4O + H reaction is predicted to be fast, with rate constants ranging from 4.6 × 10−12 to 1.8 × 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 at T = 500–2500 K and finite pressures. Cyclic C5H5O intermediates formed after the initial H addition undergo ring openings by β-scissions and then decompose to either butadienyl C4H5 + CO or 1-oxoprop-2-enyl H2CCHCO + C2H2, which are respectively predicted as the major and the minor reaction products. The calculations predict that thermal decomposition of the ortho and meta C5H5O radicals as well as pyranyl nearly exclusively forms the C4H5 + CO products, whereas decomposition of hydroxycyclopentadienyl C5H4OH predominantly produces cyclopentadienone + H. The C5H5 + O reaction is shown to proceed by barrierless oxygen addition to the ring followed by fast H migration, ring opening, and dissociation to C4H5 + CO. The C5H5 + O rate constant is calculated to be close to 1 × 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 and to be pressure-independent and nearly independent of temperature.

Two different approaches such as the high-pressure, high-temperature method and ceramic combinatorial chemistry will be reported with application to several typical examples. First, we highlight the key role of the extreme conditions in the growth of Fe-based superconductors, where a careful control of the composition-structure relation is vital for understanding the microscopic physics. The availability of high-quality LnFeAsO (Ln = lanthanide) single crystals with substitution of O by F, Sm by Th, Fe by Co, and As by P allowed us to measure intrinsic and anisotropic superconducting properties such as Hc2, Jc. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combinatorial ceramic chemistry is an efficient way to search for new superconducting compounds. A single-sample synthesis concept based on multi-element ceramic mixtures can produce a variety of local products. Such a system needs local probe analyses and separation techniques to identify compounds of interest.

Due to being obscured by corrosion products and little loss of material with small effect on the surface, this kind of corrosion is extremely insidious. In this work, a novel multi-physics model is proposed to investigate the growth behavior of pitting corrosion in the presence of fluid flow. Various physical and chemical phenomena are taken into account in a coupled scheme, including chemical reactions, electrochemical reactions, flow disturbance and the mass transport of species. The mass transport is attributed to diffusion, electro-migration and convection. The time-dependent evolution of the pit morphology is implemented via an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method. The mechanism of the pitting corrosion is revealed with the integration of flow field, local chemical environment and the electrochemical behavior within the pit hole. Special emphasis is put on the relationship between the flowing fluid and the corrosion behavior. The results show that the flowing fluid would result in an asymmetric distribution of the species concentration and corrosion current density within the pit hole. It is found that the pit growth dynamics is determined by the combined effect of solution chemistry and electrical field. It is also indicated that the pH in the bulk solution and the flow rate have a significant coupling influence on the pitting corrosion behavior. © 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

As liquids composed solely of ions, the scientific consensus has been that ionic liquids have exceedingly high ionic strengths and thus very short Debye screening lengths. However, several recent experiments from laboratories around the world have reported data for the approach of two surfaces separated by ionic liquids which revealed remarkable long range forces that appear to be electrostatic in origin. Evidence has accumulated demonstrating long range surface forces for several different combinations of ionic liquids and electrically charged surfaces, as well as for concentrated mixtures of inorganic salts in solvent. The original interpretation of these forces, that ionic liquids could be envisioned as “dilute electrolytes,” was controversial, and the origin of long range forces in ionic liquids remains the subject of discussion. Here we seek to collate and examine the evidence for long range surface forces in ionic liquids, identify key outstanding questions, and explore possible mechanisms underlying the origin of these long range forces. Long range surface forces in ionic liquids and other highly concentrated electrolytes hold diverse implications from designing ionic liquids for energy storage applications to rationalizing electrostatic correlations in biological self-assembly. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"ion; ionic liquid; nanomaterial; Article; dielectric constant; force; ionic strength; physics; static electricity; surface property"

Thus, development of robust and easy procedures for molecular diodes with stable rectification effect is the top priority for the community in this field. Herein, we report a new home-made quasi-molecular rectifier based on a coordinated framework thin film prepared by a layer-by-layer dip-coating method. The as-fabricated rectifier exhibits an average rectification ratio as high as 5.7 and excellent cycle stability over 300 cycles, rendering it a very promising candidate for practical application in comparison with previously reported molecular rectifiers. Besides, such a diode fabrication process can be easily achieved without the aid of expensive scanning tunneling microscopes, precise electrodes approaching operations at an Ångström scale, and other complex techniques.

This compound can store a total of 26.8 wt% hydrogen, both as molecular hydrogen and chemically bonded hydrogen in AB, making it one of the most hydrogen-rich solids currently known.

In these hexacoordinated complexes, the bpp (2,6-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine) ligands adopt a mer-mer coordination mode and carry COOMe or C(O)NHC(CH2OH)3para substituents, respectively, on the central pyridyl ring. In spite of the almost equal donor power of the ligands to the iron(ii) centre, the two compounds feature different spin state configurations at room temperature. Compound 1 displays a highly-distorted octahedral environment around the iron(ii) centre, which adopts a high spin (HS) state at all temperatures, even under an external applied pressure up to 1.0 GPa. By contrast, 2 is characterized by a more regular octahedral coordination around the metal ion and exhibits a low spin (LS) configuration at or below room temperature. However, it shows a thermally-induced SCO behaviour at T &gt; 400 K, along with Light-Induced Excited Spin State Trapping (LIESST) at low temperature, with TLIESST = 38 K. Since DFT (U)M06/6-311+G(d) geometry optimizations in vacuo indicate that both complexes should adopt a HS state and a highly-distorted coordination geometry, the stabilization of a LS configuration in 2 is ultimately ascribed to the effect of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which align the [Fe(bpp-triolH3)2]2+ cations in 1D chains and impart profound differences in the geometric arrangement of the ligands. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Coordination reactions; Excited states; Geometry; Hydraulic structures; Hydrogen bonds; Iron; Ligands; Metal ions; Metals; Molecular physics; Organic polymers; Pyridine; Spin dynamics; Temperature; Coordination geometry; Coordination modes; Geometry optimization; Intermolecular hydrogen bonds; Light-induced excited spin-state trapping; Octahedral coordination; Octahedral environment; Thermally induced; Iron compounds"

Our approach for the determination of reaction rate coefficients is to first compute potential energy surfaces based on accurate solutions of the electronic Schrödinger equation and then use quasiclassical trajectory calculations to obtain reaction cross sections and rate coefficients based on these potentials. We have presented new rate coefficients for N2 dissociation and CO dissociation and exchange reactions. These results illustrate shortcomings with some of the rate coefficients in Park’s original T-Tv model for Mars entries and with some of the 30-45 year old shock tube data. We observe that the shock tube experiments of CO + O dissociation did not adequately account for the exchange reaction that leads to formation of C + O2. This reaction is actually the primary channel for CO removal in the shock layer at temperatures below 10,000 K, because the reaction enthalpy for exchange is considerably lower than the comparable value for dissociation. The rate coefficients reported herein should reduce the uncertainty in modeling hypersonic flows expected for entry of heavy spacecraft into the Martian atmosphere. © 2017 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,

This multiday laboratory experiment introduces students to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and to the uptake of both uncoated and coated MNPs by microorganisms. To highlight the possible uses and potential consequences of the uptake of MNPs, a procedure was developed to ""feed"" small magnetic particles to paramecia, a process that can be observed using an optical microscope. During extensive laboratory analysis, uptake of the MNPs by these microorganisms was noted with all three species of paramecia examined: Paramecium aurelia, Paramecium bursaria, and Paramecium caudatum. The paramecia clearly ingested the iron oxide MNPs, but the amount of magnetic material per microorganism varied. In some cases, we were able to manipulate the ""magnetized"" P. aurelia and P. bursaria using a magnetic field. Uptake of uncoated MNPs led to microorganism death within the initial 12-18 h observation window. However, paramecia that ingested MNPs coated with the polymer poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) were still alive 1 week after ingestion.

A typical variant of this art is fluid transport within small channels, either in form of laminar co-flow of miscible streams or in form of segmented-flow dripping and jetting of immiscible streams. Either method provides means to expose components of interest to defined local conditions such as spatially controlled concentration profiles that could not be established without the microfluidic auxiliaries. This ability renders microfluidics uniquely useful as both a method for advanced analytics and synthesis. This article sheds a spotlight on the use and utility of this method in macromolecular chemistry and physics. In this field, the synthetic aspect of microfluidics has been widely explored in macromolecular materials engineering, primarily by the use of droplets as templates to form various types of polymeric particles and capsules, whereas the analytical aspect has most prominently been employed for research on biopolymers.

Key to the development of a model of flotation is the ability to validate it from measurements of a real flotation system. This work uses positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) to track directly activated mineral particles, hydrophobic and hydrophilic, in a lab-scale flotation cell. In contrast to other particle activation methods the direct activation technique allows mineral particles with their original surface characteristics to be used in PEPT experiments. In this work the flotation separation investigated was the separation of hematite from quartz from a synthetic ore using a combination of an oleic acid collector and sodium silicate depressant. This work represents the first time in which particles of typical flotation size (−106 + 90 μm diameter) with real bulk mineral properties and surface chemistry have been tracked in a flotation cell. The results illustrate small particles flow behaviour in the cell for a hydrophilic particle. The trajectory and velocities of the tracer particle are shown as it is transported inside the flotation cell. © 2016","Direct activation; Hematite; Iron ore flotation; Positron emission particle tracking; Quartz","Cells; Chemical activation; Cytology; Electrons; Flotation; Hematite; Hydrophilicity; Iron ores; Minerals; Positrons; Quartz; Silicates; Silicon compounds; Surface chemistry; Direct activation; Flotation separation; Hydrophilic particles; Hydrophobic and hydrophilic; Mineral particles; Particle activation; Positron emission particle tracking; Surface characteristics; Ore treatment"

The surface of the atmospheric-pressure-plasma-treated membrane separator was found to be highly hydrophilic realized by adjusting the plasma power input. The variations in membrane separator chemical structure were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Chemical analysis showed newly formed carbonyl-containing groups and high surface concentrations of oxygen-containing species on the atmospheric-pressure-plasma-treated polymeric separator surface. It also showed that surface hydrophilicity primarily increased from the polar component after atmospheric-pressure plasma treatment. The surface and pore structures of the polyethylene membrane separator were examined by scanning electron microscopy, revealing a slight alteration in the pore structure. As a result of the incorporation of polar functionalities by atmospheric-pressure plasma activation, the electrolyte uptake and electrochemical impedance of the atmospheric-pressure-plasma-treated membrane separator improved.

Impurity scattering is characterized by two different times, the transport and elastic scattering times, which are sensitive to the particular Dirac spectrum of graphene. The analysis of the ratio between these two times gives insight on the nature (neutral or charged) and range of the scatterers. We show how to extract these two times from magneto-transport measurements and analyze their differences in monolayer and bilayer Graphene in relation with the different symmetry properties of their band structure and wave functions. It is found that whereas short range impurity scattering is the dominant mechanism limiting the classical transport, phase coherent mesoscopic transport is very sensitive to long range disorder. In particular, the formation of electron/hole puddles in the vicinity of the charge neutrality point strongly affects the transport of Andreev pairs in the presence of superconducting electrodes. We will also discuss the modification of electronic properties of graphene in the presence of adsorbed atoms and molecules and in particular focus on spin dependent scattering on adsorbates leading to a spin orbit interaction. There is indeed a big interest in controlling and inducing spin orbit interactions in graphene. One can hope to induce and detect a spin Hall effect with a great potential impact in graphene based spintronic devices and ultimately reach a regime of quantum spin Hall physics. In contrast with these very short range scatterers, we discuss the possibility to engineer networks of longer range strained regions in which electronic properties are locally modified by transferring graphene on arrays of silicon oxyde nanopillars. © 2016 Springer Basel AG.",,"Coherent scattering; Electronic properties; Quantum chemistry; Quantum electronics; Quantum Hall effect; Spin Hall effect; Strained silicon; Wave functions; Classical transport; Electronic properties of graphene; Magneto-transport measurement; Mesoscopic transport; Spin dependent scattering; Spin orbit interactions; Superconducting electrodes; Symmetry properties; Graphene"

During fermentation and later baking a preferential lipid binding to the gluten/non-gluten proteins and to the outside and inside starch granules takes place at the expenses of both a free lipid displacement and a bound lipid translocation to new protein and starch active sites.

Undergraduate engineering education faces pressures to add technical and non-technical content and decrease total credit hours, educational costs, and time to degree. This study characterizes how discipline-based engineering programs in the United States distribute required coursework between technical and non-technical areas of study in comparison to math, chemistry, and physics programs; the results could signal consensus or disparity in educational philosophy between and among institutions or disciplines. The distribution of technical versus non-technical coursework was delineated for 103 US News &World Report top-ranked and ABET EAC-accredited undergraduate programs in chemical, civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering based on 2013 catalog requirements, as well as chemistry, math, and physics programs at the same institutions. Technical was defined as coursework in engineering, math or natural science; non-technical was coursework outside of those disciplines. Findings reveal a wide range of required technical and non-technical course loads for all disciplines. For engineering, technical requirements ranged from 62% to 86% (median 75%) of total degree; non-technical requirements ranged from 12% to 35% (median 20%). The math, chemistry, and physics degrees were more balanced between technical and non-technical requirements. Differences in requirements suggest that consensus does not exist amongst engineering educators from this sampling of programs regarding the appropriate allocation of technical versus non-technical coursework for an undergraduate engineering education, and there are substantially divergent interpretations of what constitutes adequate ""general education"" for an engineer. Additionally, students who desire more well-rounded education might select non-engineering STEM majors. © 2017 Tempus Publications.","Engineering curriculum; Humanities; Multi-institution; Quantitative; Social science; Undergraduate; United States","Behavioral research; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Social sciences; Technical presentations; Engineering curriculum; Humanities; Quantitative; Undergraduate; United States; Cost engineering"

In order to understand mechanisms of corrosion and the function of corrosion inhibitors, the reactions at the interfaces between the corrosive electrolyte and a steel surface, particularly at the initial stages of the corrosion process, need to be described. Naturally, these reactions are strongly affected by the nature and properties of the steel surfaces. It is however seen that the majority of recent corrosion and corrosion-inhibition investigations are limited to electrochemical testing, with ex situ analysis of the treated steels (post-exposure analysis). The characterization of materials and their surface properties, such as texture and morphology, are not being considered in most studies. Similarly, in situ investigations of the initial stages of the corrosion reactions using advanced surface characterization techniques are scarce. In this review, attention is brought to the importance of surface features of carbon steels, such as texture and surface energy, along with defects dislocation related to mechanical processing of carbon steels. This work is extended to a critical review of surface analytical techniques used for characterization of carbon steels in corrosive media with particular focus on examining steel surfaces treated with corrosion inhibitors. Further, emerging surface analysis techniques and their applicability to analyse carbon steels in corrosive media are discussed. The importance of surface properties is commonly addressed by surface scientists as well as researchers in other chemistry fields such as nanotechnology, fuel cells, and catalysis.

Why are women represented in some science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields more than others? We conduct a critical review of the most commonly cited factors explaining gender disparities in STEM participation and investigate whether these factors explain differential gender participation across STEM fields. Math performance and discrimination influence who enters STEM, but there is little evidence to date that these factors explain why women's underrepresentation is relatively worse in some STEM fields. We introduce a model with three overarching factors to explain the larger gender gaps in participation in computer science, engineering, and physics than in biology, chemistry, and mathematics: (a) masculine cultures that signal a lower sense of belonging to women than men, (b) a lack of sufficient early experience with computer science, engineering, and physics, and (c) gender gaps in self-efficacy.

While our knowledge society has embraced this view, fostering creativity is among the major challenges faced by educators and policymakers. For example, plagiarism, which may be considered a form of imitation and repetition, is a global concern at schools and universities. However, most discussions focus on academic integrity, which, we believe, leaves some gaps in the approach to the problem. As part of an ongoing project on plagiarism, science and education policy, we show results from a survey sent to 143 high-school science teachers at one of the most highly regarded federal schools in Brazil. Among respondents (n=42), about 50% admit that students plagiarize in assignments. Additionally, many of these educators suggest that the way biology, chemistry and physics are taught at school stimulates more repetition than creativity. Our findings are consistent with the need for a broader perspective on plagiarism and with initiatives to stimulate creativity and critical thinking among students. Although we offer a perspective from Brazil, it may illuminate current discussions on plagiarism, particularly in emerging countries. © 2017, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

Reported scientific uncertainties were studied by analysing 41 000 measurements of 3200 quantities from medicine, nuclear and particle physics, and interlaboratory comparisons ranging from chemistry to toxicology. Outliers are common, with 5σ disagreements up to five orders of magnitude more frequent than naively expected. Uncertainty-normalized differences between multiple measurements of the same quantity are consistent with heavy-tailed Student’s t-distributions that are often almost Cauchy, far from a Gaussian Normal bell curve. Medical research uncertainties are generally as well evaluated as those in physics, but physics uncertainty improves more rapidly, making feasible simple significance criteria such as the 5σ discovery convention in particle physics. Contributions to measurement uncertainty from mistakes and unknown problems are not completely unpredictable. Such errors appear to have power-law distributions consistent with how designed complex systems fail, and how unknown systematic errors are constrained by researchers. This better understanding may help improve analysis and meta-analysis of data, and help scientists and the public have more realistic expectations of what scientific results imply. © 2017 The Authors.","Complex systems; Measurement uncertainty; Meta-analysis; Metrology; Research reproducibility; Systematic errors",

The contents of the three disciplines (physics, chemistry, biology) were reconstructed focusing on six basic aspects of energy (forms, transfer, transformation, conservation, degradation, and entropy) and using common teaching methodologies. The module was assessed with 39 secondary school students (aged 15-16) using a 30-question research instrument and a treatment/control group methodology.

For statistical copolymers, the link between chemistry (copolymerization to characterize statistical copolymers) and physics (crystallization to determine structures and properties) has recently been enhanced. This review discusses how the crystallization behavior and resulting semicrystalline structure of statistical copolymers are affected by the various microstructure parameters of their comonomers, such as content, distribution along or even among polymer chains, and size (determining their inclusion in or exclusion from the crystallites). The discussion of crystallization is focused on its interplay with component segregation at three different length scales: monomer, monomer sequence, and macromolecule.

Two sets of superlattice reflections including the B-site atom ordering type reflection and the lead-ion antiparallel ordering type reflection were confirmed and distinguished from the X-ray diffraction patterns and transmission electron microscopy. Micro-domains and macro-domains were observed under the microscopes. The investigations were focused on the extinction angle, the angle of the domain wall and temperature dependence. The Curie temperature TC was about 240 °C and 254 °C for [111]-oriented and [001]-oriented crystal plates respectively. The value of the energy density was calculated to be 3.65 J cm-3 for the [111]-oriented sample at 200 °C based on the double hysteresis loops with an electric field EAPP = 170 kV cm-1 applied. All the above features, especially the high Curie temperature and high energy storage density, suggested that the PLN single crystals should be useful for large size energy storage devices that require a wider operation temperature range. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Antiferroelectricity; Crystal structure; Curie temperature; Electric fields; Energy storage; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Lead; Lutetium; Niobium; Temperature distribution; Thermoelectricity; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Anti ferroelectrics; Antiferroelectric properties; High Curie temperature; High energy storage densities; Operation temperature; Super-lattice structures; Superlattice reflections; Temperature dependence; Single crystals"

The magic angle effect is due to the unique oriented structure of collagen fibrils that occur in cartilage, tendon, ligaments and other connective tissues. One-dimensional ice-like water bridges bound in a repetitive manner to the backbone of the collagen molecule form a constant time-average proton-proton (P-P) vector coaxial with fibril orientation. Constant P-P induces frequency shifts (Δωmax ∼ 1000 Hz) due to the fixed orientation of an exchangeable proton relative to the fixed magnetic dipole field (ΔBmax ∼ ±10 Gauss) of the neighboring immobilized bridge proton on the same water molecule. The T2∗ relaxation time caused by rapid dephasing of net magnetization in the x-y plane results from stochastic sampling of solid-like dipole coupling ΔB(θ) by mobile protons. T2∗(θ) becomes a function of orientation as the effective local field in the collagen fibril is Be = Bo + ΔB(θ) and ΔB(θ) varies as a function of the angle between the vectors B0 and P-P. The stoichiometric hydration model provides modeling tools to relate changes in T1, T2∗ and T1ρ with orientation to specific changes in collagen structure. It is anticipated that advanced studies will in future relate measurable molecular shifts to disease progression in osteoarthritis and other injuries to cartilage. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.",,

The computational cost of first principle phonon calculations typically scales steeply as O(Ne 4), where Ne is the number of electrons in the system. In this work, we develop a new method for reducing the computational complexity of computing the full dynamical matrix, and hence the phonon spectrum, to O(Ne 3). The key concept for achieving this is to compress the polarizability operator adaptively with respect to the perturbation of the potential due to the change of the atomic configuration.

We demonstrate that such systems are capable of being assembled from scratch from some atomic components, undergo a process of morphogenesis by the unfolding of the self-assembly rules defined by their local interactions, exhibit crucial properties of living cells as the self-healing property or mitosis (cell division), and eventually enter a stable equilibrium of adulthood in which they will continue to function as long as certain conditions in their environment remain.

It generally deals with genome informatics, protein structure and drug design. However, the data or information thus acquired from the main areas of bioinformatics may not be effective. Some researchers combined bioinformatics with wireless sensor network (WSN) into biosensor and other tools, and applied them to such areas as fermentation, environmental monitoring, food engineering, clinical medicine and military. In the combination, the WSN is used to collect data and information. The reliability of the WSN in bioinformatics is the prerequisite to effective utilization of information. It is greatly influenced by factors like quality, benefits, service, timeliness and stability, some of them are qualitative and some are quantitative. Hence, it is necessary to develop a method that can handle both qualitative and quantitative assessment of information. A viable option is the fuzzy linguistic method, especially 2-tuple linguistic model, which has been extensively used to cope with such issues. As a result, this paper introduces 2-tuple linguistic representation to assist experts in giving their opinions on different WSNs in bioinformatics that involve multiple factors. Moreover, the author proposes a novel way to determine attribute weights and uses the method to weigh the relative importance of different influencing factors which can be considered as attributes in the assessment of the WSN in bioinformatics. Finally, an illustrative example is given to provide a reasonable solution for the assessment. © 2017 by the authors.","2-tuple linguistic term set; Assessment; Bioinformatics; Reliability; Wireless sensor network","Bioinformatics; Linguistics; Medicine; Reliability; 2-tuple linguistic; 2-tuple linguistic models; 2-tuple linguistic representations; Assessment; Data and information; Environmental Monitoring; Genome informatics; Qualitative and quantitative assessments; Wireless sensor networks"

The TPACK that inservice teachers develop is practitioner-based and can be continuously transformed with teaching experiences. In this study, we constructed video-embedded and discipline-focused questionnaires to measure science teachers' TPACK. Item sets were generic across four disciplines and designed to investigate teachers' TPACK at different levels of the cognitive process. Each questionnaire was embedded with three instructional clips in which preservice teachers demonstrated their previously-prepared lessons on selected topics in biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. Through exploratory factor analysis, four factors (i.e., evaluation, evaluation/synthesis, application/analysis, and knowledge/comprehension) emerged from the data. The presumed hierarchical interrelationships among these cognitive processes were investigated through a path analysis. The findings indicated that teachers’ TPACK at the knowledge/comprehension level made significant loadings to TPACK at higher levels, but this was not the case for application/analysis. The disconnect for application/analysis within the simple-to-complex cognitive process hierarchy suggests that it should be viewed as different from the other three constructs that incorporate more instructional reasoning.

This study reflects on the nature of the learners’ attitude towards science and the effect of gender. A total of 547 Grade 7 learners from an urban district of Gauteng Province (South Africa) were administered a questionnaire to probe their attitudes and interests in learning science. The questionnaire itself was a modified version of an extant questionnaire, consisting of 15 questions. Learners were requested to indicate their degree of agreement or disagreement to each of the questionnaire item, on a five-point Likert-type scale of evaluation. The results were analysed in terms of the A (affection), B (behaviour) and C (cognition) model of attitudes. The results reflect positivity on many items of the questionnaire in the learning of science for all three components of attitude. On the issue of gender differentials, there appears to be no significant difference in attitude between Grade 7 boys and girls towards learning science from a South African perspective. In terms of subject preference, boys were more inclined to study physics and chemistry, while girls had a higher preference for biology and astronomy. However, the need for a dedicated laboratory to conduct experiments for the purposes of conceptual development was identified as a priority by the learners. © 2017 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (SAARMSTE).","Attitude to learning science; Gender difference; South Africa; Urban learners",

The Schlömilch’s integral equations have many applications in atmospheric, terrestrial physics and ionospheric problems. They describe the density profile of electrons from the ionospheric for awry occurrence of the quasi-transverse approximations. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors apply a regularization method combined with the standard homotopy analysis method to find the exact solutions for all forms of the Schlömilch’s integral equation. Second, the authors implement the regularization method with the variational iteration method for the same purpose. The effectiveness of the regularization-Homotopy method and the regularization-variational method is shown by using them for several illustrative examples, which have been solved by other authors using the so-called regularization-Adomian method. Findings: The implementation of the two methods demonstrates the usefulness in finding exact solutions. Practical implications: The authors have applied the developed methodology to the solution of the Rayleigh equation, which is an important equation in fluid dynamics and has a variety of applications in different fields of science and engineering. These include the analysis of batch distillation in chemistry, scattering of electromagnetic waves in physics, isotopic data in contaminant hydrogeology and others. Originality/value: In this paper, two reliable methods have been implemented to solve several examples, where those examples represent the main types of the Schlömilch’s integral models. Each method has been accompanied with the use of the regularization method. This process constructs an efficient dealing to get the exact solutions of the linear and non-linear Schlömilch’s integral equation which is easy to implement. In addition to that, the accompanied regularization method with each of the two used methods proved its efficiency in handling many problems especially ill-posed problems, such as the Fredholm integral equation of the first kind. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Homotopy analysis method; Regularization; Schlömilch’s integral equation; Variational iteration method","Chemical analysis; Distillation; Electromagnetic waves; Geophysics; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Integral equations; Design/methodology/approach; Fredholm integral equation of the first kind; Homotopy analysis methods; Regularization; Regularization methods; Scattering of electromagnetic waves; Science and engineering; Variational iteration method; Iterative methods"

Engineering college majors are more likely to find jobs after college that are outside of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, including jobs in healthcare, management, and social services. A survey of engineering undergraduate students at the University of Colorado Boulder in November 2012 indicated a desire by students to simultaneously pursue secondary teacher licensure alongside their engineering degrees: 25 percent ‘‘agreed’’ or ‘‘strongly agreed’’ that they ‘‘would be interested in earning grades 7–12 science or math teaching licenses while [they] earn [their] engineering degrees. As colleges of engineering education, how can we support the success of our students in these multidisciplinary fields post-graduation, including teaching? The University of Colorado Boulder’s College of Engineering and Applied Science in partnership with the School of Education, has developed an innovative program that results in graduates attaining a secondary school STEM teacher license concurrently with an engineering BS degree. This streamlined pathway through engineering educates and prepares a workforce of secondary teachers capable of high-level teaching in multiple STEM subjects—either engineering coupled with science (biology, chemistry, and physics), or engineering coupled with mathematics. These engineers are motivated and inspired to pursue two career routes because they find value and passion for both professions. One study showed that successful mathematics and science teachers ‘‘would have liked to be engineers’’. Teachers expressed that being comfortable and understanding engineering phenomena is a barrier to why they initially did not pursue an engineering career. We are fostering students that develop both an engineering mindset alongside a commitment to giving back through secondary teaching in this program. This research aims to discover if and how students in the engineering + teaching program identify themselves as both an engineering student and as a teaching student. We are exploring why students decided to pursue engineering and teaching and how they plan to use engineering, teaching, or both in their futures. It is important to also understand how we attract students to this program. Given the diverse student experience inherent in this degree program built around passion and desire to combine engineering and teaching, the paper addresses the questions, ‘‘How do engineering knowledge and teaching knowledge intersect for undergraduate engineering students?’’ and ‘‘What challenges exist to navigating an engineering major with a teaching license pathway?’’ Initial survey and focus group data collected this past academic year indicates that students in this degree program identify as both an engineer and a teacher. Using mixed-methods analysis informed by current education research—including quantitative and qualitative survey questions and small focus groups—we explore the ways in which students discovered this program and how they plan to incorporate the two disciplines in their future. We are interested in how engineering students will incorporate the knowledge that they learned in engineering classes into the lesson plans they design for secondary classroom students. © 2017, Purdue University Press.

Numerous advantages of functionalized patterned nanostructures especially in medical physics, chemistry, biology, and semiconductor quantum dot applications have rapidly driven the growth of this field in the last two decades. In particular, for applications involving biomedical imaging, the nanoparticles have attracted perhaps the greatest attention as these materials provide a direct interface at the subcellular length scale. Reliable characterization methods are thus often needed to infer their detailed structural properties such as average particle size, particle shape, internal structure, surface morphology, distribution of particles, and their chemical composition. As a nondestructive probe, X-ray fluorescence measurements at grazing incidence provide sensitive information about the physical and chemical nature of the nanoparticles over the large surface area of a substrate. Herein, we demonstrate the potential capabilities of the X-ray fluorescence technique for reliable and precise determination of surface morphology of metal nanoparticles, dispersed on a flat surface. Our results show that X-ray standing wave assisted fluorescence measurements are markedly sensitive to the nature of dispersion of nanoparticles on a substrate surface. We have analyzed different types of nanostructured materials; e.g. a W thin film structure and Au nanoparticles deposited on a Si surface. The average size of the Au nanoparticles estimated, using X-ray standing wave fluorescence analysis, was found to closely agree with the atomic force microscopy measurements. The inherent features of the X-ray fluorescence technique permit us to analyze distribution of all kinds of metal and metalloid nanoparticles on a flat surface. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,

Corrosion of steel in concrete structures and fatigue of steel are examples of daily observed deterioration processes in structures now infrastructure becomes aged. The challenge for the nearby future is to keep the structures reliable at a high level of performance while the structure itself ages without having to spend huge amounts of money. For lifetime optimization, service life prediction, time-variant reliability and life cycle cost, time is a dominant factor. Engineering on these performances of a structures requires reliable predictions of how a structure functions in time. In time the materials used in the structure will change due to ageing. The origin of these changes are primary from the natural change in materials. A material will age even when it is not used at all. Other factors will influence the ageing process. The environment and its use of the material will influence the ageing process and can lead to enhancement of the rate of ageing. To improve the forecast of life time of structures knowledge of ageing is required. This knowledge can be gained with fundamental research on the chemistry, life science, physics, electromagnetism, mechanics, mathematics and design in respect to ageing. This research requires a multidisciplinary and multi-level scale approach. The Delft Centre of Materials initiated the Ageing Centre at the Delft University of Technology. Its goal is to investigate and model ageing phenomena at fundamental materials level and to make ageing predictable at the level of materials, devices, structures and systems. This paper presents the framework that will be used by the Ageing Centre with which the balance can be made between the required performance and the require efforts to maintain this performance. The framework also shows how knowledge of the materials gained from inspections and tests are used to make reliable predictions of material changes and how this can be used for life cycle engineering of civil structures. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Forecasting; Life cycle; Service life; Civil engineering structures; Corrosion of steel in concretes; Delft University of Technology; Deterioration process; Fundamental research; Life cycle engineering; Service life prediction; Time-variant reliability; Structural design"

In the middle of the course, blind students from high school were invited to participate in a class of characterization of nanomaterials, in order to share experience about nanotechnology concepts (senior students) and experience of life as a blind person. Because characterization of nanomaterials is a blind manipulation, due its atomic size, it is suitable activity for both the sighted and the visually impaired. Thus, the experience and different capabilities of blind students were of great interest to seniors that needed to learn above other possibilities and opportunities within characterization of nanomaterials. The visit of blind students made for a significant and emotive characterization class, specifically related to the concept and use of the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), which is known as a blind tool.

Ecological stoichiometry, combined with the basic principles of physics, biology, and chemistry, can be used to investigate the ecological processes affecting chemical elements. It can be used to investigate soil ecosystem nutrient cycling and to identify the limiting factors on plant growth when it is used in ionic rare earth mining ecology restoration projects. The present study used ecological stoichiometry to analyze the topsoil nutrient contents at soil sampling depths of 0—10 cm and 10—20 cm over three different management years in an ionic rare earth mining area and one unexploited rare earth mine in Changting County, Fujian Province. The results showed that the soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus contents were in the range of 0.69—15.7 g/kg, 0.26—1.21 g/kg, and 0.05—0.11 g/kg, respectively. The soil nutrient contents were higher in the 0—10 cm layer than in the 10—20 cm layer. The soil C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios were in the range of 0.89—15.42, 9.50—136.46, and 4.17—20.87, respectively. The ratios first decreased, and then increased as management time progressed. The soil ecological stoichiometry characteristics were affected mainly by the organic matter content because of the residual nitrogen levels and the loss of organic matter in the early management years. In the later management years, soil ecological stoichiometry characteristics were mainly affected by nitrogen limitation due to its increased loss during the late management period. Our research suggested that stress resistant plant species should be planted to take full advantage of the residual nitrogen in the early years of management. Plant growth and soil nitrogen uptake as time progresses means that nitrogen should be applied during the late management years to overcome nitrogen limitations. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

In this work, the characterization of weak interactions between urea and cellulose in a LiOH/urea aqueous solution was accomplished and confirmed in situ, for the first time, using PFG-SE NMR, FT-IR and solvatochromic methods, etc. The NMR results indicated the binding of urea with cellulose in the solution, demonstrating the existence of the weak interactions between them. Subsequently, the solvatochromic methods revealed that urea hardly affected the hydrogen bond donor (HBD acidity) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA basicity) properties of the solvent, but was related to its dipolarity and polarizability, indicating that dispersion forces existed therein, but not likely hydrogen bonding, which was also supported by the FT-IR. Furthermore, the impact of weak interactions between urea and cellulose was demonstrated to facilitate the dissolving process. The fine dispersion and good stability of cellulose in the solution were maintained by mitigating the effect of the hydrophobic portions from all the dilute, semi-dilute and concentrated regimes, supported by the results of dynamic light scattering (DLS), rheology, NMR, etc. Therefore, the transmittance and mechanical properties of the regenerated cellulose materials prepared from the cellulose solution in the alkali/urea aqueous system were enhanced, compared with those in the alkali only system. This work provided significant and new experimental insights into the non-covalent weak interactions between urea and macromolecules from the viewpoints of polymer physics and physical chemistry, which could never be ignored and underestimated. The indispensable weak interactions in the system are also important for the green conversion of natural biomass into new materials via physical processes. © the Owner Societies 2017.",,

While solvable in the ideal case, little is known exactly about randomly branched polymers with volume interactions. Flory theory provides a simple, unifying description for a wide range of branched systems, including isolated trees in good and θ-solvent, and tree melts. In particular, the approach provides a common framework for the description of randomly branched polymers with quenched connectivity and for randomly branching polymers with annealed connectivity. Here we review the Flory theory for interacting trees in the asymptotic limit of very large polymerization degree for good solvent, θ-solutions and melts, and report its predictions for annealed connectivity in θ-solvents.

However, the physical origins of dynamic wrinkling in soft membranes are still not fully understood. Here we use milk skin as a tractable experimental system to investigate the physics of wrinkle formation in a thin, poroelastic film. Upon heating milk, a micron-thick hydrogel of denatured proteins and fat globules forms at the air-water interface. Over time, we observe an increase in the total length of wrinkles. By confocal imaging and profilometry, we determine that the composition and thickness of the milk skin appears to be homogeneous over the length scale of the wrinkles, excluding differences in milk skin composition as a major contributor to wrinkling. To explain the physical origins of wrinkle growth, we describe theory that considers the milk skin as a thin, poroelastic film where pressure is generated by the evaporative-driven flow of solvent across the film; this imparts in-plane stresses in the milk skin, which cause wrinkling. Viscous effects can explain the time-dependent growth of wrinkles. Our theoretical predictions of the effects of relative humidity on the total length of wrinkles over time are consistent with our experimental results. Our findings provide insight into the physics of the common phenomenon of milk skin wrinkling, and identify hydration gradients as another physical mechanism that can drive morphological instabilities in soft matter. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Air; Phase interfaces; Thin films; Air water interfaces; Confocal imaging; Denatured proteins; Experimental system; In-plane stress; Morphological instability; Physical mechanism; Wrinkle formation; Film growth"

Moreover, the platform relies less heavily on sophisticated fabrication techniques, often sufficient with a hydrophobic substrate, and no pump is required for operation. In addition, exploiting the physical phenomena that naturally arise when a droplet evaporates, such as the coffee-ring effect or Marangoni flow, can lead to fascinating applications.

Meanwhile, the d0 ferromagnetism was significantly enhanced. In combination with the fact that ambient O2 exposure also resulted in a significant boost of ferromagnetism in ZnO particles with different grain sizes, we surmise that adsorbed oxygen facilitates the d0 ferromagnetism in ZnO while VZn causes the 550 nm green emission.

Such variation has long been used to track animals as well as to diagnose illnesses in both humans and animals. However, the physics by which feces are discharged remain poorly understood. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we investigate the defecation of mammals from cats to elephants using the dimensions of large intestines and feces, videography at Zoo Atlanta, cone-on-plate rheological measurements of feces and mucus, and a mathematical model of defecation. The diameter of feces is comparable to that of the rectum, but the length is double that of the rectum, indicating that not only the rectum but also the colon is a storage facility for feces. Despite the length of rectum ranging from 4 to 40 cm, mammals from cats to elephants defecate within a nearly constant duration of 12 ± 7 seconds (N = 23). We rationalize this surprising trend by our mathematical model, which shows that feces slide along the large intestine by a layer of mucus, similar to a sled sliding down a chute. Larger animals have not only more feces but also thicker mucus layers, which facilitate their ejection. Our model accounts for the shorter and longer defecation times associated with diarrhea and constipation, respectively.

By incorporating three-dimensional (3D) nanoporous crystals with sub-nano sized aperture size into the 2D graphene laminates, both the inter-layer spacing and numbers of nanofluidic channels are increased, leading to greatly-enhanced water separation performance. The optimized 3D/2D membranes exhibit 15 times higher water permeability than that of the rGO membrane with similar high dye retention rate. The significance of such 3D nanoporous structure and transport mechanism through the 3D/2D membranes is systematically studied. This general approach of enhancing the molecular transport through 2D nanofluidic channels proposed here may also find application in gas separation and battery membranes. © 2017","Graphene; Membranes; Porous nanocrystals; Water purification","Graphene; Laminates; Membranes; Nanofluidics; Purification; Separation; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Molecular transport; Nanoporous crystals; Nanoporous structures; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Separation performance; Threedimensional (3-d); Two Dimensional (2 D); Water purification; Gas permeable membranes"

Besides, they need to promote the objective, fair clustering of papers, and analysis of research performance. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to find the optimum clustering algorithm using the MATLAB tools by comparing the performances of and the hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithms using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the conventional K-means clustering method. Design/methodology/approach: The clustering analysis experiment for each of the three fields of study – health and medicine, physics, and chemistry – used the following three algorithms: “K-means+Simulated annealing (SA)+Adjustment of parameters+PSO” (KASA-PSO clustering), “K-means+SA+PSO” clustering, “K-means+PSO” clustering. Findings: The clustering analyses of all the three fields showed that KASA-PSO is the best method for the minimization of fitness value. Furthermore, this study administered the surveys intended for the “performance measurement of decision-making process” with 13 members of the research fund organization to compare the group clustering by the clustering analysis method of KASA-PSO algorithm and the group clustering by research funds. The results statistically demonstrated that the group clustering by the clustering analysis method of KASA-PSO algorithm was better than the group clustering by research funds. Practical implications: This study examined the impact of bibliometric indicators on research impact of papers. The results showed that research period, the number of authors, and the number of participating researchers had positive effects on the impact factor (IF) of the papers; the IF that indicates the qualitative level of papers had a positive effect on the primary times cited; and the primary times cited had a positive effect on the secondary times cited. Furthermore, this study clearly showed the decision quality perceived by those who are working for the research fund organization. Originality/value: There are still too few studies that assess the research project evaluation mechanisms and its effectiveness perceived by the research fund managers. To fill the research void like this, this study aims to propose PSO and successfully proves validity of the proposed approach. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","K-means clustering method; Knowledge-based society; Particle swarm optimization; Research fund; Research impact; Research performance",

Climate change results directly from fossil fuel combustion that dominates the energy production system globally since the 1900's. Synthetic chemicals with carcinogenic, mutagenic and endocrine disrupting properties contaminate the biosphere. Ten thousand years of physical and biological stability of the planet shows signs of destabilizing. Yet, the credibility of scientists has come under attack, and science has become politicized and isolated from the mainstream of public influence. Rachel Carson, one of the most influential thought leaders of the twentieth century, offers a role model for addressing this critical problem. Through her gifted writing she shifted public opinion to understand the interconnectedness of all living systems. She spoke out as a scientist and an advocate in defense of protecting the natural world. Her recommendations based on sound science helped to shape the initial environmental protections that evolved through the nineteen seventies. She is a role model for the application of science in public policy. The acute environmental crises we face cross political and geographic divisions, and involve placing constraints on unfettered multi-national corporate interests whose only guide is success in the marketplace. Rachel Carson's work synthesized the principles that support precaution in man-made intrusions into the living world. Her graphic illustrations of the interconnectedness of all living systems showed that we cannot harm the environment without in turn harming ourselves. Natural laws of biology, physics and chemistry affect all countries, regardless of political persuasion, religion, social structure or priorities. Rachel Carson's environmental ethic provides a guide for decision-making that draws from our common humanity, and our common place in the global ecosystem as animals. Rachel Carson's environmental ethic has four parts: Live in harmony with nature; Preserve and learn from the natural places of the world; Minimize the impact of man-made chemicals on natural systems; and Consider the implications of all human actions on the global web of life. Governing our multiple forms of civilization according to the common laws of nature that drive life on earth can help to cross the barriers that divide us. Rachel Carson's environmental ethic can enlighten the debate over intergenerational and inter-cultural justice because the choices we face are a matter of ethics, not technology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental ethic; Interconnectedness; Intergenerational justice; Public awareness; Rachel Carson; Science in public policy","Biological systems; Climate change; Decision making; Endocrine disrupters; Fuels; Public policy; Social aspects; Environmental ethics; Interconnectedness; Intergenerational justice; Public awareness; Rachel Carson; Environmental technology"

The hot carriers are formed at the metal nanostructure semiconductor interface, and their efficient injection into the surrounding media (semiconductor) is a great challenge and understanding the physics behind the charge transfer is currently a topic of global research. Herein, we report the investigation on the hot electron injection in the Au nanoislands formed on a CdS film using ultrafast femtosecond spectroscopy. When the Au-CdS film is excited with visible light (above the band gap), a complete bleaching effect is observed. However, when it is excited with the photon energies below the band gap of the CdS film, an absorption signal is observed over a broad spectral range. The ultrafast charge transfer dynamics studied herein indicate the possibility of the plasmons formed in the Au nanoislands, which directly decay nonradiatively by injecting electrons in the conduction band of the CdS film and charge recombination with the Au nanoislands. Finally, we demonstrate the charge transfer in the metal semiconductor hybrid, which exhibits a significant alteration in the ultrafast optical properties compared to its individual components and is dependent on the excitation energy and can thus be exploited in the light harvesting devices. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cadmium sulfide; Charge transfer; Energy gap; Energy harvesting; Hot electrons; Light; Metal nanoparticles; Optical properties; Optoelectronic devices; Plasmons; Semiconductor devices; Charge recombinations; Charge-transfer dynamics; Femtosecond spectroscopy; Individual components; Metal semiconductors; Optoelectronic properties; Semiconductor heterostructures; Semiconductor interfaces; Gold"

It brings, to applications involving fluid-solid exchanges, advantages such as high surface to volume ratio, constant mixing, low flow resistance, continuous operation and high heat transfer. We present here the physics of a new miniaturized, microfluidic fluidized bed, in which gravity is replaced by a magnetic field created by an external permanent magnet, and the solid phase is composed of magnetic microbeads with diameters ranging from 1 to 5 μm. These beads can be functionalized with different ligands, catalysts or enzymes, in order to use the fluidized bed as a continuous purification column or bioreactor. It allows flow-through operations at flow rates ranging from 100 nL min-1 up to 5 μL min-1 at low driving pressures (&lt;100 mbar) with intimate liquid/solid contact and a continuous recirculation of beads for enhanced target capture efficiencies. The physics of the system presents significant differences as compared to conventional fluidized beds, which are studied here. The effects of magnetic field profile, flow chamber shape and magnetic bead dipolar interactions on flow regimes are investigated, and the different regimes of operation are described. Qualitative rules to obtain optimal operation are deduced. Finally, an exemplary use as a platform for immunocapture is provided, presenting a limit of detection of 0.2 ng mL-1 for 200 μL volume samples. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.",,

SUMMARY ANSWER: ART singletons had a significantly lower mean test score in the adjusted analysis when compared with SC singletons, yet the differences were small and probably not of clinical relevance. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Previous studies have shown similar intelligence quotient (IQ) levels in ART and SC children, but only a few have been on adolescents. Academic performance measured with standardized national tests has not previously been explored in a complete national cohort of adolescents conceived after ART. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A Danish national registry-based cohort including all 4766 ART adolescents (n = 2836 singletons and n = 1930 twins) born in 1995-1998 were compared with two SC control cohorts: a randomly selected singleton population (n = 5660) and all twins (n = 7064) born from 1995 to 1998 in Denmark. Nine children who died during the follow-up period were excluded from the study. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Mean test scores on a 7-point-marking scale from -3 to 12 were compared, and adjustments were made for relevant reproductive and socio-demographic covariates including occupational and educational level of the parents. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The crude mean test score was higher in both ART singletons and ART twins compared with SC adolescents. The crude mean differences were +0.41 (95% CI 0.30-0.53) and +0.45 (95% CI 0.28-0.62) between ART and SC singletons and between ART and SC twins, respectively. However, the adjusted mean overall test score was significantly lower for ART singletons compared with SC singletons (adjusted mean difference -0.15 (95% CI -0.29-(-0.02))). For comparison, the adjusted mean difference was +2.05 (95% CI 1.82-2.28) between the highest and the lowest parental educational level, suggesting that the effect of ART is weak compared with the conventional predictors. The adjusted analyses showed significantly lower mean test scores in mathematics and physics/chemistry for ART singletons compared with SC singletons. Comparing ART twins with SC twins yielded no difference in academic performance in the adjusted analyses. Similar crude and adjusted overall mean test scores were found when comparing ART singletons and ART twins. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Missing data on educational test scores occurred in 6.6% of adolescents aged 15-16 years for the birth cohorts 1995-1997, where all of the children according to their age should have passed the ninth grade exam at the time of data retrieval. As sensitivity analyses yielded no significant difference in the adjusted risk of having missing test scores between any of the groups, it is unlikely that this should bias our results. Adjustment for body mass index and smoking during pregnancy was not possible. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: As our results are based on national data, our findings can be applied to other populations. The findings of this paper suggest that a possible small negative effect of parental subfertility or ART treatment is counterbalanced by the higher educational level in the ART parents. © The Author 2016.

This technique is conceptually equivalent to the single chain in mean-field (SCMF) method in polymer physics, in the sense that non-bonded interactions are derived from the non-ideal chemical potential in self-consistent field (SCF) theory, after a particle-to-field projection. In contrast to SCMF, however, MD-SCF evolves particle coordinates by the usual Newton's equation of motion. Since collisions are seriously affected by the softening of non-bonded interactions that originates from their evaluation at the coarser continuum level, we have devised a way to reinsert the effect of collisions on the structural evolution. Merging MD-SCF with multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD), we mimic particle collisions at the level of computational cells and at the same time properly account for the momentum transfer that is important for a realistic system evolution. The resulting hybrid MD-SCF/MPCD method was validated for a particular coarse-grained model of phospholipids in aqueous solution, against reference full-particle simulations and the original MD-SCF model. We additionally implemented and tested an alternative and more isotropic finite difference gradient. Our results show that efficiency is improved by merging MD-SCF with MPCD, as properly accounting for hydrodynamic interactions considerably speeds up the phase separation dynamics, with negligible additional computational costs compared to efficient MD-SCF. This new method enables realistic simulations of large-scale systems that are needed to investigate the applications of self-assembled structures of lipids in nanotechnologies. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Computation theory; Dynamics; Efficiency; Equations of motion; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; Large scale systems; Merging; Phase separation; Phospholipids; Solutions; Full particle simulation; Hydrodynamic interaction; Multi-particle-collision dynamics; Newton's equation of motion; Nonbonded interaction; Phase separation dynamics; Self assembled structures; Self consistent field theory; Computational efficiency"

The radiation environment in the afterbody region poses significant challenges for accurate uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis due to the complexity of the flow physics, computational cost, and large number of uncertain variables. In this study, first a sparse collocation nonintrusive polynomial chaos approach along with global nonlinear sensitivity analysis was used to identify the most significant uncertain variables and reduce the dimensions of the stochastic problem. Then, a total-order stochastic expansion was constructed over only the important parameters for an efficient and accurate estimate of the uncertainty in radiation. Based on previous work, 388 uncertain parameters were considered in the radiation model, which came from the thermodynamics, flowfield chemistry, and radiation modeling. The sensitivity analysis showed that only four of these variables contributed significantly to afterbody radiation uncertainty, accounting for almost 95% of the uncertainty. These included the electronic-impact excitation rate for N between level 2 and level 5 and rates of three chemical reactions influencing N, N+, O, and O+ number densities in the flowfield.",,"Chemical analysis; Flow fields; Heat radiation; Radiant heating; Radiation; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic systems; Thermodynamics; Nonlinear sensitivity analysis; Radiation condition; Radiation environments; Stochastic problems; Uncertain parameters; Uncertain variables; Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty quantifications; Uncertainty analysis"

Therefore, it is understandable that studies of the excited states of DNA bases have attracted remarkable research interest. The challenge of experimental studies of DNA photo-physics stems from the intrinsic complexity of the dynamical behaviours of the excited states. In this regard, quantum mechanical methods for studying excited electronic states provide helpful insight. In this study we utilize time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to analyse the excited states of the DNA base-pair adenine-thymine in both the canonical Watson-Crick and stacked configurations. The excited state wavefunctions are analysed and visualized in terms of the one-electron transition density matrix (1TDM) and natural transition orbitals. The environmental effect on the excited states is considered by using a non-empirical effective fragment potential method. The extent of de-localization and the charge transfer character of the excited states in the near- and far-ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum are identified. It is also shown that the environmental effect on the de-localization is significant and varies with the configuration. Additionally, localized Frenkel type states, as well as de-localized states involving multiple molecular fragments, are also identified. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Density functional theory; DNA; Electron transitions; Orbits; Quantum theory; Solvents; Effective fragment potential methods; Electromagnetic spectra; Excited electronic state; Excited-state wavefunctions; Quantum mechanical method; State characteristics; Time dependent density functional theory; Transition density matrix; Excited states"

Compared with other 2D atom-thin layers, BP has a significantly anisotropic atomic structure, which can provide unique electronic, optical, and magnetic properties. Herein, we report the observation of B2/3 magnetic-field (B) dependence of the Hall resistance with extremely small quantized levels in the low-B regime of the few-layer BP, which are associated with the anisotropic electronic structure confirmed by largely anisotropic hole mobilities. One of the qualitative interpretations for the B2/3 dependence is the possible presence of a uniaxial Dirac spectrum (arising from a closed band gap caused by uniaxial stretch along the buckling armchair direction, which is occasionally introduced by a process for cutting and wire-bonding samples, confirmed by Raman spectroscopy) and its hybridization with a Schrödinger spectrum existing along a zigzag direction. The observed phenomena imply significant potential due to strong anisotropy of atom-thin (few-layer) BP, which is highly expected to open doors to novel physics and its application for innovative 2D atom-thin devices. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anisotropy; Electronic structure; Phosphorus; Hall resistance; ITS applications; Strong anisotropy; Structure-related; Thin semiconductor; Two Dimensional (2 D); Uni-axial stretch; Wire bonding; Atoms"

There are often advantages for using one software library over another, but the interface for each is different requiring specific code in a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) or analysis tool to access the underlying model. To provide a single interface for all thermodynamic software libraries, the Thermodynamic Application Program Interface (TAPI) was developed. TAPI provides a portable single interface for the CFD or analysis driver and a well-defined approach for wrapping any thermodynamic package as the model. A method to significantly improve the efficiency of the more expensive models through a quadtree database approach is available. A physics module provides common methods to compute static/total and shock jump conditions. This approach has been incorporated into three CFD codes and a general analysis package that provides a THermondyamic eXtension to NACA 1135 (THX1135). © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

However, no one knows exactly how these genetic codes came into being. Many biologists hold the pessimistic view that an exact reconstruction of the process of code construction may never be possible. It is even believed that the origin of the genetic code is unknowable, as there is no trace in physics or chemistry of the control of chemical reactions by a sequence of any sort or of a code between sequences. Many papers have been published with titles indicating that they explore the origin of the genetic code, but in actuality the content deals only with its evolution. More than half a century has passed since the discovery of genetic codes, but their origin is still one of the greatest mysteries in the modern life sciences. Are the genetic codons really unknowable? Do they require external design? So far, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of the genetic code, including the frozen accident hypothesis, stereochemical hypothesis, co-evolution hypothesis, and synthetic hypothesis. These hypotheses suffer from two fatal defects: first, none can explain satisfactorily why the genetic codes evolved, and second, none has explained the origin of genetic codes from that of the biochemical system (a relation of part to whole). In other words, all of these hypotheses completely overlooked the coevolution of genetic codes with the biochemical system. In recent decades, very little definitive progress has been made, although intensive studies have focused on variation or flexibility of the codes and possible rules of codon allocations to amino acids. This paper is aimed to explore the secrets of coevolution between the codon and the biochemical system. The genetic codes were likely an evolutionary product of primordial cells from energy transformation to informatization when ATP played a crucial role. Here, we present an ATP-centric hypothesis aimed at exploring the hidden primordial world inspiring the origin of genetic codes. We examined how and why ATP is at the heart of the extant biochemical system, and how the genetic codes came into being with the evolution of the biochemical system driven by photosynthesis. ATP, carriers of both energy and information, provide a bridge between amino acids and proteins, and are most likely the initiator of the genetic codes. In short, the energetic ATP together with its derivatives could randomly extend chains of both polynucleotides and polypeptides, which made it possible to establish or fix chemical relations between sequences of nucleotides in polynucleotides and amino acids in polypeptides from their numerous random combinations through a feedback mechanism (selection of cellular survival); and technically, photosynthesis, a goal-oriented process, enabled various biotic factors or reactions (ATP, lipid vesicle, informatization, structuralization, homogenous individual, individuality, survival, etc.) to be integrated into an operating system of genetic codes. It is challenging to crack the mystery of genetic codes, but sophisticated experimental evidence are needed in the future. © 2017, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The WACCM model, in turn, is nudged by winds and temperatures from the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System-Advanced Level Physics High Altitude (NOGAPS-ALPHA). This nudging has been shown to greatly improve the representation of key neutral constituents, such as nitric oxide (NO), that are used as inputs to the ionospheric model. We show that with this improved representation, we greatly improve the comparison between calculated and observed electron densities relative to older studies. At midlatitudes, for both winter and equinoctal conditions, the model agrees well with the data. At tropical latitudes, our results confirm a previous suggestion that there is a model deficit in the calculated electron density in the lowermost D region. We then apply the calculated electron densities to examine the variation of HF absorption with altitude, latitude, and season and from 2008 to 2009. For low latitudes, our results agree with recent studies showing a primary peak absorption in the lower E region with a secondary peak below 75 km. For midlatitude to high latitude, the absorption contains a significant contribution from the middle D region where ionization of NO drives the ion chemistry. The difference in middle- to high-latitude absorption from 2008 to 2009 is due to changes in the NO abundance near 80 km from changes in the wintertime mesospheric residual circulation.
