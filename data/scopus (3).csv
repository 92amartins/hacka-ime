In this paper a mathematic modeling of the main operating costs for production of collagen hydrolyzate from leather shavings is presented. The model is based on physical and chemical ongoing processes in the reactor and other parts of the production system, such as kinetics of the hydrolysis, mass and dry matter balances and protein balance in equilibrium. The aim is to determine optimal time of hydrolysis reaction, optimal mass fraction of decomposed protein and hence the main operating costs. The modeling is performed for a batch reactor and pilot plant conditions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Collagen hydrolyzate; Modeling; Operating costs; Protein; Waste","Batch reactors; Collagen; Costs; Hydrolysis; Models; Pilot plants; Proteins; Waste management; Wastes; Dry matters; Hydrolysis reaction; Leather shavings; Mass fraction; Mathematic model; Optimal time; Production system; Operating costs"

Children that age, however, are not always able to effectively use and commit with such application due to interaction barriers with them. In this paper, we present the design process and description of a mathematics learning application meant to overcome these barriers. Applying HCI techniques, a mobile application that implements the Doman Method for early development was designed. Using non-traditional interactions and augmented reality technologies, the system presents an intuitive interface that helps breaking the understanding barrier with children. Finally, we discuss an evaluation carried out by several experts to assess the achievement of a friendly-user and intuitive application design to enhance the engagement of children to the application and as such to the Doman Method. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Augmented reality; Cognitive walkthrough; Doman method; Early development; Human-Computer interactions; Mathematic learning; Mobile children applications; Parallel design","Augmented reality; Computer aided instruction; Human computer interaction; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Cognitive walkthrough; Doman method; Early development; Mathematic learning; Parallel design; Education"

To determine the cut-off point for 13C-urea breath test (13C-UBT) and to assess if it can be further optimized by serologic testing, mathematic modeling, histopathology and serologic validation were applied. A finite mixture model (FMM) was developed in 21,857 subjects, and an independent validation by modified Giemsa staining was conducted in 300 selected subjects. H.pylori status was determined using recomLine H.pylori assay in 2,113 subjects with a borderline 13C-UBT results. The delta over baseline-value (DOB) of 3.8 was an optimal cut-off point by a FMM in modelling dataset, which was further validated as the most appropriate cut-off point by Giemsa staining (sensitivity = 94.53%, specificity = 92.93%). In the borderline population, 1,468 subjects were determined as H.pylori positive by recomLine (69.5%). A significant correlation between the number of positive H.pylori serum responses and DOB value was found (rs = 0.217, P &lt; 0.001). A mathematical approach such as FMM might be an alternative measure in optimizing the cut-off point for 13C-UBT in community-based studies, and a second method to determine H.pylori status for subjects with borderline value of 13C-UBT was necessary and recommended. © 2017 The Author(s).",,

Such a feature makes SAT a promising material for seasonal solar thermal energy storage. The present study firstly summarized the thermo-physical properties of the solid SAT and liquid SA aqueous solution at different temperatures and concentrations, including equilibrium temperatures, densities, specific heats and thermal conductivities. The calculation methods of these properties have been established. Secondly, with the aid of the above properties, a mathematic model of the thermal discharge process of the storage system, i.e. the solidification process of supercooled SA aqueous solution, was built based on the heat transfer between the phase changing material within a single storage tube and the external flowing heat transfer fluid (HTF). The experimentally obtained SAT crystal growth rate and the enthalpy change of solidifying supercooled SA aqueous solution were employed to aid the modelling. The discharge temperature and thermal power of the storage system were numerically obtained and analysed. The influence of the ambient temperature, the mass flow rate as well as the heat transfer coefficient of the HTF on the thermal discharge performance were discussed. Finally, the seasonal thermal storage density of SAT was given and compared to that of water and some sorption materials. © 2017 The Authors","Energy density; Modelling; Sodium acetate trihydrate; Solidification process; Thermo-physical properties","Energy storage; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Models; Physical properties; Sodium; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solidification; Solutions; Storage (materials); Supercooling; Temperature; Thermal energy; Discharge temperature; Energy density; Equilibrium temperatures; Phase changing materials; Seasonal solar thermal energy storages; Sodium acetate trihydrate; Solidification process; Thermo-physical property; Thermal conductivity"

In the present work, the performance of Raphidocelis subcapitata exposed to heavy metals following standardized growth inhibition assays has been assessed in three different scenarios: 1) dilutions of single heavy metals, 2) artificial mixture of heavy metals at similar levels than those found in natural rivers and, 3) natural samples containing known mixtures of contaminants (heavy metals). Chemical speciation of heavy metals has been estimated with Eh-pH diagram and Visual MINTEQ software; heavy metal and free heavy metal ion concentrations were used as input data, together with microalgae growth inhibition, for Dr. Fit software. The final goal was to assess the suitability of the ecotoxicological test based on the growth inhibition of microalgae cultures, and the mathematic models based on these results, for regulatory and decision-making purposes. The toxicity of a given heavy metal is not only determined by its chemical speciation; other chemical and biological interaction play an important role in the final toxicity. Raphidocelis subcapitata 48h-h-EC50 for tested heavy metals (especially Cu and Zn) were in agreement with previous studies, when ion metal bioavailability was assumed to be 100%. Nevertheless, the calculated growth inhibition was not in agreement with the obtained inhibition when exposed to the artificial mixture of heavy metals or the natural sample. Interactions between heavy metal ions and the compounds of the culture media and/or the natural sample determine heavy metal bioavailability, and eventually their toxicity. More research is needed for facing the challenge posed by pollutant mixtures as they are present in natural environments, and make microalgae-based assays suitable for pollution management and regulatory purposes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Chemical speciation; EC50; Heavy metal; Microalgae growth inhibition; Mixtures; Toxicity","Algae; Biochemistry; Chemical speciation; Copper; Decision making; Heavy metal compounds; Heavy metals; Metal ions; Metals; Microorganisms; Mixtures; Pollution; Toxicity; Chemical and biologicals; EC50; Ecotoxicological tests; Growth inhibition; Metal bioavailability; Natural environments; Pollutant mixtures; Pollution management; River pollution; Animalia; Raphidocelis subcapitata"

Secondly, the reflective mirror with a shorter optical path is modified to a curved lens to compensate for the OPD.

In this work, two multi-effect VMD (ME-VMD) systems, first-stage heating and inter-stage heating processes with n one-stage-VMD units cascaded together, were firstly considered and compared in terms of efficiency using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The inter-stage heating ME-VMD system had a relatively high water recovery, however, its gained output ratio (GOR) was low and the system complexity and operating cost increased due to the presence of the heaters in each stage. Thus, we focused on the first-stage heating ME-VMD system. An ME-VMD system containing 30 one-stage VMD units with first-stage heating was then evaluated coupling with the mathematic model of single module via CFD, and an economic evaluation model was established. The effects of feed inlet temperature and stage number on the distillate flux, water recovery and GOR were comprehensively discussed. The highest GOR could reach to 12.1. The water production cost mainly depended on the heat exhaustion and the lowest cost was estimated at $0.59/t for an optimal four-stage ME-VMD system with first-stage heating, which can be competitive to the reverse osmosis technique. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","GOR; Hollow fiber; Mathematic model; Multi-effect vacuum membrane distillation (ME-VMD); Water product cost",

The effects of different pre-oxidation temperature, carrier gas flow and oxygen volume fraction on the destruction of the caking property were investigated. The distribution of the pyrolysis products, tar composition and gasification reaction reactivity were analyzed using the selected instruments and calculated by mathematic models. The experimental results showed that the weight loss of the raw coal (ZC) and the demineralized coal (ZC-D) increased gradually, with that of ZC-D always higher than that of ZC under same experimental conditions. When the caking index of ZC decreased from 90.05 to 57.88, the heavy tar content decreased from 53.79% to 42.51%, while the light tar content increased from 46.21% to 57.49%, which indicates that the pre-oxidation effectively reduced its caking property and accelerated the release of the volatile matter from coal particles. After pre-oxidation, the specific surface area, average pore diameter and total pore volume of char increased, which improved the gasification reactivity of char as the destruction of caking property had been enhanced. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Caking bituminous coal; Caking property; Pre-oxidation; Pyrolysis; Tar composition",

In this paper, based on the assumption that the shape of the soil freezing characteristic curve is mainly dependent upon the pore-size distribution of the soil, a mathematic model for estimating the soil freezing characteristic curve is proposed. The formula has the form of an integrated frequency distribution curve, which is verified by previous researches (seven representative soil samples and six representative mineral compositions, a number of special mineral particles and soils, and unsaturated soils). By nonlinear curve fitting, the correlation coefficients are generally larger than 0.95. The proposed model is more convenient than the original empirical formulas in numerical modeling, and it can overcome the shortcoming that the original empirical formulas are not derivative at the temperatures near the freezing point. In addition, the proposed model directly expresses the relationship between residual unfrozen water content and temperature under extremely low temperature conditions. Of course, the new model and results in this study may provide a reference for the research on basic physical properties of freezing soils, and the related numerical modeling in cold regions engineering. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Freezing point; Pore-size distribution; Soil freezing characteristic curve; Unfrozen water",

Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) has been selected as case study, since this protein is a common allergen of bovine meat and whey proteins, responsible for several allergic cross-reactions. BSA has been hydrolyzed with α-chymotrypsin and trypsin under high pressure (pressure level: 100–600 MPa; temperature: 37 °C; hydrolysis time/holding time: 0–25 min). For each set of experimental conditions the hydrolysis degree (HD) has been determined. A zero-order hydrolysis reaction in competition with a simultaneous second order enzyme inactivation reaction have been considered to represent the hydrolysis under pressure, and a mathematic model has been set up to fit the experimental data of HD as a function of the reaction time. The non-linear mathematical model fits the experimental data properly. This substantiated the theoretical approach utilized to represent the reaction's kinetics taking place during enzymatic hydrolysis under pressure. The reaction rate constant and enzyme inactivation constant increased with the pressure level, confirming that high pressure enhances the hydrolysis reaction rates and inactivates the proteolytic enzymes. © 2017","BSA; Enzymes; High pressure; Hydrolysis; Modelling; Protein","Antigen-antibody reactions; Body fluids; Enzymes; Hydrolysis; Hydrostatic pressure; Kinetics; Mammals; Models; Proteins; Rate constants; Reaction kinetics; Reaction rates; Surface plasmon resonance; Alpha chymotrypsins; Bovine serum albumins; Enzyme inactivation; Experimental conditions; Experimental evidence; High hydrostatic pressure; High pressure; Theoretical approach; Enzymatic hydrolysis"

The Seveso incident brought to attention some critical issues, such as lack of knowledge on runaway reaction scenarios, hazards of formation of dioxins, lack of regulatory requirements, poor communication and coordination, and little or no emergency response or evacuation plans. Regulations related to process safety and risk management have evolved with time as compared to earlier when there were no specific regulations for controls of such major hazards as became evident during the Seveso incident. Meanwhile, the third improved version of the EU Directive inspired by the incident has been implemented. Although in general over the years occupational safety has vastly improved, major losses have still occurred and in fact formed the motivation to issue the new versions of the Directive. This paper highlights two limitations of the Seveso III Directive – lack of implementation of leading indicators and limited application of hazard and risk identification (for example little or no consideration of the hazards of intermediate products). Some existing gaps like lack of learning from previous incidents, scale-up issues, limitations of experiments related to real scenarios (e.g., vapour cloud explosion), uncertainties involved in complex systems and their gradual degradation by their use are described. These gaps necessitate developing and using advanced methods and an holistic approach such as resilience and advanced mathematic-statistical methods to resolve these issues. This work presents a resilience-based analysis of the Seveso incident and lays the foundation for development of a Process Resilience Analysis Framework. Implementation of this framework would advance current risk assessment and management techniques through integration of technical and social factors. The paper concludes with some cardinal rules for a systems approach to risk management and the significance of risk governance. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Accident prevention; EU safety regulation; EU Seveso Directives; Resilience; Risk management; System approach","Accident prevention; Coordination reactions; Explosions; Hazards; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Analysis frameworks; Intermediate product; Regulatory requirements; Resilience; Risk assessment and managements; Safety regulations; System approach; Vapour cloud explosions; Occupational risks"

In this study, firstly we established a theory for describing the coagulation kinetics, and then the coagulation rates of variably charged hematite colloidal particles measured by laser light scattering under different pH conditions were employed to verify the established theory. The results showed that, by employing the pH dependent activation energy of variably charged particle's coagulation, we successfully established the theory to describe the coagulation kinetics of variably charged nanoparticles under different pH conditions; and the established theory has been well approved by the experiments. The established theory quantitatively show how the solution conditions of temperature, pH and electrolyte concentration, and how the particle natures of surface area per particle, point of zero charge (PZC) and van der Waals interaction force influence the coagulation rate of variably charged particles. Based on the established equation for describing hematite coagulation, we successfully predicted the coagulation rates change with pH for the hematite coagulation, and the predictions meet the experimental data very well.

To facilitate rational bioprocess development and reactor design, we present an overall modeling concept for a continuous operating mode that addresses both limitations.

In this context, an (initial) enzyme inactivation rate ki 0 caused by factors other than H2O2 (e.g. the used buffer system) was introduced.

A mathematic model based on the Avrami equation has been established to describe the DRX behavior of the alloy, with the volume fractions of DRX grains calculated by the model in good agreement to that of the experimental results. © 2017","Avrami equation; Critical strain model; Dynamic recrystallization; Ti-47Al-2Nb-2Cr alloy","Aluminum; Chromium alloys; Deformation; Dynamic recrystallization; Dynamics; Grain boundaries; Microstructure; Niobium; Powder metallurgy; Stress-strain curves; Avrami equations; Cr alloys; Critical strains; Micro-structural characterization; Micro-structure evolutions; Microstructure characterization; True stress strain curve; Zener-Hollomon parameter; Strain rate"

However, the excessive computational cost produced by repetitively extreme value analysis severely influences the practical application of evidence theory. This paper aims to develop an efficient algorithm for epistemic uncertainty analysis of acoustic problem under evidence theory. Based on the orthogonal polynomial approximation theory, a numerical approach named as the evidence-theory-based Jacobi expansion method (ETJEM) is proposed. In ETJEM, the response of acoustic system with evidence variables is approximated by Jacobi expansion, through which the repetitively extreme value analysis needed in evidence theory can be efficiently performed. The parametric Jacobi polynomial of Jacobi expansion holds a large number of polynomials as special cases, such as the Legendre polynomial and Chebyshev polynomial. Thus, the ETJEM permits a much wider choice of polynomial bases to control the error of approximation than the traditional evidence-theory-based orthogonal polynomial approximation method, in which only the Legendre polynomial is used for approximation. Three numerical examples are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, including a mathematic problem with explicit expression and two engineering applications in acoustic field. In these three numerical examples, efficiency and accuracy are fully studied by comparing with Legendre expansion method as well as Monte Carlo simulations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Acoustic system; Epistemic uncertainty; Evidence theory; Gauss–Jacobi integration formula; Jacobi expansion; Uniformity approach","Acoustic fields; Approximation theory; Computation theory; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Numerical methods; Orthogonal functions; Polynomial approximation; Polynomials; Probability distributions; Value engineering; Acoustic systems; Chebyshev polynomials; Engineering applications; Epistemic uncertainties; Evidence theories; Extreme value analysis; Orthogonal polynomial approximations; Uniformity approach; Uncertainty analysis"

With the aim to obtain the multi-annuli behavior of the transient temperature increase in subsea wells, mathematic models of heat transfer in the wellbore and multi-annuli are established. The wellbore is divided into different sections vertically from the bottom to the wellhead according to the amount of annuli considering the different processes of heat transfer in various sections. And the finite difference method and the Crank Nicolson scheme are used to solve the partial differential equations. As the traditional semisteady-state method doesn't take into account the transient heat transfer from wellbore fluid to the annuli, we demonstrate that the temperature of the multi-annuli is highly over-estimated at the early stage of production. Compared to the traditional semisteady-state method, our transient method reveals the temperature increase performance of the multi-annuli at the initial stage of production. Given that the production rate is an important factor that affects the temperature of the multi-annuli, we present the relationship between the temperature in the annuli and the production rate. It turns out that the temperature in the annuli rises significantly when improving the production rate. So knowing how the production rate influences the temperature in the annuli is beneficial to making an appropriate production plan and sustaining production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Annular pressure; The Crank Nicolson; The finite difference; The transient method; The wellbore heat transfer",

However, various uncertainties may significantly influence the reliability of St-Id. This paper presents ambient vibration measurements to develop a baseline model for a newly constructed arch bridge over Hongshui River in Guangxi, China. In this study, modal parameter identification was performed using the random decrement (RD) technique together with the complex mode indicator function (CMIF) algorithm, and the results were compared with those from stochastic subspace identification (SSI). First, a three-dimensional (3D) finite-element (FE) model was constructed to obtain the analytical frequencies and mode shapes. Then, the FE model of the arch bridge was tuned to minimize the difference between the analytical and experimental modal properties. Three artificial intelligence algorithms were used to calibrate uncertain parameters: the simple genetic algorithm (SGA), the simulated annealing algorithm (SAA), and the genetic annealing hybrid algorithm (GAHA). The simulation results showed that GAHA exhibited the best performance in mathematic function tests among the three methods and that the large-scale arch bridge could be efficiently calibrated using a hybrid strategy that combines SGA and SAA. To verify the admissibility of the calibration procedure, a sensitivity analysis was performed for the Young's modulus of the steel members, and the relative error for the static deformation of the bridge deck was determined. Finally, to verify the accuracy of the results, a multimodel updating method based on Bayesian statistical detection was analyzed for further validation. Through a detailed St-Id study using precise modeling, operational modal analysis (OMA), and the artificial intelligence algorithms, the authors confirmed the accuracy of the updated FE model for further structural performance prediction. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Concrete-filled steel tubular arch bridge; Epistemic uncertainty; Finite-element model; Model calibration; Operational modal analysis","Arch bridges; Arches; Artificial intelligence; Concretes; Elastic moduli; Genetic algorithms; Identification (control systems); Modal analysis; Parameter estimation; Sensitivity analysis; Simulated annealing; Stochastic systems; Structural analysis; Structural health monitoring; Uncertainty analysis; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Complex mode indicator functions; Concrete filled steel tubular arch bridges; Epistemic uncertainties; Model calibration; Operational modal analysis; Simulated annealing algorithm(SAA); Stochastic subspace identification; Finite element method"

However, minority and female students remain underrepresented in the STEM fields. Therefore, it is essential that we continue to examine the potential factors that both incite and dissuade STEM interest. We apply Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) to examine STEM attitudes of predominantly low-socioeconomic status minority elementary school students over the course of a computing intervention. Furthermore, we integrate the digital inequality mental access conceptualization of ‘emotional costs’ into the EVT model in order to predict students’ negative STEM attitudes. Data are from a large-scale computing intervention that took place in a primarily minority, high poverty, urban elementary school district located in the southeastern USA. Results indicate that positive expectancies for success and subjective task values predict students’ positive STEM attitudes. Emotional costs toward technology primarily predict negative STEM attitudes. Students’ expectancies/values and emotional costs may have a ‘push-and-pull’ effect on the formation of STEM attitudes. This study successfully links digital disparities to STEM disparities by integrating the digital inequality concept of emotional costs. Practically, we conclude that future computing interventions should increase students’ academic-related expectancies and values while also minimizing their emotional costs in order to address both digital and STEM inequalities. Theoretically, we conclude that broad conceptualizations of emotional costs should be included in future studies to help explain negative attitudes/motivations toward STEM-related topics. © 2017 The Author(s).

The mathematic models of three-dimensional thermal hydraulic and stress analysis were introduced. The numerical simulation of thermal-hydraulic mixing was carried out using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method under SBLOCA scenario. It was found that the temperature distribution in RPV downcomer depended on the injection velocity relative to cross-flow greatly. The RPV cooling center region was moving up with the increase of injection velocity. The temperature distribution was non-uniform along the circumferential orientation on RPV wall and the great temperature gradient was generated between the cooling center and other regions. The AP1000 RPV stress analysis was performed using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method following thermal-hydraulic mixing study.

Tracers can be introduced into the metal or solution for research purposes. In this work, the impurities in the anodized metal and the main electrolyte anions are also considered as tracers, if their content in the AOF is so small that a fraction of ionic current of their migration may be ignored, i.e. the entire ionic current is carried only by the main metal and oxygen ions. The tracers can migrate in the direction of oxygen ion motion or in the opposite direction.

The effect of the direction and velocity of tracer migration on their trajectory is studied within the mathematic model developed. The phenomenon of oxide flow, which was discovered in the works of Garcia-Vergara, Skeldon, Thompson, Habazaki, is explained within a concept that the oxide flow is a result of oxide growth in the direction normal to the substrate and the migration of basic ions in the radial direction in the strong spherical electric field with no considerable effect of mechanical stresses.

For integrated system analysis, a new algorithm dependant on engine inlet mass flow rate and pressure is considered. Using the suggested algorithm, it is possible to evaluate engine component operation, similar to the known initial parameters during hot fire test of the engine on stand. As a case study, the reusable Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) has been selected and the simulation has been performed to predict engine's throttled operation at 109 percent of the nominal thrust value. For this purpose the engine actual flow diagram has been converted to 34 numerical modules and the engine has been modelled by solving a total of 101 steady state mathematic equations. The mean error of the simulation results is found to be less than 5% compared with the published SSME data. Using the presented idea and developed modules, it is possible to build up the numerical model and simulate other LPREs. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"Aerospace engineering; Boosters (rocket); Computer software; Engines; Equations of state; Flammability testing; Liquid propellants; Propellants; Rocket engines; Rockets; Software design; Space shuttles; Engine components; Initial parameter; Integrated systems; Liquid propellant rocket engine; Mass flow rate; MATLAB/ SIMULINK; Modular simulation; Reusable space shuttles; MATLAB"

However, the central sinking of specimens is usually a major defect during the multistage negative incremental forming process. In this study, three materials (1060 aluminum, Q235, and DC04 steel) were used separately to fabricate specimens with different heights and to study the effect of materials on dimensional accuracy of parts formed. Meanwhile, the effect of stepping rates on the largest error was investigated. In addition to this, a mathematic model was proposed to predict the central sinking value of specimens based on the law of energy conservation.

Several parts processed at Stage one according to classical job-shop scheduling are grouped into a single construction component at the second welding stage. Fabrication of the construction component cannot begin until all comprising parts have been completed at Stage one. This paper establishes a novel mathematic model to minimise the total makespan by mainly considering the dominance relationship between the construction component and the corresponding parts. In order to solve this two-stage problem, we propose an improved harmony search algorithm. A local search method is applied to the best vector at each iteration, so that a more optimal vector can be subsequently realised. The average value, minimum value, relative percentage deviation and standard deviation are discussed in the experimental section, and the proposed local best harmony search algorithm outperforms the genetic algorithm, immune algorithm and harmony search algorithm without local search. Moreover, six optimal solutions are given as Gantt charts, which vividly illustrate that the mathematical model established in this paper can facilitate the development of a better scheduling scheme. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","construction component manufacturing; harmony search algorithm; job-shop scheduling; local search; makespan","Genetic algorithms; Job shop scheduling; Learning algorithms; Local search (optimization); Manufacture; Optimization; Scheduling; Welding; Component manufacturing; Dominance relationships; Experimental section; Harmony search algorithms; Improved harmony search algorithms; Local search; Makespan; Relative percentage deviations; Iterative methods"

In this paper, a series of laboratory seepage experiments were conducted to study the permeability of CS considering different gradations and void ratios. Experimental results exhibit very good relationships between the coefficient of permeability and void ratio, uniformity coefficient, coefficient of curvature and grain size of CS.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes an ontology-based model named design change analysis model to organize the unstructured design properties as a basis for design change management. Design change analysis model is constructed by formalizing the mechanical design specifications in the form of design property network. Benefiting from the fine-grained organization, design change analysis model ensures the objectivity and accuracy of design change impact assessment. Since design change analysis model satisfies the attributions of small-world network, the change impact assessment should focus on more meaningful aspects including the linkage weight, node degree, and long-chain linkages of design change analysis model. With design change analysis model, the changeability of each design property which provides a quantified change propagation measurement could be evaluated. Additionally, different components could be distinguished in design change analysis model by using clustering algorithms without specializing them in advance. Design change analysis model modeled in web ontology language is a semantic enrichment model. It supports the semantic design change management due to the mathematic logic-based semantics of web ontology language and semantic web rule language.

For nonorthogonal joint diagonalization based on the weighted least-squares criterion, the algorithms may converge to trivial (zero) solution. Certainly, the trivial solution can simply be avoided by adopting some constraint on the diagonalizing matrix or penalty terms. However, free of zero solution is not enough, especially for the blind signal separation (BSS). Actually, ill-conditioned diagonalizer even though nonzero makes the objective function unstable or even divergence in the process optimization. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent the iterative solutions from degenerating ill-conditioned forms. To solve this problem, a novel nonleast-squares criterion for non-orthogonal joint diagonalization is proposed. It is imposed constrainted terms on diagonalizers, which are induced form the mathematic define of the ill condition matrix. Finally, Computer simulations indicate that the new algorithm yields diagonalizers which not only minimize the diagonalization error but also have as small condition numbers as possible, meanwhile, degenerate solutions are avoided strictly. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Blind signal separation; Constrained terms; Dual-matrix method; Joint diagonalization","Iterative methods; Number theory; Optimization; Blind Signal Separation; Constrained terms; Iterative solutions; Joint diagonalization; Matrix methods; Nonorthogonal joint diagonalization; Objective functions; Weighted least squares; Blind source separation"

Each video packet has respective elements (i.e. release time, deadline, processing time, and weight) to describe, in which deadline is utilized to demonstrate the time domain limitation before that to upload it successfully. In order to cope with the computation complexity of traditional scheduling algorithms in intermittent infostations scenario, time-capacity mapping method is exploited to transfer it to a continue scenario when classic scheduling algorithms could be utilized with lower time complexity.

In RFA, the power delivered to the tissue is a key parameter. The objective of this study was to establish a methodology for the finite element modeling of RFA with constant power. Because of changes in the electric conductivity of tissue with temperature, a nonconventional boundary value problem arises in the mathematic modeling of RFA: neither the voltage (Dirichlet condition) nor the current (Neumann condition), but the power, that is, the product of voltage and current was prescribed on part of boundary. We solved the problem using Lagrange multiplier: the product of the voltage and current on the electrode surface is constrained to be equal to the Joule heating. We theoretically proved the equality between the product of the voltage and current on the surface of the electrode and the Joule heating in the domain. We also proved the well-posedness of the problem of solving the Laplace equation for the electric potential under a constant power constraint prescribed on the electrode surface. The Pennes bioheat transfer equation and the Laplace equation for electric potential augmented with the constraint of constant power were solved simultaneously using the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Three problems for validation were solved. Numerical results were compared either with an analytical solution deduced in this study or with results obtained by ANSYS or experiments. This work provides the finite element modeling of constant power RFA with a firm mathematical basis and opens pathway for achieving the optimal RFA power.

We first formulate a cooperative market in which the brokers negotiate about their market shares (i.e., the opportunities to provision inter-domain lightpaths) and seek for a mutual agreement with Nash bargaining [1]. Then, we design a mathematical model to describe the market place as well as the brokers' behaviors in it. An effective algorithm is derived from the model to solve the Nash bargaining problem for allocating lightpath requests among the brokers. The proposed algorithm also addresses the resource collision during request provisioning and can achieve collision-free request allocation. Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness of our proposal.

Engineers and engineering educators agree that any engineering curriculum must include plenty of mathematics studies to enrich the engineer’s toolbox. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to the possible contribution of examples from engineering fields for the clarification of mathematical issues. Purpose: The current paper describes the results of a study in which examples from the discipline of electrical and electronics engineering were introduced into two mathematics study units, one on complex numbers and one on differential equations. Sample: The research population was a class of 34 students studying for a practical engineering degree in electronics. The students were divided randomly into two groups. Group A was the experimental group and group B served as a control group on the complex numbers unit; the groups switched roles for the differential equations unit. Design and method: Both groups attended the same lectures but the experimental group practiced the study unit concepts in lab experiments using basic AC circuits and integration circuits. The control group’s exercises were the standard ones – using markers and a whiteboard. The study compared the groups’ achievements. Results: The first test, given immediately after completing the complex numbers unit, showed a small, but not significant gap between the experimental (A) group’s grades – which were higher – and the control group. In a retention test on complex numbers, given a few months after completing the complex numbers unit, group A widened the achievement gap to about 16 points on average – a significant difference. After switching the roles, on the differential equation test given immediately after studying the unit, group B’s (as an experimental group) grades were slightly, but not significantly higher than the control group’s grades. Since the differential equations unit was the last topic of the course, there was no opportunity to conduct a retention test. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","Constructivism; enhancing learning; mathematics for electrical engineering; stem",

To address this problem, this paper presents an adaptive supplementary damping controller (SDC) for voltage source converter based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) by using the goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP). Compared with conventional heuristic dynamic programming (HDP), GrHDP adds a new goal representation network to generate an adaptive reward signal to achieve better mapping relationship between the system states and the control action. To compensate phase shift between the output and input signals of a complex AC/DC power system, this paper proposes a parallel phase shift channel for the GrHDP. Moreover, the proposed GrHDP-SDC is a model-free control scheme, which does not need the mathematic model of the power system and has quick online learning ability to adapt to the variation of system operating conditions. Case studies are carried out on the 10-machine 39-bus system and 16-machine 68-bus system, respectively. Compared with the conventional lead-lag SDC (LL-SDC) and HDP-SDC, simulation results show that the proposed GrHDP-SDC can always provide satisfactory damping performance over a wide range of system operating conditions and disturbances.

This results in the classical second-order reliability method (SORM) not to be applied directly. The present study is devoted to eliminating this dilemma. Firstly, universal solving methods of partial derivatives of LSF to its basic random variables are derived using finite difference principle. Secondly, the universal methods supplement SORM to substitute for Newton–Leibniz derivation method; then, an improved algorithm of SORM is developed in conjunction with Breitung’s notion. Thirdly, reliability evaluation of three examples with explicit/implicit LSF are carried out, an available constant quantity of step length coefficient is sought out in the independent standard normal space (u-space) through theoretical inference and trial. Fourthly, an extensive SORM (ESORM) that does not resort to any abstruse mathematic theories is further formulated. Fifthly, combined with numerical simulation, stability reliability degree of one excavation, of which LSF is indefinable, is analysed immediately. Therefore, a practical alternative approach of SORM for complicated geotechnical structure is constructed in the present study. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","Geotechnical structure; limit state function; partial derivative; second-order reliability method; step length coefficient","Reliability; Geotechnical structure; Limit state functions; Partial derivatives; Second-order reliability methods; Step length; Reliability analysis"

Through the reasonable platform layout, H-Bahn can be easily integrated into the existing urban transit system. With the development of urban roads, the associated rail facilities can be conveniently disassembled, moved and expanded. The track beam, circuits, communication equipment, and sound insulation screen are all installed in a box-type track beam so that the system can achieve a high level of integration and intelligence. The carriage of the modern H-banh vehicle is connected with the bogies by two hanging devices. The vehicle is always running in the box-type track beam; therefore there are less possibilities of derailment. Consequently, the key work focuses on the running stability evaluation and curve negotiation performance analysis. In order to study the factors affecting running stability, the different stiffness and damping parameters in the primary and secondary suspension system are assigned to calculate the running stability index. To begin with, the vertical and lateral mathematic -dynamics models of the vehicle are established. Moreover, based on the USA VI rail spectrum, the vertical and lateral input displacements of the rail can be developed. In addition, the time-domain acceleration responses calculated by the dynamics model are converted to the amplitude-frequency characteristic curves by the Fourier transform. Finally, the weighted Sperling index calculated by the corresponding frequency and amplitude can evaluate the vehicle running stability. From the results of the vertical running stability analysis, the vertical indexes Wz are less than 2.5 almost, so that the running stability belongs to Level 1. For analyzing the lateral vibration, the hanging device is regarded as a fixed rigid body connecting the vehicle body and bogies. From the results of lateral running stability analysis, the lateral index Wy increases with the lateral stiffness of the air spring (&lt; 2.5 × 105), and Wy is more than 3.0 at some points. In order to analyze the curve negotiation performance, the statics model describing the lateral rolling condition is established. By solving the nonlinear equations describing the statics model, the rolling angles of vehicle body are calculated in different conditions. The stiffness of air spring and centrifugal acceleration should be controlled in the limited values for improving the curve negotiation performance.

The northern limit of Lyme disease cases has also been progressing northward from the northeastern United States into southeastern Ontario. Several factors such as climate change, changes in host abundance, host and vector migration, or possibly a combination of these factors likely contribute to the emergence of Lyme disease cases in eastern Ontario. This study first determined areas of warming using time series remotely sensed temperature data within Ontario, then analyzed possible spatial-temporal changes in Lyme disease risk in eastern Ontario from 2000 to 2013 due to climate change using tick population modeling. The outputs of the model were validated by using tick surveillance data from 2002 to 2012. Our results indicated areas in Ontario where Lyme disease risk changed from unsustainable to sustainable for sustaining Ixodes scapularis (black-legged tick) populations. This study provides evidence that climate change has facilitated the northward expansion of black-legged tick populations' geographic range over the past decade. The results demonstrate that remote sensing data can be used to increase the spatial detail for Lyme disease risk mapping and provide risk maps for better awareness of possible Lyme disease cases. Further studies are required to determine the contribution of host migration and abundance on changes in eastern Ontario's Lyme disease risk. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Ixodes scapularis; Lyme disease; Mathematic population modeling; MODIS temperature product; Remote sensing","Maps; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Time series; Ixodes scapularis; Lyme disease; MODIS temperature product; Population model; Population modelling; Remote sensing data; Remotely sensed temperature; Spatial-temporal changes; Climate change"

Microscopic mechanism of CO2 EOR at extra-high water cut stage is not clear to us. Based on the characteristics of residual oil after water flooding, three types of ideal core models were designed including dead-end model, shaped island model and cluster model. The microscopic experiments were carried out in high temperature high pressure micro-visualization experiment apparatus of independent research and development. The microscopic mathematic model of CO2-water-oil interaction was established. The process of CO2 dissolution and extraction during CO2 injection at extra-high water cut stage (water cut&gt;98%) were monitored in the experiments for the first time. The microscopic mechanism of CO2 EOR on trapped oil droplets and the influence of water barrier on miscible displacement were discussed. The results from experiments and mathematic calculation conclude that water barrier should postpone and complicate miscible process between CO2 and trapped oil. No matter how thick the water film, CO2 can diffuse through the water film into the trapped oil. The higher injection pressure is, the faster CO2 diffuses into oil, the more easily miscibility is achieved. CO2 miscible displacement contributes to oil recovery largely after water flooding. CO2 EOR might benefit from the increasing of injection pressure and the full contact time between CO2 and fluid (water and trapped oil) underground in extra-high water cut reservoir. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 miscible displacement; Extra-high water cut; High temperature and high pressure; Microscopic mechanism; Visualization experiment",

The bond model developed in this paper can be used to model cemented materials. The formulation can be reduced to model pure static problems without introducing any artificial damping. In addition, omitting the elastic terms in the objective function turns the formulation into rigid bond model, which can be used for the modeling of rigid or stiffly bonded materials. The developed bond model has the advantage over the explicit DEM that large time step or displacement increment can be used. The tensile and shear strength criteria of the bond model are formulated based on the modified Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion. The torque transmission of bonds is introduced based on rolling resistance model. The loss of shear or tensile strength, or torque transmission will lead to the breakage of bonds, and turn the bond into purely frictional contact. Three simple examples are first used to validate the bond model. Numerical examples of uniaxial and biaxial compression tests are used to show its potential in modeling cemented geomaterials. Numerical results show that elastic bonds are indeed necessary for the modeling of cemented granular material under static conditions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bonded granular geomaterials; Contact dynamics; Elastic deformability; Mathematical programming",

However, the physically realistic simulation of mixed-hydrate simulation is not yet a fully solved problem. Limited quantitative laboratory data leads to the use of various ab initio, statistical mechanical, or other mathematic representations of mixed-hydrate phase behavior. Few of these methods are suitable for inclusion in reservoir simulations, particularly for systems with large number of grid elements, 3D systems, or systems with complex geometric configurations. In this work, we present a set of fast parametric relationships describing the thermodynamic properties and phase behavior of a mixed methane-carbon dioxide hydrate system. We use well-known, off-the-shelf hydrate physical properties packages to generate a sufficiently large dataset, select the most convenient and efficient mathematical forms, and fit the data to those forms to create a physical properties package suitable for inclusion in the TOUGH+ family of codes. The mapping of the phase and thermodynamic space reveals the complexity of the mixed-hydrate system and allows understanding of the thermodynamics at a level beyond what much of the existing laboratory data and literature currently offer. © 2017","CO2 hydrate; Equation of state; Methane hydrate; Mixed hydrate","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Equations of state; Hydration; Methane; Physical properties; Thermodynamics; Carbon dioxide hydrates; Department of Energy; Equation of state; Geometric configurations; Methane hydrates; Parametric relationships; Realistic simulation; Reservoir simulation; Gas hydrates"

In this study, a distributed travelling-wave-based fault-location system, which eliminates the time synchronisation and wave propagation velocity error, is introduced. This novel system is consisted of three measurement points, which are located at both ends and the mid-point of the line. At first, the measurement points, installed at both line ends, record the post-fault current data for a time interval. The measurement point, located at the mid-point, records the time tags of the three sequential wavefronts as t1, t2 and t3 separately including the initial wave and following waves reflected at both the ends. Second, by comparing fault current recorded by the three measurement points, the fault interval can be determined based on current deviation theorem. Finally, travelling-wave propagation velocity is calculated according to mathematic equation in terms of t1, 2, 3. Then, the fault point is located without the need of time synchronisation. The simulation and hardware tests match the theoretical analysis well, showing that the proposed location method provides not only high accuracy, but also good reliability. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,"Errors; Independent component analysis; Location; Reliability analysis; Synchronization; Wave propagation; Fault location systems; Following wave; Location method; Measurement points; System errors; Travelling wave fault locations; Travelling waves; Wave propagation velocities; Velocity"

ISRJ allows the single-antenna jammer to periodically sample and repeat a fraction of the intercepted signal, which reduces the sampling rate and achieves transmit-receive isolation. The coherent-jamming signal generated by ISRJ can form multiple verisimilar false targets when received and processed by the victim radar receiver. Moreover, some false targets can precede the real target. This paper surveys the use of ISRJ in linear frequency modulated (LFM) radar jamming. The theory and application of ISRJ has been researched for more than one decade, but what is missing is a completed summary for the framework of this technique. In this paper, mathematic principles of ISRJ against LFM radars, which utilize matched-filter processing, stretch processing, and range-Doppler processing, are developed. The unique jamming effects in radar systems are focused on when the interrupted sampling frequency of the jammer is smaller than the bandwidth of the radar signal. Specifically, the false-target characteristics, including amplitude, space distribution, and phase, are discussed, respectively. On this basis, the key jamming elements, which determine these false-target characteristics, are pointed out and analyzed in detail. At last, simulation and real data are used to verify the correctness of the analyses. Experimental results highlight the potential application of the proposed jamming mode. © 1965-2011 IEEE.","Interrupted-sampling repeater; jamming; multiple false targets; wideband radar","Chirp modulation; Matched filters; Pattern matching; Radar; Radar signal processing; Radar systems; Signal receivers; Signal sampling; False targets; Filter processing; Linear frequency modulated; Repeater jamming; Sampling frequencies; Space distribution; Stretch processing; Wide band radar; Jamming"

RGB imagery is used for the generation of a georeferenced 3D point cloud through digital image preprocessing, photogrammetric and computer vision algorithms. The point cloud is complemented with temperature values measured by the thermographic sensor and with intensity values derived from the RGB data in order to obtain a multidimensional product (5D: 3D geometry plus temperature and intensity on the visible spectrum). A segmentation workflow based on the proper integration of several state-of-the-art geomatic and mathematic techniques is applied to the 5D product for the detection and sizing of thermal pathologies and geometric defects in the mounting in the PV panels. It consists of a three-step segmentation procedure, involving first the geometric information, then the radiometric (RGB) information, and last the thermal data. No configuration of parameters is required. Thus, the methodology presented contributes to the automation of the inspection of PV farms, through the maximization of the exploitation of the data acquired in the different spectra (visible and thermal infrared bands). Results of the proposed workflow were compared with a ground truth generated according to currently established protocols and complemented with a topographic survey. The proposed methodology was able to detect all pathologies established by the ground truth without adding any false positives. Discrepancies in the measurement of damaged surfaces regarding established ground truth, which can reach the 5% of total panel surface for the visual inspection by an expert operator, decrease with the proposed methodology under the 2%.

Methods: The mathematic model included biphasic patient radionuclide retention. The extrathyroidal component was a cylindric volume with a diameter corresponding to the patient's size and included patient self-absorption, whereas the thyroidal component was a point source whose transmission was reduced by self-absorption. A separate model in which the thyroid, extrathyroid, and bladder compartments fed serially from one to the next was developed to depict the radionuclide levels within the patient and to estimate the activity entering the environment at each urination. Results: The system was organized into a set of 4 workbooks: the first to be used with ablation patients prepared using thyrogen, the second with ablation patients prepared by deprivation, the third with hyperthyroid patients, and the fourth with the unusual hyperthyroid patient who finds the restrictions to be oppressive and returns 5-10 d after administration for a measurement and reassessment. The workbooks evaluated the radiation field strength external to the patient and indicated restrictions based on selected dose limits. To assist physicians in suggesting contamination precautions, the workbooks also evaluated the radioactivity present within the patient and the estimated discharge into the environment as a function of time.

In order to model the effect of plastic deformation on the magnetic properties, the prevailing Jiles-Atherton (J-A) theory is extensively used. However, the J-A models in a series of papers published by Jiles et al. are not completely consistent. As a result, there exists no uniform formula of magneto-plastic model established by different researchers, based on different J-A models, and various versions given by different mathematic expressions of magneto-plastic model often create difficulty in discriminating the accuracies and effectivenesses of the analyzed results. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an accurate and reasonable magneto-plastic model. In this paper, on the basis of magnetization mechanism of ferrimagnet and plastic deformation model, the effects of plastic deformation on the magnetic characteristic parameters adopted in magneto-plastic model, such as dislocation density, pinning coefficient and scaling constant, are analyzed and the relationship between them is first established. Then, by contrasting the fitting formula of the anhysteretic magnetization curve, the energy conservation equation and the effective magnetic field equation established by different researchers, several queries are proposed, and the irrationality and inaccuracy of the existing magneto-plastic model are elucidated, such as the mixing of anhysteresis magnetization and magnetization, the unreasonably regarding the irreversible magnetization energy as actual total magnetization energy. Thus, the energy conservation equation, the effective magnetic field equation and the anhysteretic magnetization equation are modified, and the differential expression of the magneto-plastic model is re-derived finally. Comparing the results calculated by the existing magneto-plastic models with the experimental results, it is seen indeed that a more sharp change of magnetization appears at small plastic deformation, then, the values of magnetization decrease more slowly with the increase of plastic deformation than those from the models respectively proposed by Li Jian-Wei, Leng Jian-Cheng and Wang Zheng-Dao; the saturation magnetization and residual magnetization decrease with the increase of plastic deformation, the coercive force is increased oppositely and the trend to reach the saturation magnetization becomes gentler, which is more exactly consonant with experiment observation than that calculated by the Sablik's model; additionally, the hysteresis loops of the plastically deformed carbon-steel samples calculated by the modified magneto-plastic model are also in better agreement with the experimental results than those from the existing models. Consequently, the modification is effective, and the modified magneto-plastic model is more accurate to simulate the plastic deformation effect on the magnetic property of ferromagnetic material. © 2017 Chinese Physical Society.","Hysteresis loop; Jiles-Atherton model; Magneto-mechanical effect; Magneto-plastic model","Carbon; Curve fitting; Energy conservation; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Hysteresis; Hysteresis loops; Magnetic fields; Magnetic materials; Magnetic properties; Magnetism; Magnetization; Plastic deformation; Anhysteretic magnetization; Energy conservation equations; Irreversible magnetization; Jiles Atherton model; Magneto-mechanical effects; Modified jiles-atherton models; Plastic deformation model; Plastic models; Saturation magnetization"

The relative proportion of cyanidin-based (cyanidin- and peonidin-derivatives) and delphinidin-based (delphinidin-, malvidin- and petunidinderivatives) anthocyanins largely determines the color variation among red/purple/blue colored grape varieties. Anthocyanin biosynthesis is under complex regulation by nutrients, hormones, and environmental cues sensed by the berry. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying these regulations are poorly understood. A dynamic model was developed to simulate the developmental anthocyanin composition in two genotypes and different carbon and nitrogen conditions. This model describes the flux partitioning by basic chemical reaction rules with total anthocyanin as input and reaction rates as parameters. Data were gathered from two experiments, which studied the developmental changes in anthocyanin composition. The model was calibrated for two cultivars under a given growth condition and then validated by applying the model to other conditions for the same cultivar. The model can successfully simulate all the observed modifications in anthocyanin composition throughout berry ripening. This provides an alternative way of phenotyping by dissecting a complicated trait (anthocyanin content and composition) into developmentally stable traits (model parameters).","Climate change; Color pigment; Fruit model; Fruit quality; Vitis",

The application of the cooling ceiling+fresh air system to land building has been studied more frequently; however, very few investigations have been conducted on its application to the ship cabin. Therefore, the physical model of applying cooling ceiling and fresh air systems in different forms to ship conference rooms is established, in order to further analyze the fresh air supply mode that should be adopted in the application of cooling ceiling to ship conference room. Four fresh air supply modes for comparison include air supply by twist outlet, lateral air supply, air supply by round flat wind distributor, as well as displacement ventilation. In addition, the experimental study is also utilized to verify the reliability of the round flat wind distributor's air supply mathematic model. On this basis, indoor airflow distribution during the application of cooling ceiling and four different air supply modes is numerically simulated. Meanwhile, indoor temperature gradients along with predicted mean vote and predicted percentage of dissatisfied, air exchange efficiency and other indicators of different air supply modes are comparatively analyzed. The analytic hierarchy process is also used to comprehensively evaluate four air supply plans in the ship conference room applying cooling ceiling. According to the results, the displacement ventilation is the air supply mode that boasts the best comprehensive performance indicators, including thermal comfort, air supply efficiency, sewage discharge efficiency, and so on.

The controllable artificial gravity is generated using a two-dimensional (2D) spin coating method. In order to conduct these studies a 2D spin coater was designed and manufactured. The mathematics of particle motion in fluids (Stokes’ Law) is investigated in order to analyze the motion of air-bubbles along the thickness of the film. The mathematic of particle motion in fluids is simulated using MATLAB in a wide range of variation of related parameters. These simulations illustrate that increasing the artificial gravity acceleration increases the velocity of air-bubbles motion and decreases the decay time of the air-bubble release. Simulations also show that the fluid viscosity and size of air-bubbles are effective factors which can affect the decay time of air-bubble release and their velocity along the thickness of the film. To investigate the simulation results, a high viscous photoresist (SU8-3050) is used as the coating material. The mentioned photoresist is coated with the both conventional and 2D spin coating methods and their results are compared.

The capsule successfully gathered and transmitted the pressure data to a receiver outside the body. The measured pressure signals in the animal test were analyzed in the time and frequency domains, and a mathematic model was presented to describe the different factors influencing the contact pressure.

Effects of liquid absorption and swelling on the permeability of natural fiber fabrics in LCM were investigated. It shows that the saturated permeability measured in the corn syrup is 23.1%–69.5% smaller than that in the motor oil because of reduced porosity and flow paths caused by liquid absorption and swelling. Based on traditional models by considering the effects of liquid absorption and swelling of jute fibers, a mathematic model was developed to predict the variable permeability during the mold filling. Experimental results demonstrate excellent agreement with the prediction. The effects of flow rate and fiber volume fraction on permeability were also analyzed. It is found that liquid absorption and swelling may dominate the permeation when the flow rate is low while the flow rate may contribute more when it is large. Furthermore, fiber volume fraction is more sensitive to permeability in the syrup than is the case in the motor oil because of the absorption and swelling of natural fibers. POLYM.

However, there is lack of knowledge on how to apply PAA in a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS), and whether the application of PAA at low concentration can affect fish welfare. In the present study, PAA was applied in a pilot-scale carp (Cyprinus carpio) RAS (comprised of a fish culture tank of 1 m3, a reservoir tank of 600 L and a filter complex of 400 L) every 3 or 4 days for 5 weeks, and the stress response of fish was monitored during every second PAA application by measuring cortisol in water. Results showed that the increase of water cortisol became less pronounced and the decrease of water cortisol occurred earlier after repeated applications of PAA, which indicates an adaptation of the stress response to PAA in the carp. Moreover, the mathematic model showed that the equal distribution of PAA in RAS was a slow progress, which depended on tanks size and flow rate. To avoid potential harm to the biofilter in RAS during PAA application, it's suggested that PAA should be applied only to the fish culture tank at a reduced flow rate. Statement of relevance Fish welfare becomes more and more important in aquaculture. However, there is a lack of knowledge if routine prophylaxis/disinfectant might affect fish welfare. In the present study, we tested how fish responded to repeated applications of peracetic acid (PAA) in a pilot-scale recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) via measurement of cortisol in water. The results showed that fishes reduced their stress during subsequent PAA application, indicating adaptation of fish to repeated prophylaxis/disinfection with PAA. Moreover, we established a model and measured the PAA concentration onsite to investigate the distribution of PAA in RAS. We found out that by simply adding PAA only to the fish culture tank with a reduced flow rate can avoid the potential harm on the biofilter.

In this paper, a new method for adaptive feedrate planning is proposed for parametric tool path with respecting geometric and kinematic constraints for CNC machining. The mathematic relationships between the prescribed constraints and tool tip feedrate are first formulated. Then the feedrate upper bound at any curve parameter is derived, and the tool path is adaptively discretized into discrete sampling positions and corresponding maximum feedrates are calculated. A linear mathematic model for linear programming is proposed to obtain the optimal square values of feedrates at each sampling position. After solving the linear model by a well-developed linear programming algorithm, the optimal feedrates at each sampling position can be calculated. Finally, the optimal discrete feedrate data are fitted to a smooth spline curve as the ultimate feedrate profile, which respects all prescribed constraints. Experiments are conducted on two parametric tool paths to show the merits of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method are feasible and applicable, the generated feedrate profiles of the two tool paths respect all the prescribed constraints. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.","CNC machining; Feedrate; Interpolator; NURBS; Parametric curve","Interpolation; Kinematics; Cnc machining; Feedrate; Interpolator; NURBS; Parametric curve; Linear programming"

In such a case, at the connecting points of two fitted segments, there may be discontinuity or non-smoothness. In this paper, a global cam fitting algorithm based on the nonlinear least squares method is proposed. A circular arc cam is represented by the mathematic function in terms of form, rotation and position parameters. By imposing parameter constraints, a closed and smooth profile can be obtained as the result of fitting. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, the uncertainties of the fitted parameters are estimated by the GUM uncertainty framework and Monte Carlo simulations.

It relies on increasing index contrast to shorten its length. However, index contrast is limited for technology. In addition, an overlarge index contrast leads to some disadvantages, such as large scattering loss, reflection loss, and small tolerance for manufacturing. Thus, an approximate scheme to design a mode converter is manipulating the transverse distribution of index to achieve the minimum length when the index contrast is given. We have analytically deduced the theoretical maximum coupled efficiency in periodic waveguide, which determines the minimum coupling length of mode converter. What is more, we have demonstrated how to construct a distribution function of indices in a cross section of waveguide to achieve the minimum length and a case is also given to illustrate the process.

Lightweight design method has been applied to reduce weight and increase material efficiency of extrusion dies at design stage. However, the research work was often focused on weight reduction with function requirements as the design constricts. Environmental impacts (EIs) over the entire life cycle of dies are not considered, as a result, it may result in environmental burdens being shifted from design stage to other stages of life cycle of products. Aiming at it, a new lightweight design method is proposed to integrate life cycle assessment (LCA) with shape optimization. The optimization mathematic models for the proposed method are developed, in which the EIs of extrusion dies are modeled as a function of shape variables and processing parameters. An example of extrusion dies for plastic pipe was presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results showed that 13% weight reduction whist achieving reduction in EIs over the life cycle of dies in comparison with 18% weight reduction yet 29% increase in EIs at manufacturing stage and resultant increase in EIs over the life cycle using conventional lightweight design method in which EIs are not taken into account.

The NNRPIM combines the radial point interpolators (RPI) with the natural neighbour geometric concept. The nodal connectivity and the background integration mesh depend entirely on the nodal discretization and are both achieved using mathematic concepts, such as the Voronoï diagram and the Delaunay tessellation. The obtained interpolation functions, used in the Galerkin weak form, are constructed with the RPI and possess the delta Kronecker property, which facilitates the imposition of the natural and essential boundary conditions. Due to the organic procedure employed to impose the nodal connectivity, the obtained displacement and the stress field are smooth and accurate. Since the scope of this work is to extend and validate the NNRPIM in the anisotropic elasto-plastic analysis, it is used as nonlinear solution algorithm, the modified Newton–Raphson initial stiffness method. The efficient “backward-Euler” procedure is considered to return the stress to the Hill anisotropic yield surface. The elasto-plastic algorithm of solution is described.

For the past forty years the research on this subject stayed in the stage of qualitative estimate. In recent few years the 3D dynamic faulting theory provided a quantitative solution of this subject. The theory deduced a quantitative calculating formula for the crustal GPE change using the mathematic method of tensor analysis under the principal stresses system. This formula contains only the vertical principal stress, rupture area, slip, dip, and rake; it does not include the horizontal principal stresses. It is just involved in simple mathematical operations and does not hold complicated surface or volume integrals. Moreover, the hanging wall vertical moving (up or down) height has a very simple expression containing only slip, dip, and rake. The above results are significant to investigate crustal GPE change. Commonly, the vertical principal stress is related to the gravitational field, substituting the relationship between the vertical principal stress and gravitational force into the above formula yields an alternative formula of crustal GPE change. The alternative formula indicates that even with lack of in situ borehole measured stress data, scientists can still quantitatively calculate crustal GPE change. The 3D dynamic faulting theory can be used for research on continental fault earthquakes; it also can be applied to investigate subduction earthquakes between oceanic and continental plates. Subduction earthquakes hold three types: (a) crust only on the vertical up side of the rupture area; (b) crust and seawater both on the vertical up side of the rupture area; (c) crust only on the vertical up side of the partial rupture area, and crust and seawater both on the vertical up side of the remaining rupture area. For each type we provide its quantitative formula of the crustal GPE change. We also establish a simplified model (called CRW Model) as follows: for Type B and Type C subduction earthquakes, if the seawater average depth on the vertical up side of the rupture area is less than a tenth of the hypocenter depth, then take the approximation that the seawater above the continental plate is replaced by the upper crustal material of the continental plate. The formula of quantitative calculating the crustal GPE change is also provided for this model. Finally, for 16 September 2015 Mw 8.3 Illapel Chile earthquake, we apply CRW Model and obtain the following results: the crustal GPE change is equal to 1.8 × 1019 J, and the hanging wall vertical moving-up height is 1.9 m with respect to the footwall. We believe this paper might be the first report on the quantitative solution of the crustal GPE change for this subduction earthquake; our results and related method will be helpful in research into the earthquakes in Peru–Chile subduction zone and the Andean orogeny. In short, this study expounds a new method for quantitative determining the crustal GPE change caused by subduction earthquakes, which is different from other existing methods. © 2017, Springer International Publishing.","continental plate; crustal GPE change; Earthquake; Nazca Plate; oceanic plate; South American Plate; subduction earthquake","Earthquakes; Geophysics; Gravitation; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Seawater; Tectonics; crustal GPE change; Gravitational potential energy; Mathematical operations; Nazca plate; Oceanic plate; Qualitative estimates; Quantitative formula; Subduction earthquakes; Faulting; crust; earthquake; gravity field; hanging wall; Nazca plate; potential energy; subduction"

It decomposes a multi-objective problem into subproblems by mathematic programming methods and applies evolutionary algorithms to optimize the subproblems simultaneously. MOEA/D is good at finding Pareto solutions which are evenly distributed. However, it can be improved for problems with discontinuous Pareto fronts (PF). Many solutions will assemble in breakpoints in this situation. A method for adjusting weight vectors for bi-objective optimization problems with discontinuous PF is proposed. Firstly, this method detects the weight vectors which need to be adjusted using a property of MOEA/D. Secondly, the reserved vectors are divided into several subsets. Thirdly, after calculating the ideal number of vectors in each subset, vectors are adjusted evenly. Lastly, the corresponding solutions are updated by a linear interpolation.

Thus, a data driven model is proposed for improving the accuracy of SOC estimation in this paper. A preliminary mathematic model under constant current is established, which can match the primary high SOC stage. Since the battery model is nonlinear, model free adaptive control (MFAC) is used to get the dynamic linearization model and accomplish SOC estimation process on the basis of the mathematic model. With the small sample scale of new data updated, a data driven model based on partial least squares (PLS) is obtained online. The accuracy of the mathematic model also decreases during the operating process. Finally, the calculated values from the two different models are mixed for an accurate SOC.

A synergistic study on CFD simulation and sample preparation with highly branched cyclic dextrin (HBCD) as an excipient matrix for dry powder inhaler formulations of tranilast (TL) were performed. Methods: The crystal form of TL in spray-dried particles was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and fluorescence spectroscopy. The aerodynamic performance of DPI formulations was assessed using the Andersen cascade impactor. CFD simulations could simulate the movement of fluids by resolving the mathematic equations governing the movement following Navier-Stokes equations. Particle behavior and deposition from CFD analysis compared with experimental data. Results: Spray-dried particles (SDPs) of TL/HBCD showed characteristic diffraction peaks differing from untreated TL crystalline in powder X-ray diffraction. The polymorphic transition of TL was also observed in a fluorescence spectrum. Cascade impactor evaluation on SDPs of TL/HBCD at a 40% ethanol ratio demonstrated high inhalation performance with a fine particle fraction of 33%, while SDPs prepared at a 30% ethanol ratio were lower than that of the others. Regarding the cause of this difference, CFD analysis revealed that high inhalation performance was related to the true density and particle size of SDPs. The change in true density of TL associated with polymorphic transition would affect the inhalation performance.

We have in-situ measured the nitriding kinetics of grain-oriented silicon steel at 750 °C in the gas mixture of N2 + H2 + NH3 using thermogravimeter (TG), and found that the kinetics could be divided into three stages. First, the weight of sample decreased until the nitriding period of 40s, indicating that no nitriding could occur but just the oxide layer on the surface be reduced. Next, the weight increased with the increasing rate until 120s, suggesting an accelerated nitriding during this period. Finally, the weight increased with a constant rate during nitriding, i.e. the nitriding with a constant rate. It was found that nitrogen atoms could diffuse into the steel matrix along the grain boundaries with the largest depth of about 50 μm during the nitriding for 590s. Moreover, the lamellar oxide particles on the surface that were formed during decarburization process transformed to the spherical ones when they were reduced by H2 during nitriding, leading to the formation of spongy oxide layer. With a reasonable assumption that the reduction kinetics of oxide layer should determine its resistance to nitriding, we have established a mathematic modeling with a properly defined boundary condition. The calculated average N content and the N-penetrating maximum depth during nitriding both show excellent agreements with the experimental measurements. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Diffusion; Grain-oriented silicon steel; Kinetics; Modeling and simulation; Nitriding","Diffusion; Enzyme kinetics; Grain boundaries; Kinetics; Low temperature production; Silicon; Silicon steel; Temperature; Grain-oriented silicon steel; In-situ measurement; Mathematic model; Model and simulation; Nitriding kinetics; Oxide particles; Quantitative modeling; Reduction kinetics; Nitriding"

However, due to the complexity of image degradation and inevitable existence of noise, the coding coefficients produced by imposing sparse prior only are not precise enough for faithful reconstructions. In order to overcome it, we present an improved SISR reconstruction method based on the proposed bidirectionally aligned sparse representation (BASR) model. In our model, the bidirectional similarities are first modeled and constructed to form a complementary pair of regularization terms. The raw sparse coefficients are additionally aligned to this pair of standards to restrain sparse coding noise and therefore result in better recoveries. On the basis of fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm, a well-designed mathematic implementation is introduced for solving the proposed BASR model efficiently. Thorough experimental results indicate that the proposed method performs effectively and efficiently, and outperforms many recently published baselines in terms of both objective evaluation and visual fidelity. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Bidirectional similarities; Single image super-resolution; Sparse coefficient alignment; Sparse representation","Iterative methods; Optical resolving power; Bidirectional similarities; Image degradation; Iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithms; Objective evaluation; Reconstruction method; Regularization terms; Single images; Sparse representation; Image coding"

The attainment of the purpose consisted of several stages: (1) to gain the subject from the mathematic education of first semester students, each of them who has a high, medium, and low competence of mathematic case. (2) To give two mathematical problems with different characteristics. The first problem (M1), the statement does not lead to a resolution. The second problem (M2), a statement leads to problem-solving. (3) To explore the behaviour of problem-solving based on the step of Polya (Rizal, 2011) by way of thinking aloud and in-depth interviews. The obtained data are analysed as suggested by Miles and Huberman (1994) but at first, time triangulation is done or data's credibility by providing equivalent problem contexts and at different times. The results show that the behavioral problem solvers (mathematic education students) who are capable of high mathematic competency (ST). In understanding M1, ST is more likely to pay attention to an image first, read the texts piecemeal and repeatedly, then as a whole and more focus to the sentences that contain equations, numbers or symbols. As a result, not all information can be received well. When understanding the M2, ST can link the information from a problem that is stored in the working memory to the information on the long-term memory. ST makes planning to the solution of M1 and M2 by using a formula based on similar experiences which have been ever received before. Another case when implementing the troubleshooting plans, ST complete the M1 according to the plan, but not all can be resolved correctly. In contrast to the implementation of the solving plan of M2, ST can solve the problem according to plan quickly and correctly. According to the solving result of M1 and M2, ST conducts by reading the job based on an algorithm and reasonability. Furthermore, when SS and SR understand the problem of M1 and M2 similar to the ST's, but both of the problem solvers read the questions with not complete so that they cannot pay attention to the questions of the problems.

Though, mesh infection is a complication that may prolong the patient recovery period and consequently presents an impact on public health economy. Such concern can be avoided thanks to a local and extended antibiotic release on the operative site. In recent developments, poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) has been used in complement of polyethyleneterephthalate (Dacron®) (PET) or polypropylene (PP) yarns in the manufacture of semi-resorbable parietal implants. The goal of the present study consisted in assigning drug reservoir properties and prolonged antibacterial effect to a 100% PLLA knit through its functionalization with a cyclodextrin polymer (polyCD) and activation with ciprofloxacin. The study focused i) on the control of degree of polyCD functionalization of the PLLA support and on its physical and biological characterization by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and cell viability, ii) on the understanding of drug/meshes interaction using mathematic model and iii) on the correlation between drug release studies in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and microbiological evaluation of meshes and release medium against E. coli and S. aureus. All above mentioned tests highlighted the contribution of polyCD on the improved performances of the resulting antibacterial implantable material. Statement of Significance 1. We managed for the first time, with well-defined parameters in terms of temperature and time of treatment, to functionalize a bio-absorbable synthetic material to improve drug sorption and drug release properties without affecting its mechanical properties. 2. We analyzed for the first time the degradation of our coating products by mass spectroscopy to show that only citrate and cyclodextrin residues (and glucose units) without any cytotoxicity are formed. 3. We managed to improve the mechanical properties of the PLA with the cyclodextrin polymer to form a composite.

Based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), a new optimizing method about semi-trailer tractor's structure parameters was put forward. By analyzing structural and dynamic characteristics of semi-trailer tractor's 2-DoF (degree of freedom) model, optimizing principles were established. According to the tractor operation performance including the manipulative stability, negative weight addition, limitation of driving wheel's load, load rate of engine power and adhesive characteristic, the constricted boundary conditions were designed. The optimizing objective functions were formulated, which included fuel economy, power performance and force status of tractive point. YTO-150 tractor and the matched semi-trailer were collected as the investigative and optimized object. According to the theoretical analysis and mathematical modeling of the tractor and trailer dynamic performance, the 4 objective functions were divided into 2 groups which involved contradictory relation. After the multiple mathematic conversions of objective functions and constraint functions, the complicated and coupled relationship between the optimal objects could be simplified. Using NSGA-II two times, the semi-trailer tractor's structure parameters and the gear ratios of transportation work condition were calculated. And relevant program was redacted. Parameters including the gravity of the tractor and semi-trailer, and the position of each part's barycenter were optimized. And the transmission ratio of each transportation gear was modified. The figure describing the Pareto front end of each aimed function was plotted. As compared with the primitive semi-trailer tractor, the total weight was declined by 6.86%, the position of the tractor's barycenter moved forward by 0.074 m, and the position of the trailer's barycenter moved backward by 0.14 m. As compared with the single objective optimizing result with the way of developing the CAD (computer aided design) systems of Delphi, the total weight was declined by 3.26%, the position of the tractor's barycenter moved backward by 0.022 m, and the position of the trailer's barycenter moved backward by 0.3 m. On 5 different gradient test ramps, the climbing performance experiment was performed. And in the climbing tractor and trailer, the velocity and pull force on the traction axle were measured by the GPS (global position system) device and resistance strain pull and pressure sensor. When the tractor was driven under the transportation gear I, the maximum climbing degree was improved by 1.35% and 1.68%, and the average force of the tractive point declined by 1 222 and 703 N, respectively, compared with the single objective optimizing scheme and primitive semi-trailer tractor. When the tractor was driven under the transportation gearⅡ, the maximum climbing degree was improved by 1.38% and 0.57%, and the average force of the tractive point declined by 2 792 and 2 125 N, respectively, compared with the single objective optimizing scheme and primitive semi-trailer tractor. The fuel economy of the tractor trailer systems was simulated by the simulator, which was developed upon the dynamic joint between AVL CRUISE and MATLAB. When the simulation adopted the marked working condition based on EUDC (extra urban driving cycle), the fuel consuming rate of the multi-objective optimized semi-trailer tractor declined by 12.9% and 15.8%, respectively, compared with the single objective optimizing scheme and primitive semi-trailer tractor. To sum up, this optimized method reaches the requirement of the objective functions, and provides the theoretical and technologic foundation for improving tractive vehicle systems. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Sixty steel samples were analyzed, with known manganese concentrations from 0.106 to 1.696 wt%.

(2013), where the problem of ill posedness in GS reconstruction has been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we present an extended Hilbert transform (EHT) over the plane rectangle. In contrast to previous one (HT over the unit circular region), corner singularities are introduced into these new formulae. It is confronted by problems like the integral with both endpoint singularities, and the semiinfinite integral with one endpoint singularity, as these EHT formulae are used to rebuild the essential technique of GS reconstruction. Two additional mathematic tools are adopted in this study. First, high-accuracy quadrature schemes are constructed for those improper integrals based on the double exponential (DE) transformations. Benchmark testing with the analytic solutions on a rectangular boundary has shown the efficiency and robustness of the EHT formulae. Second, the data completion or the inverse boundary value problem is solved with the help of a truncated Chebyshev series, which approximates the unknown boundary gradients in very high efficiency under the only assumption that they are Lipschitz continuous on each side of the rectangle. Combining the introduced EHT formulae and the two needed mathematic tools, the essential technique of GS reconstruction is formulated into a linear system of Fredholm equations of the first kind. Then a three-parameter Tikhonov regularization scheme is developed to deal with the ill-posed linear operators appearing in the discretized linear system. This new approach for data completion over the plane rectangle is benchmarked with the analytic solutions. Numerical experiments highlight the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. ©2017.

The traditional tool path generation methods only consider one or a few requirements and ignore the others due to the lack of comprehensive mathematic framework. Tool path generated in this way normally is not fully optimized since different requirements could compete or even conflict with each other. Targeting at this issue, this paper presents a unified mathematic framework based on field theory to generate tool path for both planar and freeform surface, where the three most important factors in NC machining, i.e., the smoothness, evenness, and machining efficiency of tool path can be considered. In the proposed framework, a field-based cost functional and a gradient-field-based inequality constraint functional is established, so as to convert the multi-objective tool path computation into a functional minimization problem with inequality constraints. Then, a finite element method (FEM)-based numerical method is proposed to solve the multi-variable nonlinear optimization problem. After that, two smooth tool path generation methods are proposed with taking the step-over as constraint. To further improve the machining efficiency, this paper also provides a hybrid method that combines zigzag and spiral pattern tool path. Experiments on blade machining and simulation show that the proposed method can produce smooth tool paths, while the machining efficiency can be improved at the same time. In addition to the above advantages, the proposed mathematical framework is extensible by incorporating different machining requirements into it, making it possible to generate tool path when multi-objective is considered. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.","Blade machining; Covariant field theory; Functional optimization; Step-over constraint; Tool path generation","Computation theory; Constraint theory; Efficiency; Nonlinear programming; Numerical methods; Optimization; Field theory; Functional minimization; Functional optimization; Mathematical frameworks; Non-linear optimization problems; Step-overs; Tool path computation; Tool path generation; Finite element method"

For separation of cracking C5 fraction, one of the main challenges is improving the conversion of cyclopentadiene (CPD) and the recovery of isoprene (IP). In the current work, a novel reactive distillation column with several liquid-holdup regions was designed, since it allows long residence time and provides flexibility for narrowing the efficiency gap between reaction and distillation. By use of Aspen Plus, a corresponding mathematic model was established and verified to be accurate. Following that, comprehensive studies were carried out for the design of liquid-holdup regions position. Details and principles about the separation performance with the liquid-holdup regions were revealed and optimized parameters were determined with 100 theoretical plates, feed position of 35th plate, and four liquid-holdup regions at 25th, 60th, 75th and 90th plate. The designed RD column could well meet the technical requirement, and influence of other important factors including residence time, operating pressure and reflux ratio was further investigated. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cracking C5; Cyclopentadiene; Isoprene; Liquid-holdup region; Reactive distillation","Cracks; Distillation; Isoprene; Liquids; Olefins; Separation; Cyclopentadienes; Liquid hold ups; Optimized parameter; Reactive distillation columns; Reactive distillations; Separation performance; Technical requirement; Theoretical plates; Distillation columns"

Distinctly different from the typical uranium deposits of interlayer oxidation zone type in the world, this deposit is characterized not only by the tabular or stratoid orebodies controlled by the interface between monolayer grayish green paleo-oxidized sand body and underling gray sand body but also by being far away from the roof and bottom plate. Part of the ore-hosting rocks appear macroscopically as reddish and charcoal debris-bearing ores and microscopically as special paragenetic mineral assemblages consisting of coffinite, hematite (goethite), pyrite and siderite. Based on the results of rock-mineral identifications, EMPA and acidolysis hydrocarbon decomposition analysis, combined with the results of the experiments and mathematic simulations for fluid barrier theory of uranium metallogenesis by former researcher, the authors hold that the Nalinggou uranium deposit resulted from interaction between oxidizing uraniferous brine and deep-seated reducing fluid and, furthermore, the changing of the oxidizing-reducing interface in the ore-forming process was the key factor for reddish alteration of ores, and the interactions between persistent strong oxidizing uraniferous fluid and weak deep-seated reducing fluid might have been the primary factor responsible for the formation of the tabular orebodies. © 2017, Science Press.

The main factors affecting accuracy of stereo-vision system were analyzed and the error track chain of vision system was listed, which can explain the accuracy bottleneck in vision system with large FOV. Then, laser tracker was adopted to calculate the rigid body transformation with unit quaternion method, thus achieving virtual point clouds with high precision. Subsequently, 3-order radial distortion and 2-order tangential distortion were involved in the mathematic camera distortion model. In addition, the calibration parameters were solved through Levenberg-Marquardt iterative algorithm, which can improve the accuracy moderately. In the experiment, the binocular stereo vision measuring system was designed with FOV of 4 m×3 m×2 m. The results show that the reconstruction mean error for 152 group data of lateral distances is -0.003 mm and the standard deviation is 0.08 mm in the detection of a high-precision guide rail.

Cognitive development of stunted children is compromised, but evidence about the association between height gain in late childhood and adolescent cognitive capacity is scarce. We aimed to determine the association between height gains at different ages, including late childhood, and cognitive capacity at 15-years-of-age. We conducted a prospective cohort study in a rural African setting in Southern Malawi. The study cohort was enrolled between June 1995 and August 1996. It originally comprised mothers of 813 fetuses, and the number of children born live was 767. These children were followed up until the age of 15 years. The anthropometrics were measured at one and 24-months-of-age and 15-years-of-age, and cognitive capacity of participants was assessed at 15-years-of-age with Raven's Coloured Matrices score, mathematic test score, median reaction time (RT) (milliseconds) and RT lapses. The associations between growth and the outcome measures were assessed with linear regression. Raven's Coloured Matrices score was predicted by height gain between 24 months and 15-years-of-age (coefficient 0.85, P = 0.03) and (coefficient 0.69, P = 0.06), but not by earlier growth, when possible confounders were included in the model. The association weakened when school education was further added in the model (coefficient = 0.69, P = 0,060). In conclusion, in rural Malawi, better growth in late childhood is likely to lead to better cognitive capacity in adolescence, partly through more school education. In light of these results, growth promotion should not only be limited to early childhood. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adolescent; cognitive capacity; growth; school education; stunting; undernutrition",

With application to renewable energy systems, a mathematically easy and algorithmically speedy non-singular finite-time convergent sliding mode control (NFTCSMC) based on fuzzy probabilistic neural network (FPNN) is proposed in this paper. The NFTCSMC creates finite system-state convergence time and is without singularity problem. But, when the system uncertainty bounds are overestimated or underestimated, chatter or steady-state error problems still exist in NFTCSMC. A FPNN with quick calculation and suitable for digital implementation, is thus used to overcome chattering and steady-state error problems.

There are an implicit relation between in the discriminant of plunging point, due to the past researchers ignoring or hard to give the mathematics formula on the vertical velocity distribution at the point which could not directly discrete sediment content from Froude number. With mathematic analysis on surveyed data and experiments, physical figure of vertical velocity distribution was decided by parabola.

METHODS: Fifteen subjects were recruited. The corneal images from optical coherence tomography (OCT) were imported into Matlab software. Five edge detection methods (Canny, Log, Prewitt, Roberts, Sobel) were used to identify the corneal surface. Then two manual identifying methods (ginput and getpts) were applied to identify the edge coordinates respectively. The differences among these methods were compared. Binomial curve (y=Ax2 +Bx+C), Polynomial curve [p(x)=p1xn +p2xn-1 +....+pnx+pn+1] and Conic section (Ax2 +Bxy+Cy2 +Dx+Ey+F=0) were used for curve fitting the corneal surface respectively. The relative merits among three fitting curves were analyzed. Finally, the eccentricity (e) obtained by corneal topography and conic section were compared with paired t-test. RESULTS: Five edge detection algorithms all had continuous coordinates which indicated the edge of the corneal surface. The ordinates of manual identifying were close to the inside of the actual edges. Binomial curve was greatly affected by tilt angle. Polynomial curve was lack of geometrical properties and unstable. Conic section could calculate the tilted symmetry axis, eccentricity, circle center, etc. There were no significant differences between ‘e’ values by corneal topography and conic section (t=0.9143, P=0.3760 &gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: It is feasible to simulate the corneal surface with mathematical curve with Matlab software. Edge detection has better repeatability and higher efficiency. The manual identifying approach is an indispensable complement for detection. Polynomial and conic section are both the alternative methods for corneal curve fitting. Conic curve was the optimal choice based on the specific geometrical properties. © 2017, International Journal of Ophthalmology (c/o Editorial Office).

The hydrolysis kinetics of pollock bone protein (PBP) was obtained by mathematic deduction and experimental analysis. The equation of degree of hydrolysis was as follows: DH = 2.801 ln|1 + (0.06044E0/S0−0.1005)t|, which could predict the hydrolysis process of PBP when hydrolysis condition was strictly controlled. However, the hydrolysis reaction was affected by several factors, and the predicted value may be against the experimental result. Therefore, online monitoring was necessary for obtaining the target peptides. Biosensor and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed for monitoring hydrolysis process online. Free lysine level was chosen as the monitoring factor determined by immobilized lysine oxidase electrodes. Based on the lysine biosensor and ANN, the hydrolysis monitoring model LYS-ANN was built, including 3 input layer nodes (E0, S0, and LYS), 1 output layer node (DH), and 11 hidden layer nodes. R2 value between sample value and simulation value was 0.9964. Simulation error was in the range of 0–4.56%, and the average relative error was 0.94%.

The main characteristic of carbonate acidizing is forming wormholes. Until now, there is no effective model to describe these wormholes quantitatively, because of so many affecting parameters, wormhole types and their growing randomness. There are two main parts to calculate carbonate acidizing wormholes parameters, distribution and its length of single wormhole and competition relationship between several wormholes. This is an important prerequisite to optimize the acidizing treatment design and develop such carbonate reservoir cost-effectively. To this end, several sets of core flow experiments were completed, and the actual shape of wormhole were reorganized using three dimensional computed tomography scan facility. By analyzing these wormholes, fractal characteristic was proved to be both of linear and radial flow status. Their fractal dimensions, which are key parameter for describing fractal geometry, were given then. Based on previous conclusions, fractal model of dingle wormhole equivalent length was established, which make it possible to describe wormhole considering both length and plane distribution. Secondly, in order to clarify the relationship between several different wormholes, competition mathematic model of multiple wormholes was given. After solution and simulation analysis of this model, its fractal characteristic and fractal dimension were also obtained.

Preterm-born individuals have an increased risk for both persistent cognitive impairments and long-term changes in macroscopic brain organization. We hypothesized that the association of childhood mathematic abilities with both adulthood general cognitive abilities and associated fronto-parietal intrinsic networks is altered after preterm delivery. 72 preterm- and 71 term-born individuals underwent standardized mathematic and IQ testing at 8 years and resting-state fMRI and full-scale IQ testing at 26 years of age. Outcome measure for intrinsic networks was intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC). Controlling for IQ at age eight, mathematic abilities in childhood were significantly stronger positively associated with adults’ IQ in preterm compared with term-born individuals. In preterm-born individuals, the association of children’s mathematic abilities and adults’ fronto-parietal iFC was altered. Likewise, fronto-parietal iFC was distinctively linked with preterm- and term-born adults’ IQ. Results provide evidence that preterm birth alters the link of mathematic abilities in childhood and general cognitive abilities and fronto-parietal intrinsic networks in adulthood. Data suggest a distinct functional role of intrinsic fronto-parietal networks for preterm individuals with respect to mathematic abilities and that these networks together with associated children’s mathematic abilities may represent potential neurocognitive targets for early intervention. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Fronto-parietal intrinsic networks; IQ in adulthood; Mathematic abilities in childhood; Preterm birth",

Methods Seventy-nine 9- to 11-yr-old children completed an aerobic fitness assessment using a graded exercise test; a muscular fitness assessment consisting of upper body, lower body, and core exercises; a serial n-back task to assess working memory; and an academic achievement test of mathematics and reading. Results Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that after controlling for demographic variables (age, sex, grade, IQ, socioeconomic status), aerobic fitness was associated with greater response accuracy and d′ in the 2-back condition and increased mathematic performance in algebraic functions. Muscular fitness was associated with increased response accuracy and d′, and longer reaction time in the 2-back condition. Further, the associations of muscular fitness with response accuracy and d′ in the 2-back condition were independent of aerobic fitness. Conclusion The current findings suggest the differential relationships between the aerobic and the muscular aspects of physical fitness with working memory and academic achievement. With the majority of research focusing on childhood health benefits of aerobic fitness, this study suggests the importance of muscular fitness to cognitive health during preadolescence. © Copyright 2017 by the American College of Sports Medicine.","CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS; COGNITION; PREADOLESCENCE; SCHOLASTIC PERFORMANCE; STRENGTH FITNESS","academic achievement; child; childhood; exercise test; human; human experiment; mathematics; muscle; n-back test; regression analysis; school child; working memory"

For a comparison, the study was operated in 3.5% NaCl solution and with an application of 150 MPa tensile stress as well. The electrochemical measurements of open circuit potential (OCP) and potentiodynamic polarization were used to exam the electrochemical process on the X70 steel surface under AC interference. A digital camera and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to analysis the corrosion morphology. The results show that a 30 A/m2 AC interference slightly shifted the corrosion potential -0.03 V, while a 300 A/m2 AC signal changed the value as much as -0.2 V. It was well explained with a mathematic model of AC interference. The corrosion rate increased with the AC current density in all test conditions. A corrosion mechanism was proposed to describe the occurrence of AC corrosion on the X70 steel sample surface. A net anodic current, implying an anodic dissolution, was resulted from a complete cycle of AC interference. The corrosion morphology changed from uniform corrosion to pitting corrosion under the AC interference. Thus, stray AC promoted the localized corrosion. © 2017 The Authors.","Corrosion mechanism; Corrosion morphology; Simulated marine soil solution; Stray alternating current corrosion; X70 pipeline steel",

However, conventional methods have rarely focused on the expression of geological heterogeneous properties, known as 4D modeling. A volume function is defined as a piecewise mathematic function that describes a parameterized geological property field and created by fitting the property functions of certain 3D voxels. The quadratic generalized tri-prism volume function (QGTPVF) model is proposed for representing geological property fields with a sedimentary strata structure based on the volume function method and generalized tri-prism (GTP) voxel model. A QGTPVF is designed for borehole sample points, and it interpolates geological properties by fitting quadratic volume functions combined with the influence of geological geometric structure constraints, including stratum interfaces and fault planes. This research mainly focuses on the QGTPVF definition and fitting method, single GTP volume function is a continuous quadratic function, and a property smoothing along directionally adjacent bedding GTPs method is also studied, so geological property field is also expressed by the smooth function. A preprocessing method of faults geological structures is given, and the general framework QGTPVF is also discussed for practical applications. The QGTPVF model could be converted to tetrahedron voxel and 3D grid models for calculation and analysis easily. An example on a porosity property field is studied to verify the method’s accuracy and reliability by comparing to Kriging and inverse distance weighted interpolation methods, and the result of accuracy and time complexity are better, so the QGTPVF provides a new solution for modeling geological property fields. © 2017, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Complex geological structure; Geological heterogeneous property field; Property field interpolation; Property modeling; Quadratic generalized tri-prism volume function; Volume function fitting; Voxel model",

Investigations on the survival of microorganisms in food matrices often require an artificial contamination step prior to microbial testing. Artificial contamination of low-moisture foods, like dried culinary herbs and spices, is challenging. In order to investigate the effect of several spiking techniques on the survival of Staphylococcus (S.) aureus in condiments, dried and ground paprika, pepper, and oregano were spiked with S. aureus using four different techniques: (1) aqueous bacteria suspensions were air-dried directly on the condiments; (2) aqueous bacteria suspensions were air-dried on sand, and then added to the condiments; (3) aqueous bacteria suspensions, or (4) bacteria suspended in liquid nutrient media with lyoprotectant were freeze-dried, crushed to powder, and added to the condiments. For each technique-condiment combination, and point in time, three distinct spiked samples (in three flasks) were prepared and stored in a dark environment at 24 ± 2 °C for up to 25 weeks. Cell counts directly after spiking and over storage time were analyzed. For the latter approach, mathematic models were used to fit the survival curve of each technique-condiment combination and to estimate their D-values. Results indicated that the reduction of the initial S. aureus cell counts depended on the applied spiking techniques and the used matrix. For instance, the initial cell counts in oregano were reduced by 0.8 ± 0.1 log10 cfu/g with technique 2 and by 6.1 ± 0.5 log10 cfu/g with technique 1. Technique 1 at the same time reduced the initial cell counts in paprika by only 0.4 ± 0.1 log10 cfu/g. The calculated D-values ranged from 1.3 ± 0.1 days (technique 3) to 120.1 ± 33.4 days (technique 4). The lowest as well as the highest D-value were observed for paprika samples, which emphasized the effect of the spiking technique. Thus, the behavior of bacteria can be strongly influenced by the selection of the spiking technique used for tenacity studies. Therefore, at least two spiking techniques should be considered, if the survival of microorganisms in low moisture food has to be investigated. In favor of high cell counts after drying, techniques 2 and 4 should be considered, as they performed best in our study. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Food safety; Herb; Inoculation technique; Microorganism; Spice; Tenacity",

With the higher demand for the tracking performance of electro-hydraulic force system, it is difficult for the traditional linear control strategy to meet the high-performance demand of loading system, and thus the advanced nonlinear control strategy is required urgently. To overcome the above problems, a nonlinear mathematic model, synthesized with a continuous differentiable friction model, is established. Meanwhile, a new control method, named as a robust integral of the sign of the error, is also designed based on Lyapunov stability theory. The control strategy proposed can eliminate the influence of the uncertainties of the model and guarantee asymptotic output tracking performance under the motion disturbance of aircraft actuator. Comparative experimental results are obtained to verify the high-performance of the proposed control strategy. © 2017, Press of Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

Traditionally, the shift is monitored at the peak maximum of the extinction spectrum. We demonstrate that the inflection point at the long wavelength side of the peak maximum shows better refractive index sensitivity than the peak maximum. A consistent improvement in bulk refractive index sensitivity of 18-55% is observed for six different nanoparticles such as spherical particles of different sizes, nanostar and nanorods with different aspect ratios. Local refractive index changes induced by molecular adsorption confirm the superior performance of the method. We contribute this improvement in sensitivity to the change in shape of the LSPR peak in response to an increase of the local refractive index. We further illustrate the advantage of using the inflection point method for analyzing DNA adsorption on U-shaped metamaterials, and for using 17 nm spherical gold nanoparticles for detection of matrix metalloprotease 7 (MMP-7), a biomarker that is heavily up-regulated during certain cancers. With the inflection point, the limit of detection (LOD) for MMP-7 is improved to 0.094 μg/mL from 0.22 μg/mL. This improvement may facilitate early diagnosis of salivary and colorectal cancers.

In this article, a mathematic model of electrode erosion was developed, in which state changes, energy balance equation of the interface between arc plasma and electrode, and moving boundary were taken into account. The parameters of arc stagnation time on static contact and arc current were measured, which can be taken as input conditions for the erosion model. Then the temperature distribution, erosion rate, erosion volume and erosion mass were calculated under 3kA short circuit current. The validity of the model was verified by comparing the simulated erosion masses with experimental results. The influences of arc stagnation time and mass fraction of SnO2 on the erosion mass of electrode were also analyzed under 3kA short circuit current. It is found that with the increase of arc stagnation time from 0.5ms to 1ms, the quality of mass loss increases linearly and the growth rate is approximately 7.06mg/ms.

However, it is difficult for conventional CMP to achieve high material removal rate (MRR) and high surface quality while polishing of hard and brittle materials such as monocrystalline silicon. Therefore, ultrasonic elliptical vibration (UEV) is employed to aid conventional CMP in our research, which combines the functions of conventional CMP and ultrasonic machining. In the ultrasonic elliptical vibration-aided chemical mechanical polishing (UEV-CMP) experimental setup developed by us, the workpiece attached on the ultrasonic vibrator can vibrate simultaneously in both horizontal and vertical directions during CMP. It is found that the ultrasonic elliptical vibration can effectively increase the MRR while maintaining surface quality in conventional CMP. The possible mechanism in UEV-CMP is firstly analyzed chemically to establish a reasonable material removal rate model. The effects of the ultrasonic elliptical vibration on the interaction among the abrasive particles, polishing pad, and workpiece are investigated to explain why the MRR of UEV-CMP is higher than that of the conventional CMP. A mathematic model, which includes polishing variables such as morphology and material properties of polishing pad; abrasive size; and material properties of particles, frequency, and amplitude of the ultrasonic vibration as well as polishing process parameters, is set up to interpret the increase in MRR for UEV-CMP. The results from the MRR model show that the ultrasonic elliptical vibration can improve material removal by increasing both the chemical reaction efficiency of polishing solution and mechanical impact efficiency of the abrasive particles on the workpiece surface and also by increasing vibration amplitude in vertical direction as the horizontal vibration contributes less towards the increment of MRR. Experiments are conducted for model verification, which should be that the experimental results agree well with model predictions. © 2017 Springer-Verlag London","Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP); Hard and brittle materials; Material removal rate (MRR); Ultrasonic elliptical vibration (UEV)","Abrasives; Brittleness; Chemical polishing; Efficiency; Monocrystalline silicon; Polishing; Surface properties; Ultrasonic cutting; Ultrasonic effects; Vibrations (mechanical); Chemical mechanical polishing(CMP); Hard and brittle materials; Horizontal vibration; Material removal model; Material removal rate; Ultrasonic elliptical vibration; Ultrasonic machining; Ultrasonic vibration; Chemical mechanical polishing"

Based on the mathematic model built in Matlab, the effects of following factors on the CO2 capture ratio were analyzed, such as the carbonation temperature, sorbent inventory, sorbent circulation flow rate and the sorbent make-up rate, etc. Results show that, to obtain 90% capture ratio of CO2 (rcc), the carbonation temperature in NGCC power plant would be 594℃, which is lower than that in coal-fired power plant (650℃), due to the low mole fraction of CO2 in NGCC power plant.

For a fixed F0, rcc increases significantly and then levels off with the increase of WCaO and FR, whereas for the same WCaO, rcc increases with the rise of F0 and FR, however, when FR gets up to a certain value, rcc reduces instead, due to the insufficient inventory of CaO in carbonator, leading to that partial of the CaO entering into the carbonator can't achieve the maximum conversion. © 2017, Editorial Department of Chinese Society of Power Engineering.

When the IOL, is in an aquatic environment, glistenings, which are liquid-filled microvacuoles, can be discriminated from normal state. Automatic detection of glistenings is a new problem, they have tiny sizes, sometimes have low contrast and also similar with the lens background. In this paper, the candidate glistenings are automatically detected by mathematic morphology method and fine segmented using the classifiers, we used k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and Naïve Bayes for comparing the results. The detected glistenings are validated by object-based with ophthalmologists hand-drawn ground-truth. The result shows that classification can improve the performance of glistenings detection better than using only morphology method. The proposed software was developed for creating an effective automatic glistenings detection and quantification with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface,reliable results.

Compression tests were performed using double hit schedules at temperatures of 1273-1423 K, strain rates of 0.01-5 s-1, initial grain sizes of 92-149 μm and an inter-pass time of 0.5-10 s. The experimental results show that MDRX softening fraction increases with the increasing of deformation temperature, strain rate, and inter-pass time, while it decreases with the increasing of initial grain size. Based on the experimental results, the MDRX softening fraction kinetic model and recrystallized grain size model of the tested steel was established. Besides, using the above mathematic models, a finite element model was built to simulate the MDRX process of the tested steel. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental ones, which indicates that finite element method is an effective approach to analyze the MDRX behavior and the established that mathematic models of the tested steel are reliable and accurate.

For instance, addition, minus, division and multiplication operations need to be mastered by students due to mathematic complexity as the learning mathematic grows higher. Weak foundation in mathematic also contribute to high failure rate in mathematic subjects in schools. In fact, students in primary schools are struggling to learn mathematic because they need to memorize formulas, multiplication or division operations. To date, this study will develop a puppet prototyping for learning mathematic for six to ten digits multiplication. Ten participants involved in the process of developing the prototype in this study. Students involved in the study were those from the intermediate class students whilst teachers were selected based on their vast knowledge and experiences and have more than five years of experience in teaching mathematic. Close participatory analysis will be used in the prototyping process as to fulfil the requirements of the students and teachers whom will use the puppet in learning six to ten digit multiplication in mathematic. Findings showed that, the students had a great time and fun learning experience in learning multiplication and they able to understand the concept of multiplication using puppet. Colour and materials of the puppet also help to attract student attention during learning.

But such thermodynamic model must be extended to reflect reality as accurately as possible. Micro turbo compressor engines are a specific type of heat engines that are derived from normal turbo compressor engines. To compute their thermodynamic parameters we need to know their dimensions and choose many coefficients, which describe them. With this model we can get the needed state variables, which describe the engine's operational mode, load, and degradation. In order to use the thermodynamic model as a diagnostic tool it has to be transformed into some kind of mathematic tool, like Matlab/Simulink to get comparative data at real time.

In order to reduce the heat loss, a heat recovery system with nine heat recovery exchangers is proposed in this paper. Experimental measurements are carried out to investigate the heat transfer characteristics of each heat recovery exchanger. Then, integration of thermal resistance and fluid flow performance analyses yields the mathematic relations connecting the heat transfer areas and the mass flow rates of heat recovery exchangers to the system requirements. Based on the relations, two optimization problems are formed to deduce the optimization equation groups by the conditional extremum principles. Solving the equation groups gives the optimal arrangement of the structural and operating parameters of the heat recovery exchangers. Finally, the optimization cases of a series-parallel system with practical heat recovery exchangers are studied. The results illustrate that the optimization method based on thermal resistance analyses can obtain the optimal area allocation and mass flow rate distribution of each heat recovery exchanger compared with the traditional method such as the control variate method.

Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been an effective approach to investigate genetic components underlying mathematic ability. Although previous studies reported several candidate genetic variants, none of them exceeded genome-wide significant threshold in general populations. Herein, we performed GWAS in Chinese elementary school students to identify potential genetic variants associated with mathematics ability. The discovery stage included 494 and 504 individuals from two independent cohorts respectively. The replication stage included another cohort of 599 individuals. In total, 28 of 81 candidate SNPs that met validation criteria were further replicated. Combined meta-analysis of three cohorts identified four SNPs (rs1012694, rs11743006, rs17778739 and rs17777541) of SPOCK1 gene showing association with mathematics ability (minimum p value 5.67 × 10-10, maximum β -2.43). The SPOCK1 gene is located on chromosome 5q31.2 and encodes a highly conserved glycoprotein testican-1 which was associated with tumor progression and prognosis as well as neurogenesis. This is the first study to report genome-wide significant association of individual SNPs with mathematics ability in general populations. Our preliminary results further supported the role of SPOCK1 during neurodevelopment. The genetic complexities underlying mathematics ability might contribute to explain the basis of human cognition and intelligence at genetic level. © The Author(s) 2017.",,

A multilevel partition scheduling method is creatively proposed which is divided into three levels: upper-level scheduling region, scheduling cell and PBS station. Based on the detailed analysis of the hierarchical partitioning process and related parameters, a multi-objective optimization scheduling model with time window combined with virtual cell is presented to solve the problem of inter-cell scheduling. And also the optimal path model of scheduling within cell is built. The pattern of inter- cell flexible scheduling and inner- cell semi- deterministic scheduling is formed.

A series of numerical calculations were conducted on the mathematical model, and then a double logarithmic curve of the bottom hole pressure (BHP) and a semi-logarithmic curve of pressure derivative were plotted. According to the semi-logarithmic curve, pressure derivative curves of vugs initially increase and then decrease; meanwhile, the derivative curves of the nearest vug from the well increases and decreases most rapidly, and its turning point presents earlier than other vugs. The double logarithmic curve could be divided into four stages-wellbore storage effect reaction stage, fracture reaction stage, vug reaction stage, and boundary reaction stage. Finally, we studied the characteristics of the double logarithmic curve from a series of models with different number/volume/arrangement of vugs and different apertures/arrangements of fractures, and it was found that the characteristics of double logarithmic curves change with the different above-mentioned parameters. © 2017, Science Press.

Potential energy of two contacts directly determines on the friction force. However, many mathematic models proposed, always abandon the instantaneous status during sliding to devote to a weighted average over lateral force, which might miss some information about friction behavior. In this work, the relation among potential energies, separation distances of two contracts, and positions in the sliding direction are studied to evaluate the instantaneous friction characteristics. Two hydrogenated diamond surfaces are used as the examined model. The results show that a watershed between positive and negative friction forces locates at the position with the minimum adsorption energy. A rapid decrease in potential energy occurs near the 2.5 nN external force, where the friction coefficient approaches zero at each position in the sliding direction. Therefore, a novel method may be developed to greatly reduce the friction coefficient between two surfaces by adjusting the contract pressure. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"Hydrogenation; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Tribology; Adsorption energies; First principle calculations; Friction characteristics; Friction coefficients; Hydrogenated diamond; Interaction potentials; Separation distances; Weighted averages; Friction"

Taking the Xin'anquan water supply expansion project as an example, this paper analyzes and calculates the hydraulic transition in two operating conditions, aiming to design a reasonable pump outlet valve for valve regulation and protection. The results show that the two-stage shut-off butterfly valve at the pump outlet can effectively protect the water hammer of the high-lift and long distance pipelines. Through the reasonable control of the fast and slow cutoff time and angle, the proposed valve succeeds in reducing the water pressure, the unit reversal and the drain flow. The water hammer protection measure is suitable for this project and ensures the safe and stable operation of Xin'anquan water supply pumping station.

A mathematic model was developed to find out the dynamic mechanisms of the transient process. By discussing the interface velocity and the stresses on the interface, the effects of two mainly governed dimensionless numbers, electric capillary number (Ca) and Ohnesorge number (Oh), on the oscillation modes were explained in detail. A greater Ca or Oh leads to a transformation of oscillation modes from underdamping to overdamping. For the amplitude of the first overshoot (Am) which monotonically decreases with Oh, however, there exists a critical Ca at which Am reaches its peak value. Afterwards, with the help of high speed photography, the rising time of overdamping mode was investigated. Despite of very small discrepancy, good agreement between model predictions and experimental results of the scaling law of the dimensionless rising time was observed. The results indicate that the dimensionless rising time shows a linear relationship with Ca under semi-log coordination. This valuable scaling law could provide reference for the optimizing design of oil–water separation devices. © 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Drop deformation; Electric field; Electrohydrodynamics; Interface; Transient response",

The calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental results. This model can be well applied to estimate the static deformation law of copper cylinders, and has wide applicability to different specifications of copper cylinders. According to the mathematical model, the variation of copper cylinder pressure sensitivity with deformation and the influence of machining dimension deviation on the accuracy of pressure measuring are calculated. When the height of copper cylinder after compression is 73% of its original one, the pressure sensitivity of the copper cylinder is the highest.

Ltd, Shanghai, China; Zhang, W., Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Robotics, Shanghai University of Engineering Science, Shanghai, China","In the conventional output voltage feedback loop design of an active power factor corrector (PFC), the bandwidth of the loop is limited to a frequency significantly lower than the input line voltage frequency. This is due to the fact that the compensator placed in the output-voltage feedback loop is usually designed to have a narrow bandwidth in order to filter the voltage ripple of twice the line frequency coming from the PFC output dc voltage. This feedback loop is designed with this filtering effect because a relatively high ripple voltage would cause considerable distortion in the reference of the line current feedback loop. However, a low bandwidth voltage feedback loop would bring poor dynamic response which usually causes large overshoots and dips during load transient change. Therefore, a compromise is generally made for the traditional design of the output voltage feedback loop, which leads to an issue that both the steady and the dynamic behaviours of the PFC are not optimal. In this paper, mathematic model of the steady behaviour of a PFC with voltage ripple in the output-voltage feedback loop is studied using two parameters: the amplitude of the relative voltage ripple on the control output signal and its phase lag angle of the voltage feedback loop. On the basis of the analysis, a second-order voltage harmonic injection to the output-voltage feedback loop is used to eliminate the voltage harmonic components from the voltage feedback loop. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed second-order harmonic injection method was verified by simulation and experimental results. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","harmonic compensation; PFC; voltage ripple",

Heavy metals have a strong interaction with a variety of enzymes and proteins in the human body, where the protein and enzymes lose activity. Heavy metals maybe enrich in certain organs of the body, and if its content exceeds the limits of the content that human body can tolerate, it will cause human acute poisoning, subacute poisoning, and chronic poisoning. Development of portable rapid detection equipment of heavy metal becomes necessary. In this study, heavy metal lead ions (Pb2+) are the research object, and the research is based on colorimetry theory, Lambert-Beer's law and spectrometry to develop a portable detector for Pb2+. According to the analysis of the physical and chemical properties of Pb2+ and the research of colorimetric reaction between Pb2+ and dithizone, existing colorimetric detection method of Pb2+ is improved, and complex and cumbersome pre-process of detector is simplified. Under suitable conditions of room temperature, pH value of 9.0 and certain volume, Pb2+ reacts with dithizone solution whose color is blue-green, which can generate orange complex, so that the measured value of Pb2+ can be converted to easily measured mathematic data to build detection model for the determinator, and other metal ions do not interfere in the determination by adding the masking agents. The determinator designed includes the optical circuit part and electric circuit part. The optical circuit part consists of light source, optical fiber, and silicon detector, which is used to collect the optical signal. Optical module uses the 510 nm wavelength LED (light- emitting diode) with narrow band filter as the active light source, and optical fiber is the transmission channel to make sure the monochromatic light source gives the parallel and vertical light striking the detector. Additionally, a silicon photodetector is the optical detector. The optical part is aimed to detect the band transmittance. Electric circuit is designed to convert the light signal to electrical digital signal, amplify the signal, decrease the noises, data process and store, and real-time display and communication. The electric circuit includes microcontroller, LED drive circuit, detection circuit, communication circuit, keyboard circuit, and liquid crystal display circuit, and lithium-ion battery is used as power supply. PS0308 type photodiode with spectral response range 300-1 100 nm converts the optical signal to electric signal and also effectively guarantees the linearity of the instrument. The system software is used to detect electric quantity, measure and manage data, and so on. All the connection parts are fixed together through the metal pieces to prevent deviation by the movement of light path. When the device has been installed, system performance is analyzed to assure the accuracy. Power consumption and anti-interference of the software and hardware are tested, also repetitive testing is done to verify the accuracy of the measurement. Experimental results show that decision coefficient of the predicted and the real concentration values in training set is 0.934, and the value is 0.822 2 in prediction set, and the detection range of determinator is 0.01-0.2 mg/L, indicating it can detect the Pb2+ with lower concentration. Relative standard deviation of Pb2+ concentration is less than 1.0%. The test results indicate that this determinator is simple to operate with satisfactory precision, accuracy, and repeatability, realizing the miniaturization of instrument and on-site rapid detection. At the same time, the determinator has simple and stable structure with low consumption. Based on the instrument, in the future work, the portable rapid detection of Pb2+ can be adapted to a variety of heavy metals in aqueous media with a low cost, low detection limits, and simple pre-treatment. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Tree structure plays an important role in both harvest efficiency and machine performance for tree fruit. To obtain better harvest efficiency, it is important to optimize the machine parameters and provide proper excitation to the trees according to their growth morphology. This paper presented a finite element modeling method for the trained tree dynamic response study in relation to shaker type. Firstly, mathematic models of 3 types of shakers, including reciprocal shaker, orbital shaker and multidirectional shaker, were built, which were further used to analyze the basic working principles of these shakers. The basic principle of developed shaking models was analyzed according to their characteristics. In order to study the influence of different shakers on the dynamic response of trained tree, 3 training structures i.e. spindle, open center and vertical plane were selected. Their 3D (three-dimensional) physical models including trunk and secondary limbs were constructed in Pro/Engineer. Other elements, such as leaves and twigs, were removed from the model. Then, these models were imported into ANSYS software to analyze their modal shapes. The modal shape and resonance frequency were obtained in a frequency range of 1-50 Hz. Results showed that the resonance frequency and modal shape were influenced by the growth morphology of trees. Three types of trained tree model (spindle, open center and vertical plane) could obtain ideal response at the 10th, 14th, and 19th phase respectively. For the developed trained tree model, the natural frequency range was mainly contained from 7.0 to 20.0 Hz, corresponding to 420-1200 r/min of mechanical shaker. As having thick tree truck, the initial mode frequency of spindle-shape tree was greater than the other 2 types. To further study the dynamic response of the developed tree models, harmonic response simulation was conducted with 3 types of excitation patterns. For the spindle-shape tree, 3 excitations could all induce violent vibration at far-end of the limb (i.e. NODE4 and NODE5). Simulation results showed that multidirectional excitation could cause a relatively ideal response at 13.5 Hz (10th phase) for spindle-shape tree model. Multidirectional excitation could also induce the most violent response among the 3 methods and obtain the maximum displacement at featured location up to 1.844 m. Orbital excitation with 12.0 Hz (11st phase) could cause evident response with the maximum displacement of 2.485 m, and also provide relatively uniform response for open center tree model. However, a small part of area could only achieve a relatively low vibration response, as a portion of vibration energy was absorbed by the tree crotch. To obtain higher detachment efficiency, shaking from different directions would increase the machine performance for this type of trained tree. For vertical plane tree model, both reciprocal and orbital shaker could cause superior response considering mechanical harvest. Results obtained from field experiment validated the correctness of simulation results. The illustration method including modal analysis and harmonic response simulation, could be useful for new mechanical shaker design for trained fruit tree harvest. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Firstly, a mathematic model and discrete state equation of cascaded H-bridge SVG are built in dq coordinate system for follow-up analysis. Secondly, two new kinds of state observers are designed and blended into the traditional dead-beat controlling algorithm to carry out current and voltage observation independently. By the use of these new designed observers and combined with the conventional discrete state observer, the intermediate variables can be calculated previously, and the instructive current of next beat can be observed in advance. For the purpose of improving the voltage tracking accuracy, an upgraded repetitive prediction algorithm is adopted to predict the output voltage. Finally, the MATLAB simulating models and an experimental SVG prototype rated 10 kV are built and tested by using ordinary state observing algorithm and the controlling method presented by this paper,respectively. The comparative experiments shown that, compared with the traditional state observing algorithm, the improved dead-beat controlling method mentioned by this paper can obviously reduce the total harmonic distortion(THD) to 1.18% from 3.21%.

The location of reflected laser spot on PSD when tracking laser exactly points to center of the retro-reflector, named initial position of miss distance, was the benchmark of miss distance calculation. So it was important to precisely calibrate initial position of miss distance in order to achieve high accurate measurement. A calibration method for initial position of PSD based on the retro-reflector feature analysis was presented in this paper. First, the error factors that may impact miss distance calibration were analyzed, and the mathematic model was established. Then, according to the laser tracker' s structure design and the geometric errors of axes, the calibration method for the initial position was simulated. Results show that the calibration error was limited below 17.8 μm, which means when the retro-reflector was placed at a distance of 10 m from the tracker, the laser tracker' s pointing error was limited below 1.1″. These results can be helpful in further error compensation model.

Firstly, mathematic model mapping the relationship between the inputs and the outputs of USTPM was set up. Secondly, both the actuation wrench screw and actuated twist screw's forms of the kinematical chains were obtained according to the condition that the velocity Jacobian matrix was a diagonal one. Then the rules to determine the non-actuated screws of the limbs were established in terms of the reciprocal product principle. Both criterion and steps of the limb's type synthesis were proposed as well. Finally, the mechanisms with the expected motion characteristics were designed by selection three limbs synthesized above to connect the platform and the base. Totally 60 symmetrical USTPMs were designed. Among them, 47 mechanisms were non-overconstrained and 29 mechanisms were composed of the open single kinematic chains with idle joints. The Jacobian was a diagonal matrix of the synthesized parallel mechanisms. It was more interesting that some mechanisms' Jacobian was the identical matrix, in which there existed one-to-one linear mapping relationship between the input velocities of the actuated joints and the output velocities of the moving platform for these mechanisms, and condition number of their Jacobians was equal to 1. So these mechanisms showed fully-isotropic throughout their whole workspace. Meanwhile, they performed very well with regard to motion and force transmission.

The geometric models of the scroll were built step by step, including the scroll involute, scroll dimensions, chamber areas and volumes, the scroll profile modifications and so on. The valve model, internal leakage model, motion equation, heat transfer equation and energy balance equation were combined with the geometric models to complete the scroll expander modelling. A mathematic model of a direct current generator or an experimentally determined correlation of generated power against rotational speed of the used generator was integrated to the expander model as the power output unit. To enhance the adaptability of the current model, an overall dynamic friction coefficient of the scroll expander and the generator was innovatively proposed and introduced as one of the key parameters in the present study. The accurate value of this coefficient should be experimentally determined for a specific expander – generator system; with the knowledge of such a parameter, the mechanical friction loss can be accurately and easily calculated in the simulation study.

To produce the adsorbed gas, the cleat pressure should be reduced to critical desorption pressure by dewatering first. But how to dewater more efficiently is a difficult issue. Apparently low dewatering rate is uneconomical due to excessive development times required. But from the field experiences, high dewatering rate will bring more problems such as coal break, stress sensitivity and two-phase flow in earliest stage, which will reduce the productivity, or sometimes make the well abandoned. Literatures have studied much about the effect of coal break and stress sensitivity. However, there is no discussion about the relationship between two-phase flow and dewatering rate. High dewatering rate is companied with high pressure drawdown which will cause gas desorption near wellbore area and simultaneously cause two-phase flow. Two-phase flow has significant negative effect on pressure propagation, which controls investigation distance or drainage area in the early stage, and therefore affects the overall productivity. Since the purpose of dewatering is to maximize the drainage area and maximize the depressurization for whole reservoir, the dewatering rate should be controlled to ensure well-bottom hole flowing pressure (BHFP) is larger than critical desorption pressure in order to avoid the occurrence of two-phase flow in the dewatering stage. Based on this principle, a procedure for optimal dewatering rate is presented and a mathematic model is established. It is shown that initial pressure, critical desorption pressure, permeability, porosity, and fracture half-length play significant roles in dewatering rate determination. This method is easy, and has applied in CBM development region of Han-Cheng, China. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Coal-bed methane; Dewatering rate; Investigation distance; Pressure propagation","Abandoned wells; Boreholes; Bottom hole pressure; Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Desorption; Dewatering; Methane; Natural gas wells; Productivity; Water levels; Characteristics of pressures; Coal bed methane wells; Critical desorption pressure; Fracture half-length; Investigation distance; Pressure propagation; Rate optimizations; Stress sensitivity; Two phase flow"

The new scene-graph SSVEP paradigm uses life scenes of normal or disabled persons as the stimulus source. According to the target of prosthesis control, the life scenes are decomposed into corresponding stimulation scene graphs through standardization process of gray scales. After that, a set of contrasting black-and-white reversal scene graphs are obtained for visual stimulation. The new scene-graph SSVEP is evoked by a square pulse modulation with different frequencies and different scene images. Furthermore, the mathematic model of the scene-graph SSVEP nerve conduction is simulated. For recognizing various EEG signals from different scene graph stimulations, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is used to turn EEG features into control commands. Finally, a brain-controlled prosthesis manipulation platform was built and the new strategy was verified by experiments. Results show that the information transfer rate is approximately 15.34 bit/min, the average accuracy is 91.4% and the highest accuracy is up to 98.44%.

To accomplish the BSRM's suspension control, the radial force analytical model is necessary. Currently the mathematic relationship among radial force, winding currents, and rotor rotation angle has been built for double-winding BSRM, but the rotor eccentricity displacement has not been considered. That is, the existing radial force analytical model only can be used to analyze rotor radial force when rotor shaft is located in the central position. Actually, the rotor radial force is significantly affected by the rotor shaft eccentricity displacement. It is difficult for the bearingless motor to keep the rotor shaft staying in the central position, and the rotor shaft always runs around the central position with an eccentricity displacement. The rotor eccentricity caused by the radial force is considered in the paper to obtain the air-gap permeance and the windings inductances. Furthermore, the radial forces analytical model considering the rotor eccentricity displacement is derived. Finally, the finite-element method (FEM)-based results are applied and the dynamics simulation using the proposed model is accomplished to verify the correctness of the model. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","air-gap eccentricity; analytical model; bearingless switched reluctance motor; dynamics simulation; electrical machine; magnetic bearings; motor; PID; radial force; suspension control","Analytical models; Dynamics; Electric machine control; Electric motors; Finite element method; Magnetic bearings; Magnetic devices; Motors; Rotors (windings); Shaft displacement; Winding; Air-gap eccentricity; Bearingless switched reluctance motor; Dynamics simulation; Electrical machine; Radial forces; Suspension control; Reluctance motors"

In addition, the structural strength of petroleum coke sludge slurry (PCSS) was calculated by two mathematic models to illustrate the how the sludge improves the stability of PCSS. The results indicated that the absolute value of the Zeta potential of PCSS increased with the sludge addition and that PCSS stability improved. However, the absolute value of the Zeta potential decreased and the stability declined after the sludge was modified by Fe2(SO4)3 and Ca(OH)2. Petroleum coke particles were wrapped by sludge flocs, and small particles flocculated during their co-slurry process to form a spatial network structure, effectively prevented the settlement of petroleum coke particles and ultimately improved the stability of slurry. The calculation results obtained by the two mathematic models reveal that the shearing energy consumption per-unit-quality of PCSS using raw sludge is twice or thrice than that of PCWS.

In total 637 samples were used to construct and test the mathematic model. The correlation coefficient (R2) between the NIRS predicated results and the chemical extraction method was .98, .97, and .96 for the calibration, cross validation, and external validation, respectively. For external validation, the average relative error and the mean absolute error was 0.78 and 2.02%, respectively, compatible with those of chemical extraction method. Further determination suggested that 1.5 g was the minimal quantity of sample loading to obtain stable results and the NIRS method showed a similar repeatability to the chemical extraction method. Taken together, NIRS method enables the rapid detection of oil quantity of intact B. napus seeds. Practical applications: The present study constructed a mathematic model for the measurement of oil content of rapeseed using the NIRS technology. Compared with the traditional method for oil content determination using the chemical extraction, the NIRS method is cheaper, safer, more rapid, and convenient. It shows similar repeatability to the chemical extraction method and needs not to destroy the samples. Thus, the method raised in the present study could be used to detect the oil content of intact rapeseeds in food and breeding industries. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Infrared devices; Oils and fats; Average relative error; Chemical extraction method; Chemical extractions; Correlation coefficient; Cross validation; Mathematic model; Mean absolute error; Rapid detection; Extraction"

To obtain the precession period of projectile effectively, a precession period extraction method based on phase differential is introduced. Precession of projectile brings micro-Doppler modulation on echoes of continuous-wave radar, and its mathematic model indicates that the micro-velocity produced by precession changes with the law of sine, and the change rate of its phase is inversely proportional to precession period. The phase of the micro-velocity can be obtained by Hilbert transform, and then the precession period can be derived by the phase differential of the micro-velocity. The experimental results show that, for the micro-velocity signal which S/N is greater than 7 dB, precession period can be effectively extracted with the proposed method, and this method is more precise and smooth for actual measuring data. © 2017, Editorial Board of Acta Armamentarii.

However, due to the uncertainty of weather, traffic conditions, and other random factors, it is not appropriate to set travel speeds to fixed constants in advance. Consequently, we propose a mathematic model for calculating expected fuel consumption and fixed vehicle cost where average speed is assumed to obey normal distribution on each arc which is more realistic than the existing model. For small-scaled problems, we make a linear transformation and solve them by existing solver CPLEX, while, for large-scaled problems, an improved simulated annealing (ISA) algorithm is constructed.

Transport represents a quarter of the total amount of greenhouse gases and 36% of energy consumption in Spain. As a consequence, a new law regarding emissions has been approved. Such law regulates the acceptable emission levels of combustion gases for new vehicles sold in any of the European Union Member States. This work deals with parallel-hybrid electric vehicles in order to face the increasing environmental pollution and reduce energy consumption. The present paper shows a modelling of electric and parallel-hybrid electric vehicle using Matlab/Simulink environment which allows us to access different aspects of the vehicle such as engine power, type and size of the battery or weight and to observe how changes can affect the performance and the distance travelled. The model was simulated in order to obtain the electric vehicle's autonomy. Through the use of a Geographic Information System together with a mathematic algorithm based on genetic algorithms the planning of charging stations was obtained, where the installation investment cost was minimized and the geographic distribution was improved in order to increase the quality of the service by improving reliability. After a simulation which took place in a city of Spain, Zaragoza, losses were reduced from 156.60 to 115.27. © 2017","Charging Stations (CS); Electric Vehicle (EV); Genetic algorithm; Modelling; Parallel-hybrid electric vehicle (Parallel-HEV)","Charging (batteries); Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Geographic information systems; Geographical distribution; Greenhouse gases; Information systems; Investments; MATLAB; Models; Vehicles; Charging station; Environmental pollutions; Mathematic algorithms; MATLAB/Simulink environment; Parallel hev; Parallel hybrid electric vehicles; Reduce energy consumption; Transport sectors; Hybrid vehicles"

To improve the energy efficiency of the steelmaking it is necessary to investigate how to improve the hot blast stove operation. In this work a mathematic model for evaluating the performance of the hot blast stove was developed using a finite difference approximation for the heat transfer inside the stove during operation. The developed model was calibrated and validated by using the process data from hot blast stove V26 at SSABs plant in Oxelösund, Sweden. The investigation shows a good agreement between the measured and modelled data. As a case study, the developed model was used to simulate the effect of a new concept of OxyFuel technique to hot blast stoves. The investigation shows that, by using this OxyFuel technique, it is possible to maintain the blast temperature while removing the usage of coke oven gas (COG). The saved COG can be used to replace some fossil fuel, such as oil and LPG. Furthermore, the effect of the cycle time on the single stove was studied. As expected, both the hot blast and flue gas temperatures are increased when increasing the cycle time. This shows that it is a good strategy for the hot blast stove to increase the blast temperature if the stove is currently not operated with the maximum allowed flue-gas temperature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Blast furnace stove; Flame temperature; Flue gas; Heat transfer; Hot blast","Blast furnaces; Coke ovens; Energy efficiency; Finite difference method; Flue gases; Flues; Fossil fuels; Heat transfer; Blast temperature; Developed model; Finite difference approximations; Flame temperatures; Flue gas temperatures; Hot blast stoves; Large amounts; Mathematic model; Stoves; cooking appliance; energy efficiency; fossil fuel; heat transfer; iron; liquefied petroleum gas; numerical model; steel; temperature effect; Sweden"

For the Kemerovo region, effective technologies of waste recycling were provided for additional products meeting all consumers’ requirements. These technologies were integrated into scenarios that provide a full cycle of rational nature management. The task of waste processing scenarios generation has been formulated. Scenarios for gradual processing of iron ore waste with extraction of useful components by chemical methods, reclamation of disturbed lands and creation of recreation zones in the exempt lands were developed. Recommendations and technological solutions for all-the-year processing, including winter, of iron ore waste by chemical methods are offered. The maps of tailings dumps processing with stage-by-stage processing and reclamation of disturbed lands are presented. The number of stages is determined by investments and annual capacity of waste recycling complex with possible simultaneous operation of several sections. After the complete excavation of iron ore wastes from the tailing dumps, preparatory work was carried out for construction of recreation areas, including searching for a tender, choosing the design of recreation areas, equipment, buildings and structures dismantling and selling, soil reclamation, lawns, trees and shrubs planting. Reclamation of the territory was carried out during the operation of processing plant; commissioning of recreation areas was made after the end of operation. Mathematical modeling of scenarios for concentration plants iron ore wastes processing in the Kemerovo region was carried out based on the following performance indicators: economic effect; reclamation of disturbed lands; pollution; mining area population with normative socio-cultural indicators; prevented pollution per capita. The toolkit of model experiments is a software package for Scilab environment. From the proposed scenarios, Pareto-optimal solutions were selected graphically. Selection of priorities among Pareto-optimal scenarios was carried out by ranking, based on levels of social and environmental safety (low, moderate and high) in the Kemerovo region. © 2017, National University of Science and Technology MISIS.

Thus, reducing the cutting resistance and power consumption of maize stalks under this status is very significant for development of high-efficiency high-stubble cutting devices. Based on a self-designed testing system that highly restored the maize high-stubble cutting conditions and by means of experimental design and mathematic statistics, the effects of working parameters (blade angle, blade shape, cutting speed and cutting angle) on the maximum cutting resistance and power consumption were studied. By analyzing stress conditions during the stalk cutting process, six mathematic models were built to express the relationships between individual factors and the maximum cutting resistance or cutting power consumption. Through model optimization, the parameter combination for optimal cutting performance of maize stalks under unilaterally-fixed no-support cutting status was obtained: blade angle is 18°, blade shape is isosceles triangle, cutting speed is 9.5 m/s, and cutting angle is 75°. Field validation experiments under this parameter combination showed that the maximum cutting resistance was (55.23±3.50) N (declined by 11.04%), and power consumption was (11.41±1.04) J (declined by 16.65%).

The proposed QRA model consists of a collision frequency estimation model, an event tree and consequence estimation models. The event tree comprises five intermediate events including ship type, ship size, loading condition, hull damage and survivability. Two “generic” mathematic models are developed to estimate the human life loss and oil pollution caused by ship collisions, respectively.

Desired harmonic parameters are obtained from the analysis, in order to suppress the torque ripple as much as possible. Further, a method for reducing the 5th and 7th harmonic components of torque ripple is proposed, according to the characteristics of back-EMF harmonic distribution. The proposed method is greatly simplified and more feasible by only injecting 5th and 7th harmonic currents.

In order to displace PI controller, the LADRC strategy which consisted of linear state error feedback (LSEF) control algorithm and linear extended state observer (LESO), is designed based on the mathematic model of PMSM. The purpose of LSEF is to make sure fast response to load mutation and system uncertainties, and LESO is designed to estimate the uncertain disturbances.

Participants performed a symbolic magnitude comparison task (i.e. determining which of two numbers is numerically larger), with simultaneous electrophysiological recording. Partial directed coherence and graph theory methods were used to estimate and depict frontoparietal connectivity in both groups. The behavioral measures showed that children with LA performed significantly slower and less accurately than their peers in the HA group. Significantly higher frontocentral connectivity was found in LA compared with HA; however, when the connectivity analysis was restricted to parietal locations, no relevant group differences were observed.

A thermal mathematic model with groundwater seepage was proposed, and a numerical model was established to describe the impacts of groundwater seepage on the temperature distribution in the KCP. The results show that the groundwater seepage velocity improved with the increasing permeability of porous medium in the KCP. The increasing seepage velocity improves thermal convection and then improves thermal conduction in the porous medium. As a result, the heat in the deep Ordovician limestone groundwater gradually diffuses. The seepage velocity occurred differently in different locations of KCP, and the heat exchange was also different, resulting in temperature differences for different locations. This temperature divergence in the surrounding rocks can reach 5~9°C at distances less than 50 m to the KCP. These findings can be used to protect the mine from water inrush by monitoring temperature changes in the surrounding rocks of KCP. © 2016, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Karst collapse pillar; Ordovician limestone; Permeability; Seepage velocity; Temperature distribution; Thermal conduction; Thermal convection",

Evacuation routes are, mostly, based on the capacities of the roads network. However, in extreme cases, such as earthquakes, roads network infrastructure may adversely affected, and may not supply their required capacities. If for various situations, the potential damage for critical roads can be identify in advance, it is possible to develop an evacuation model, that can be used in various situations to plan the network structure in order to provide fast and safe evacuation. This paper focuses on the development of a model for the design of an optimal evacuation network which simultaneously minimizes construction costs and evacuation time.

The simplified point reactor model could be further converted to the transfer function with the Laplace transfer tool. Until now, the point reactor transfer function is still used as the basic means for researching the nuclear reactor control system and the relative engineering items. However, through the analysis, it is found that the linearizd point reactor model based on the hypothesis that reactivity is zero when reactor is at the stable state has its own problems. This paper gives the concise analysis of the problems. The analysis method is the combination of theory and experiment. Theoretically, the focus is to compare the time domain results and the frequency domain results by means of the system dynamics principles.

CS is a mathematic theory providing an approximate recovery for a sparse signal with minimal reconstruction error from under-sampled measurements. Considering the natural sparsity of the damage, CS algorithm is employed to image the defect in the concrete-filled steel tube of Shenyang Metro line 9 for reducing the work time. Thus, in the measurement stage, far fewer ultrasonic measurement paths were selected from the dense net of conventional ultrasonic CT techniques to capture the underlying damage information. Then, in the imaging stage, L1-norm minimization algorithm of CS theory is selected to recover the internal damage via fusing measurement data and solving optimization problem. The functionality of the proposed method is validated by three numerical concrete tube models with various conditions. Additionally, both the conventional ultrasonic CT technique and the proposed one are employed for ultrasonic inspection of the STS structure in Shenyang Metro line 9. Both the numerical and experimental results indicate that the proposed ultrasonic CT improved by CS has a great potential for damage detection, which provides an alternative accurate and effective way for non-destructive testing/evaluation (NDT/E). © 2017 by the authors.","Compressive sampling; Nondestructive testing/evaluation; Steel tube slab; Ultrasonic computerized tomography",

The study is based on secondary data collected by the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ III). SACMEQ employed cluster-sampling procedures to collect data from 4412 students in 193 schools in Kenya, and 3021 students in 155 schools in Zimbabwe. A multilevel model (Hierarchical linear model) was used to analyse variation in student achievement in mathematics between and within schools. Owing to the nested nature of the data, the study utilised the Wiley and Harnischfeger model as a general framework for choosing variables and conceptualising multiple components of education. The findings in both countries showed that socio-economic status and school resources were significant predictors of mathematics achievement. The variable class size n Kenya was positively related to mathematics achievement, but in Zimbabwe a negative and significant relationship existed between class size and achievement. In Kenya school type was positively associated with mathematic achievement, but in Zimbabwe no such association existed. Additionally, 25–30% of the variance in student achievement in mathematics in both countries is explained by differences between schools. These findings suggest a disparity in mathematics achievement between schools in both countries based on class size and school type. Stakeholders can use these findings to make policies that help establish parity across the schools. © 2017 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (SAARMSTE).","Hierarchical linear models; Large-scale dataset; Mathematics achievement; SACMEQ",

However, SHM implementations especially damage detections for real-world infrastructures are always overwhelmed with uncertainties of high dimensionality. A nonprobabilistic uncertainty-quantification-enhanced damage diagnosis method is proposed in this study with respect to interval analysis on SHM features. The diagonal elements of the vector auto-regressive model, constructed from the data measurements, are firstly extracted to form a vector, and this vector's Mahalanobis distance between pristine and unknown conditions is used as a damage-sensitive feature. Subsequently, the uncertainty sources, such as measurement inaccuracy and physical variability, are considered as influencing variables. A differential evolution algorithm is thereby introduced to convert the fluctuating interval of those variables into the uncertainty interval of Mahalanobis distance estimation. Finally, inspired by the idea of receiver operating characteristics when probability of detection is available, a modified mathematic metric is defined suited for interval analysis, and area under the modified receiver operating characteristics curve is employed to detect and localize damages. A contrived numerical mass-spring system and a laboratory-scale frame structure are used to validate the proposed framework; and in addition, the damage severity is able to be quantified via a proposed interval distance between pristine and inspection conditions. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Damage detection; Differential evolution algorithm; Interval analysis; Receiver operating characteristics; Structural health monitoring; Uncertainty quantification","Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization; Structural analysis; Structural health monitoring; Uncertainty analysis; Civil engineering applications; Differential evolution algorithms; Interval analysis; Non-probabilistic uncertainty; Receiver operating characteristics; Structural damage diagnosis; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Uncertainty quantifications; Damage detection"

This paper proposes a method to increase the channel capacity in such systems by means of an antenna array. A central challenge in the design of magnetic antenna arrays is to achieve low intra-array coupling along with high gain. These two properties are essential for increasing the channel capacity in comparison to single antenna communication systems of comparable volume.The method proposed in this paper utilizes circular loop antennas to reduce the intra-array coupling using magnetic flux cancellation.The mathematic approach employed in this paper considers each coil as a system of coupled inductors, where each inductor is a single turn loop, and the total coil self and mutual inductances are computed by summing the appropriate single turn loop inductances. Volume efficient coil topologies are identified, and an optimization method is proposed to minimize the intra-array coupling, subject to a required inductance. The proposed method allows to design volume efficient, up to 3 × 3, array, or pyramidal shaped 4 × 4 arrays.

To reduce the heat loss, a parallel and a series-parallel heat recovery systems with nine heat recovery exchangers are proposed to preheat the cold water in this paper. Experimental measurements are carried out to determine the heat transfer coefficient equations of each heat recovery exchanger. Then, the heat recovery systems are analyzed to deduce the mathematic relation between the design parameters and the system requirements, i.e. the temperatures and heat transfer rates of the nine heat recovery exchangers. The total heat transfer area, the total power consumption and the entropy generation due to heat transfer and fluid flow are set as the objective functions in four multi-objective optimization (MOO) cases. With the aid of the genetic algorithm in the Matlab 2015, the optimized operational and structural parameters are obtained. Finally, the MOO results are compared with that of the single objective optimization (SOO) method and the original values. The optimization results show that the MOO method are more suitable for the operational parameters design of the heat recovery systems compared with the SOO method. The required total heat transfer area and the total power consumption are decreased by at least 12.1% and 13.7%, respectively.

The study was designed to evaluate the disease outcome based on multiple biomarkers related to cerebral ischemia. Methods. Rats were randomly divided into sham, permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, and edaravone-treated groups. Cerebral ischemia was induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery in rats. To form a simplified crosstalk network, the related multiple biomarkers were chosen as S100β, HIF-1α, IL-1β, PGI2, TXA2, and GSH-Px. The levels or activities of these biomarkers in plasma were detected before and after ischemia. Concurrently, neurological deficit scores and cerebral infarct volumes were assessed. Based on a mathematic model, network balance maps and three integral disruption parameters (k and u) of the simplified crosstalk network were achieved. Results. The levels or activities of the related biomarkers and neurological deficit scores were significantly impacted by cerebral ischemia. The balance maps intuitively displayed the network disruption, and the integral disruption parameters quantitatively depicted the disruption state of the simplified network after cerebral ischemia. The integral disruption parameter u values correlated significantly with neurological deficit scores and infarct volumes. Conclusion. Our results indicate that the approach based on crosstalk network may provide a new promising way to integrally evaluate the outcome of cerebral ischemia. © 2017 Guimei Ran et al.",,

In terms of algorithm design, the sequential enumeration method (SEM) was employed to solve the model, for higher iteration efficiency and lower difficulty level of the algorithm. The first step was to find the optimal ES collection time, collection route and allocation program in the direct shipment mode, the hub-and-spoke mode and the mixed mode. Then, the three modes were compared in terms of the collection route planning, the shortest collection time, the shortest collection route and the optimal collection cost of the entire ES collection network. The numerical example showed that compared with the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, the result of SEM is basically the same with that of SA algorithm; however, SEM is simpler, more practical and easier to operate, so that it is of better promotional value. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Collection optimization; Disaster; Emergency logistics; Fuzzy demand; Sequential enumeration method (SEM)",

This article tried to conveniently and precisely model the agglomerate size evolution in modular co-rotating twin-screw extruder. The break-up process of agglomerate was analyzed to obtain the relationship between average deagglomerating energy (M) and agglomerate size, the result presented a mathematic relationship between M and agglomerate size. Numerical simulation study was conducted to consider the effect of kneading blocks (KB) or flight elements (FE) number on dispersion capacity of screw combination. The average deagglomerating energy, calculated based on POLYFLOW simulation, was introduced as major parameter to evaluate the dispersion capacity, which presented a proportional relationship to the KB or FE number. The model was developed by combining the agglomerate break-up process and simulation results. In validation, CaCO3/linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) compounds were prepared by modular co-rotating twin-screw extruder with different screw combinations. The optical image analysis showed that CaCO3 agglomerate size decreased with the KB or FE number rising, while it achieved minimum when the KB number was 4. The model was in accordance with the experimental results, and proved to be valid for KB and FE combinations in preparing CaCO3/LLDPE compounds. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Extrusion; Manufacturing; Theory and modeling","Dispersions; Extrusion; Fillers; Geometrical optics; Manufacture; Polyethylenes; Co-rotating twin screw extruders; Modeling and validation; Numerical simulation studies; Optical image analysis; Polymeric compounds; Proportional relationships; Theory and modeling; Twin screw extruders; Flight simulators"

The tribological characteristics of Cu-Ni-graphite composites with different graphite content were affected by physical properties and were generated variation correspondingly. It is difficult to study the correlation degree between tribological characteristics and physical properties by the means of experiments. However, grey correlation analysis (GCA) is a suitable mathematic method for researching the correlation with each factor. In this study, Cu-Ni-graphite composites were prepared by powder metallurgy and the correlation degree between tribological characteristics (Cu-Ni-graphite composites slid against U75V steel) and physical properties were calculated by GCA method. The results showed that through the calculating by GCA method, compared with physical properties of Cu-Ni-graphite composites, the most effective way to reduce the friction coefficient is to improve the relative density as well as the increasing of hardness can also bring down the friction coefficient usefully. The best way to reduce wear rate is the increasing of work of rupture and flexural strength, when these two properties have a small amount of ascension, the wear rate would be rapidly decreasing. The GCA results could help to improve materials’ performance and give reasonable advices to the following studies. © 2016","Cu-Ni-graphite composites; Gray correlation analysis; Switch slide baseplates",

Reverse Conducting IGBT (RC-IGBT) constructs the conventional IGBT function and freewheel diode function in a single chip, which has a greater flow ability in the same package volume. In the same cooling conditions, RC-IGBT allows for a higher operating temperature. In this paper, a mathematic model is developed, referring to the datasheets and measurement data, to study the 6.5 kV/1000 A RC-IGBT switching features. The relationship among the gate desaturated pulse, conducting losses, and recovery losses is discussed. Simulations and tests were carried out to consider the influence of total losses on the different amplitudes and durations of the desaturated pulse. The RC-IGBT traction converter system with gate pulse desaturated control is built, and the simulation and measurements show that the total losses of RC-IGBT with desaturated control decreased comparing to the RC-IGBT without desaturated control or conventional IGBT.

In the present study, 2 standards were used to classify and examine types of mathematics disorder: (a) application of procedural knowledge skills, and (b) conceptual understanding. The participants were children (N=31; 19 boys, 12 girls; 4th to 9th graders) who had scored FIQ90 or above on the WISC-III and WISC-R tests (except for 1 of the children), and who had been given remedial education. Analysis of their test results from the standpoint of mathematical thinking identified 4 groups of mathematics disorders. The participants who were classified into 2 of the groups scored poorly on recalling numerical facts and performing calculations, and thus would be diagnosed as having a mathematic disorder. The participants classified into the other 2 groups, on the other hand, either scored poorly on allocating or dividing artifacts, or could not generate any ideas that were crucial for internalizing cognitive operations. If assessed using standard diagnostic testing, these latter participants might not be classified as having a mathematics disorder. The results of this study therefore suggest that the scope of testing that screens for mathematics disorders should be broadened to include evaluation of the children's conceptual understanding from the perspective of mathematical thinking.","Conceptual understanding; Image; Mathematical thinking; Mathematics disorders; Procedural knowledge",

The paper envisages the tax system development regularity as a dynamic system within various forms of economies. The methods of dialectics were applied in this article such as induction and deduction, analysis and synthesis as well as logic approach to noesis. Theoretic and methodological basis consists of fundamental works in the catastrophic theory, mathematic simulation, and self-organizing system theory represented in the works of Russian and foreign scientists. Different variants of phase transition from one economic system to another are defined within the present research. The features of each system phase transition within the acknowledged chronology are considered. The key impelling factors for each period are found. The probable development vector of the tax system after the finance crisis in 2018-2020 is determined. The altered economic conditions will require the formation of completely new tax system where the main taxable items will include labor, financial capital and land. The phase transition will presumably last for several decades and will induce high levels of social, politic, and economic instability in the world. The formation transition takes place under the influence of external factors and only at the precise moment when the previous formation has created the necessary conditions for that transition to the next formation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,

Method: Bacons made with three brands and three concentrations of smoking liquid and traditional wood chips smoking were analyzed by E-nose and E-tongue and verified with fuzzy mathematics sensory evaluation. Result: After analyzing the E-nose Principle Component Analysis (PCA) chart, the accumulating contribution of Principle Components (PC) 1 and 2 is 99.760%, much larger than 85%, which means PC1 and PC2 have contained enough information to reflect the whole sample information. The distribution areas of sample 4 (3‰ Mi nghua MH-SO152) and sample 1 (woodchips smoked) are obviously separated, which suggests that the odor of the two samples are clearly different. However, the distribution areas of sample 5 (1‰ Minghua SY-SO968), sample 7 (3‰ Minghua SY-SO968), sample 9 (2‰ Jinniushan II), and sample 10 (3‰ Jinniushan II) are close to that of sample 1, which means their smell is close to sample 1 as well. The distribution areas of sample 6 (2‰ Minghua SY-SO968) and sample 1 overlap partially, which means the smell of sample 6 (2‰ Minghua SY-SO968) and sample 1 (wood chips smoked) are basically the same, thus the bacon added with 2‰ Guangzhou Mnghua SY-SO968 smoking liquid smells basically the same as the traditional one. By analyzing the E-tongue Principle Component Analysis (PCA) chart, the accumulating contribution of Principle Components 1 and 2 is 88.903%, larger than 85%, enough to reflect the general sample information. The distribution areas of sample 2 (1‰ Minghua MH-SO152), sample 3 (2‰ Minghua MH-SO152) and sample 4 (3‰ Minghua MH-SO152) are far away from sample 1, which shows that their taste can be effectively distinguished from woodchips smoked sample 1. And the distribution areas of sample 8 (1‰ Jinniushan II), sample 9 (2‰ Jinniushan II) and sample 10 (3‰ Jinniushan II) locate near sample 1, thus they taste relatively like sample 1. The distribution areas of samples 5 (1‰ Minghua SY-SO968), 6, and 7 (3‰ Minghua SY-SO968) are closest to sample 1, which means they taste closest to sample 1, thus the bacons added with Guangzhou Mnghua SY-SO968 smoking liquid taste closest to the traditional one. In Fuzzy Mathematic Sensory Evaluation and flavor description, the comprehensive scores of samples 1, 6, 7 and 10 (3‰ Jinniushan II) are close and higher than sample 8, and described as heavy smoking flavor and good taste. The Fuzzy Mathematic Sensory Evaluation score of sample 6 is closest to sample 1, and the difference is merely 0.05, which verifies the E-nose and E-tongue results. Conclusion: After analyzing the E-nose and E-tongue Principle Component Analysis charts, the bacon added with 2‰ Guangzhou Mnghua SY-SO968 smoking liquid smells basically the same as the traditional one, and tastes closest as well, which means it can be used to replace the traditional smoking technique. Fussy mathematics sensory evaluation scores verified the fact and proved E-nose and E-tongue can be used to optimize bacon smoking procedure efficiently, thus provides a reference method to optimize meat production technique from flavor perspective.","Bacon; Electronic nose; Electronic tongue; Fuzzy mathematics sensory evaluation",

However, the observation residuals still exhibit, to a great extent, as (somewhat systematic) signals. Nevertheless, those systematic variations are referred to as the unmodelled errors, which are difficult to be further modelled by setting up additional parameters. Different from the random errors, the unmodelled errors are colored and time correlated. In general, the larger the time correlations are, the more significant the unmodelled errors. Hence, understanding the time correlations of unmodelled errors is important to develop the theory for processing the unmodelled errors. In this study, we compare and analyze the time correlations caused by unmodelled errors of Global Positioning System (GPS) and BeiDou signals. The time correlations are estimated based on the residuals of double differenced observations on 11 baselines with different lengths. The results show that the time correlation patterns are different significantly between GPS and BeiDou observations. Besides, the code and phase data from the same satellite system are also not the same. Furthermore, the unmodelled errors are affected by not only the baseline length, but also some other factors. In addition, to make use of the time correlations with more efficiency, we propose to fit the time correlations by using exponent and quadratic models and the fitting coefficients are given. Finally, the sequential adjustment method considering the time correlations is implemented to compute the baseline solutions. The results show that the solutions considering the time correlations can objectively reflect the actual precisions of parameter estimates. © 2016 Institute of Seismology, China Earthquake Administration","BeiDou; GPS; Precise positioning; Time correlation; Unmodelled error",

Firstly the electric field and the flow field information in e-coating process were obtained and the electrochemical simulation environment was established based on Faraday electro deposition theory. Then the mathematic model of e-coating process was built. Basic e-coating experiment models and its simulation models were established and the basic deposition parameters which were critical to paint deposition quantities were also obtained by comparing experiment results and simulation results and iteratively refining the parameters. The typical three-layered sheet metal structure of the regional frame was taken as the research object based on the division of the critical regions of vehicle body e-coating in engineering. Then a fully coupled electrochemical e-coating simulation model of the simplified regional structure of frame was built and verified. Based on these works, the areas and shapes of e-coating holes were taken as variables to do the research by electrochemical analysis method. The results show that hole area has a great effect on film thickness while hole shape almost has no influence on film thickness. Numerical disciplines of film decay are found, and the safety factor for e-coating film thickness in a regional frame cavity is then deduced. The safety factor of spacing design of holes is further deduced by analyzing the overlay effects of two holes on the stiffening plate. By applying the quantitative results to structure improvement of a frame in vehicle, corrosion in cavities can be successfully eliminated. © 2017, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

Results: Overall, 13 patients were screened and 12 were treated (50% male, median age: 68yrs), including 9 NSCLC patients. All patients received at least one week (3 doses) of treatment. At data cut-off, the median length of treatment was 6.5 weeks (1-32+). All the patients presented with at least one adverse event (AE) and six patients with a severe AE (SAE). One partial response and 5 stable diseases were observed. The median OS was 6.4 months (95% CI, 4.8 to 12 months). The median and mean vinorelbine's AUC were 122 ng/ml*h and 159 ng/mlz.ast;h, respectively, with the higher plasmatic vinorelbine exposure associated with the best ORR (difference of AUC comparison between responders and non-responders, p-value 0.017).

Design/methodology/approach - The overall shapes of pores were modeled by triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS), and the micro-roughness details attached to the overall pore shapes were represented by Weierstrass-Mandelbrot (W-M) fractal representation, which was integrated with TPMS along its normal vectors. An index roughly reflecting the irregularity of fractal TPMS was proposed, based on which the influence of the fractal parameters on the fractal TPMS was qualitatively analyzed. Two complex samples of real porous structures were given to demonstrate the feasibility of the model. Findings - The fractal surface topography should not be neglected at a micro-scale level. In addition, a decrease in the fractal dimension Ds may exponentially make the topography rougher; an increase in the height-scaling parameter G may linearly increase the roughness; and the number of the superposed ridges has no distinct influence on the topography. Furthermore, the synthesis method is general for all implicit surfaces. Practical implications - The method provides an alternative way to shift the posteriori design paradigm of porous media to priori design mode through numeric simulation.

Additionally, Mathematic software was used to conduct numerical simulation. Results indicate that in an unsteady stage, the temperature field gradually propagated in the coal seam, and that the propagation rate became steady after a gradual increase. The time required for the temperature field in the coal seam undergoing gasification to transform from the unsteady to the steady state was inversely proportional to the advance rate of the flame working face. During the stages of temperature increase and decrease, the temperature field in the roof, floor, and surrounding coal seam gradually moved towards the interior. During the temperature increase stage, the peak of the temperature field occurred on the surface of the surrounding rock and gradually increased; it also moved inward from the surface and gradually decreased during the temperature decrease stage. The temperature decrease stage had greater influence on the temperature field in the roof, floor, and surrounding seam than the temperature increase stage. The influence of the temperature increase stage was related to the advance rate of the flame working face; this influence is negligible when the advance rate of the flame working face exceeded a threshold value. Finally, based on the features of the envelope curves of temperature curve families, the ranges of the surrounding coal seam with no load-bearing capacity and coking cycle were obtained, as were after determination of their respective criteria and temperature threshold values. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS","Laplace transform; Temperature field distribution; Underground coal gasification","Carbonization; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal gasification; Coking; Computer software; Floors; Laplace transforms; Roofs; Stoping; Distribution characteristics; Inverse Laplace transform; Temperature curves; Temperature decrease; Temperature field distribution; Temperature increase; Temperature threshold value; Underground coal gasification; Temperature"

Many of these fires grew rapid to catastrophic size. Smoke as well as toxic gases from burnt materials are very dangerous to tunnel users. Based on the above, vitally important to forecast the ability of the amount of combustion products identified for different fire scenarios in underground. It is obvious that the development of fires mostly depends on the goods that are burned, although ventilation has a major effect. Ventilation on the one hand gives the oxygen to the fire areas and on the other hand neutralizes combustion products by reducing their concentrations. By means of mathematic modelling we investigated processes of the fires with different magnitude. Solution of the issue is topical to the operational staff of tunnels and emergency services for planning and implementation of the adequate measures for tunnel fire safety and asset protection. These studies aim to clarify two issues: 1. What is the impact on the spread of smoke during natural and mechanical ventilation of tunnel and how the speed of flow that is result of modelling, corresponds to similar facts of real fires that have occurred in the tunnels and which are available? 2. How to facilitate the operational staff of tunnel in rapid actions and what instruments we would suggest them for the estimation and the management of emergency situations in case of accident?

Along with the urbanization, the energy consumption has significantly increased in the recent decades. The resulting anthropogenic heat emission can lead to significant changes in the surface thermal environment on different temporal and spatial scales. We reviewed the related references, and concluded that three methods, including source inventory, mathematical modeling, and surface energy balance, have been used for evaluating anthropogenic heat emission. Current studies are mainly focused on the city, regional, and global scales. The studies conducted on the city scale are concentrated on the temporal dynamics of anthropogenic heat emission, whereas those conducted on the regional and global scales pay close attention to the spatial heterogeneity of anthropogenic heat emission. The regional and global research also focuses on the contribution of anthropogenic heat emission to the global warming and potential climate adaption strategies. After reviewing the related references, we concluded four categories of weak points in the current studies of anthropogenic heat emission. To better understand and quantify the impact of anthropogenic heat emission on the surface thermal environment, we suggest several improvements in the future studies. First, the research conclusions of anthropogenic heat emission depend on different evaluation methods, and they are not easy to evaluate and compare with each other. Although the statistical and mathematic models can assess the anthropogenic heat emission, the in situ monitoring and enormous data collection (Big Data) would better supplement the quantification of anthropogenic heat emission. Second, the research conclusions on city scales cannot be compared with those on the regional and global scales. Selecting appropriate methods for evaluating anthropogenic heat emission should be based on specific temporal and spatial scales. Third, the impact of anthropogenic heat emission lacks connection with landscape ecology. The theories of landscape ecology, such as patch-corridor-matrix, provide useful implications to improve the research on anthropogenic heat emission. Last, the impact of the intensity and dynamics of anthropogenic heat emission on the urban thermal environment have not been quantified enough in the current studies. Thus, it is crucial to understand the anthropogenic heat emission in different scientific fields including ecology, environment science, and building technology. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

To assess stress-reactivity of males younger than 55 y. o. with high normal blood pressure (HNBP) and arterial hypertension (AH) and possible influence on asymptomatic atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness. Material and methods. Into the study, males were included of age 40-55 y. o. According to blood pressure level (BP), they were selected to groups: 1st group included 91 men with HNBP, 2nd - 89 men with the diagnosed AH and reached target BP. The cardiovascular risk factors were assessed, as intima-media thickness of brachiocephalic vessels (BCV), velocity of carotid-femoral pulse wave. Stress-test was done with the ""mathematic count"", and the increased reactivity was defined as increase of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or heart rate (HR) by >7% and >10%, respectively, during the test. Statistics was done with Statistica 6.0 (StatSoft Inc.). Results. An increased stress-reactivity was found in 34,7% of patients with HNBP and 22,5% with AH. Abdominal obesity patients had higher increase of SBP and HR by 4,1% (p=0,01) and 5,8% (p=0,01), respectively.

The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to examine the key factors that influence project failure and an analysis of the major areas that can have a significant impact on success; and second, to explore some of the key aspects that have an impact on project management performance from the practitioner perspective and discusses the problems faced by organizations in the closer integration of change and project management. Design/methodology/approach: This study critically reviews the IS failure literature developing a synthesized view of the key issues and common reasons for projects to fail. The approach taken in this study is one that focuses on a number of key questions that pull together the relevant themes in this genre of research whilst highlighting many of the implications for practitioners and organizations alike. Findings: Key questions remain on the underlying causes of instances of poor project management as an IS failure factor. The literature has omitted to develop a deeper analysis of the associations between failure factors and the potential causal relationships between these factors. The realization of project benefits relies on the success of both change and project management yet the formal integration of these two disciplines is constrained by separate standards bodies and an immature body of research. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited by its theoretical nature lacking an empirical element to provide a deeper analysis of IS failure factors and their interrelationships. This specific area is a recommendation for future research, where causal relationships between failure factors could be developed via a mathematic-based method such as interpretive structural modeling. Practical implications: With failure rates of IS projects still unacceptably high after decades of attempts to significantly change outcomes, a deeper analysis of this topic is required. The research gaps and recommendations for practitioners highlighted in this study have the potential to provide valuable contributions to this topic of research. Originality/value: The intent of this study is to present a new perspective of this genre of IS research that develops the main arguments and gaps in the literature from the practitioner viewpoint. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Failure factors; IS project failure; Project management",

This task was realized under the special Executive Order of the Government of Russia N 523-r, 2014, April, 4. According to passport characteristics ILC samples are the lyophilized human sera, inactivated by heating (1 hour at 56°C) and stabilized by the mixture of sucrose (5%) and ProClin-3000 as the conservation agent. Samples are free of HBs Ag, anti-HVC, T.Pallidum, HIV-1/2, HIV-1Ag p24.The aim of the study was to evaluate the possibility of using the ILC for detection of the MRV IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA with commercial ELISA kits used in Russia and CIS countries. In the process of detecting the specific activity of ""Measles-IgM, ser.1"", ""Measles-IgM, ser.2"" and ""Rubella-IgM"" by ELISA kits of different formats (Vector Best, EcoLab and Siemens Companies) the statistically different results were received (p < 0.05). The optical density (OD) values of IgM in the ""Measles-IgM, ser.1"" and ""Measles-IgM, ser.2"" ILC, obtained by ELISA ""VectoMeasles IgM"" (Vector Best) were significantly higher than those obtained by ELISA IgEnzygnost®Anti-MeaslesVirus/IgM. These values consisted for the ser. 1-1.33±0.02 o.u. vs. 0.18±0.01 o.u. (p < 0.05) and for the ser. 2-2.83±0.03 o.u. vs. 0.7±0.02 o.e. (p < 0.05) in the Vector Best and Siemens ELISA kits correspondently. In the ""Rubella-IgM"" ILC the OD values of the specific IgM by the ""ELISA-Rubella IgM"" EcoLab were also higher than those obtained by IgEnzygnost®Anti-RubellaVirus/IgM ELISA kit. These values consisted 2.92±0.04 o.u. vs. 0.88±0.03 o.u. (p < 0.05) in EcoLab and Siemens ELISA test-systems correspondently. In the studies when the ILC working solution parameters for ELISA of ""capture"" and ""indirect"" formats were evaluated the statistic reliability and high information capability of the mathematic models of the OD value changes vs. the degree of dilution of the initial ILC were determined. For the ""capture"" and ""indirect"" formats the determination coefficient (R2) consisted 97.34 and 99.29 correspondently, the Fisher criteria (F) - 219.62 and 556.55 correspondently, the significance level (p) -< 0.05 for both formats. The evaluated optimal working dilution degrees of the IgM-containing ILC make possible to exclude the influence of the IgG antibodies as the non-target marker in the ILC. On the other hand, taking into account the format of the used ELISA kit the optimal working dilution degrees give the possibility to obtain the desirable 2-3 ""cut-off"" values of the specific marker. Moreover, the issue of the target marker quantitative content in ILC is discussed in the study. In order to improve the quality of the commercial MRV IgM and IgG ELISA test-systems the joint studies with those who develop and produce these systems are desirable to be organized.","ELISA test-system; In-house; Laboratory control; Measles; Rubella; Specific IgM and IgG antibodies",

Accumulated evidence suggests that the reaction path of PKMT-catalyzed methylation consists of the formation of a cofactor(cosubstrate)-PKMT-substrate complex, lysine deprotonation through dynamic water channels, and a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) transition state for transmethylation. However, the molecular characters of the proposed process remain to be elucidated experimentally. Here we developed a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) method and corresponding mathematic matrix to determine precisely the ratios of isotopically methylated peptides. This approach may be generally applicable for examining the kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) of posttranslational modifying enzymes.

We therefore implemented the MSbased method to measure KIEs and binding isotope effects (BIEs) of the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) for SET8-catalyzed H4K20 monomethylation. A primary intrinsic 13C KIE of 1.04, an inverse intrinsic α-secondary CD3 KIE of 0.90, and a small but statistically significant inverse CD3 BIE of 0.96, in combination with computational modeling, revealed that SET8-catalyzed methylation proceeds through an early, asymmetrical SN2 transition state with the C-N and C-S distances of 2.35-2.40 A and 2.00-2.05 A, respectively. This transition state is further supported by the KIEs, BIEs, and steadystate kinetics with the SAM analog Se-adenosyl-L-selenomethionine (SeAM) as a cofactor surrogate. The distinct transition states between protein methyltransferases present the opportunity to design selective transition-state analog inhibitors.","BIE; KIE; Methylation; PKMT; PMT",

The tendency of adopting machine learning, big data science, cloud computation in various industries depends on unsupervised learning on data structures to tell the story about consumers' behavior, fraud detection, and market segmentation. Fuzzy clustering contrasts with hard clustering by its nonlinear nature and discipline of flexibility in grouping massive data. It provides more accurate and close-to-nature solutions for partitions and herein implies more possibility of solutions for decision-making. In the specific matter of computation, fuzzy clustering has its roots in fuzzy logic and indicates the likelihood or degrees of one data point belonging to more than one group. This paper focuses on the study of models of fuzzy clustering in various cases. Uniquely designed algorithms enhance the accuracy of outcomes and are worth studying to assist future work. In some case scenarios, modeling processes are data-driven and place emphasis on the distances between points and new centers of clusters. In some other cases, which aim at market segmentation or evaluation of patients by healthcare records, membership degree is a key element in the algorithm.

The explosion process of LIB can be viewed as a rheology-mutation process. The process of safety rheology with time can be divided into three stages: decelerated, stable and accelerated growth stage, respectively. The physical model and mathematic model were built to estimate the probability of LIB explosion based on the rheology-mutation theory. The influence of different parameters, like external force, strength coefficient and wear coefficient, on probability of LIB explosion were discussed. The results showed that the external force is the most important parameter which controls the overall growth trend of the probability of LIB explosion. Strength coefficient determines the resistance of LIB to the external stimulation. Wear coefficient controls the rate of rheology and mutation. The external forces, strength coefficient and wear coefficient were influenced by the factors, which lead to the LIB explosion. In order to analyze these factors, a fault tree of LIB explosion was built. The minimum cut sets and the structure importance degree coefficient of each basic event were calculated through Boolean algebra method. The collision is the most important factor that influences the LIB explosion.

The conventional channel-aware encryption (CAE) is an efficient physical-layer secure distributed detection scheme in light of its energy efficiency, good scalability and robustness over diverse eavesdropping scenarios. However, in the CAE scheme, it remains an open problem of how to optimize the key thresholds for the estimated channel gain, which are used to determine the sensor’s reporting action. Moreover, the CAE scheme does not jointly consider the accuracy of local detection results in determining whether to stay dormant for a sensor. To solve these problems, we first analyze the error probability and derive the optimal thresholds in the CAE scheme under a specified energy constraint. These results build a convenient mathematic framework for our further innovative design. Under this framework, we propose a hybrid secure distributed detection scheme. Our proposal can satisfy the energy constraint by keeping some sensors inactive according to the local detection confidence level, which is characterized by likelihood ratio. In the meanwhile, the security is guaranteed through randomly flipping the local decisions forwarded to the fusion center based on the channel amplitude. We further optimize the key parameters of our hybrid scheme, including two local decision thresholds and one channel comparison threshold. Performance evaluation results demonstrate that our hybrid scheme outperforms the CAE under stringent energy constraints, especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio scenario, while the security is still assured. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Decision fusion; Distributed detection; Eavesdropping; Energy constraint; Internet of things; Physical layer security; Wireless sensor network","Cryptography; Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Network layers; Problem solving; Security systems; Signal to noise ratio; Wireless sensor networks; Decision fusion; Distributed detection; Eavesdropping; Energy constraint; Physical layer security; Network security"

In this paper, an innovative adaptive dynamic programming approach, namely goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP), was proposed to design supplementary damping controller (SDC) of voltage source converter HVDC (VSC-HVDC) transmission system to suppress inter-area oscillation in large-scale AC/DC power system. Based on the two neural networks structure of HDP, GrHDP developed a new goal representation network, able to automatically generate internal adaptive reward signal to facilitate better mapping between system state and control action. Therefore, GrHDP-SDC could significantly improve dynamic performance of power system. Not necessarily knowing exact mathematic model of the power system, GrHDP-SDC possessed quick learning and universal control characteristics and strong adaptability, superior to conventional lead-lag SDC. Case study was performed based on a two-area four-machine power system with VSC-HVDC transmission line. Conventional lead-lag SDC and HDP-SDC were also studied for comparison.

Through the establishment of mathematic models, network clustering problems are transformed into combination optimization ones. Additionally, the search space of particles is constructed as the binary N-dimensional space that works as cluster heads. The search speed of particles decides the probability that nodes become cluster heads. Meanwhile, a fitness function is designed under the situation of energy replenishment. Parameter adjustment increases the energy efficiency of nodes and maintains the loading balance of clustering, which makes the nodes whose energy harvesting ability is high become cluster heads with a priority. Finally, optimal cluster heads will be decided through multiple iterations, which stands for the accomplishment of clustering and saves cluster-head energy and balances node loading. The simulation results show that SOL-BPSO algorithm effectively balances the energy consumption of nodes and extends the life cycle of network while energy replenishment is considered. Therefore, the network life cycle of SOL-BPSO algorithm is 12.5% longer than that of PHC algorithm.

The traditional control approaches, for example PID control method, however, cannot meet the cooling demands with the satisfactory energy efficiency as well. This paper presents a novel energy-efficiency-oriented cascade control strategy for the VCC systems to improve the energy efficiency and fulfill the cooling requirements of indoor occupants simultaneously. In outer loop, a mathematic model is developed to determine the set point of superheat by a PI controller based on the nonlinear correlation between cooling demands and superheat degree. In inner loop, the pressure difference and superheat degree of evaporator are controlled by a model predictive control (MPC) strategy to track the values which are determined in the outer loop, simultaneously to enhance system efficiency of the VCC systems. Simulation and experiments studies are carried out to show the effectiveness of this proposed cascade control strategy and the results indicate significant tracking performance and energy efficiency improvements on VCC system.

A mathematic model capable of calculating the variable cycle engine steady and transition performance was established. It considered the local total pressure loss caused by sudden area change at forward bypass injector and mode selector valve. The impacts of geometry regulating laws of forward and rear bypass injectors on variable cycle engine performance and stability were simulated with single bypass mode, double bypass mode and mode transitioning, and the simulation results were compared with NASA test data. The results indicate the opening of forward bypass injector's inner bypass area can decrease recirculation margin and increase fan and core drive fan stage surge margin in single bypass mode. During the late period of transforming from single into double bypass mode, the reduction of fan pressure ratio will diminish by closing rear bypass injector's outer bypass area. It's suggested that the forward bypass injector's inner bypass area should be changed, and the total area should be kept unchanged, while the rear bypass injector's outer bypass area should be changed, and the inner bypass area should be kept unchanged. © 2016, Editorial Department of Journal of Aerospace Power.

In spite of all the information amassed on the antigenic and immunological characteristics of the virus, the disease has notyet been brought fully under control. It is still prevalent in properly vaccinated flocks carrying specific antibodies at levels normally high enough to prevent the disease. Common causes apart, failure of vaccination against infectious bursal disease is associated mainly with early vaccination in flocks of unknown immune status and with the evolution of viruses circulating in the field, leading to antigenic drift and a sharp rise in pathogenicity. Various highly sensitive molecular techniques have clarified the viral determinants of antigenicity and pathogenicity of the infectious bursal disease virus. However, these markers are not universally recognised and tend to be considered as evolutionary markers. Antigenic variants of the infectious bursal disease virus possess modified neutralising epitopes that allow them to evade the action of maternally-derived or vaccine-induced antibodies. Autogenous or multivalent vaccines are required to control antigenic variants in areas where classical and variant virus strains coexist. Pathotypic variants (very virulent viruses) remain antigenically related to classical viruses. The difficulty in controlling pathotypic variants is linked to the difficulty of eliciting an early immune response, because of the risk of the vaccine virus being neutralised by maternal antibodies. Mathematical calculation of the optimal vaccination time and the use of vaccines resistant to maternally-derived antibodies have improved the control of very virulent viruses.","Antigenic variant; Gumboro disease; Infectious bursal disease; Mutation; Pathotypic variant; Vaccination failure; Virus",

The adapt DB-PSO patterns clustering algorithms (ADPCA) combined the particle swarm optimization (PSO) clustering algorithm and adapt DB_index measuring methodology to efficiently decide the real number of clusters, cluster centers, and then to recognize the correct catalog even if there are exiting some cases in various shapes, multi-dimension, real life training patterns and image datasets. In general, the PSO is adapted for dealing complex and global optimization problems. The population-based evolutional PSO learning algorithm with the self-adapt mathematic index can fit the data vibration to perform the real criterion of homogeneity of neighboring pixels in many image vision and understanding cases. Owing to the purpose of generating automatic clustering algorithms, the specific fitness function contains the DB_validity measure to significantly improve resolutions of spatial information among the given training patterns. The computation of image DB_index is delivered to retrieve the specific objects by evaluating the characters of given patterns. The novel ADPCA actually indicate the homogeneity region of interesting pictures and eliminate small pieces of elements by the supports of DB index measure, which can be used to dynamically compute the maximal similarity and small difference of the discussed image patterns. Several artificial datasets include the three-dimensional dataset with five spherical clusters, two-dimensional patterns with three different sizes circles, one Chtree Fractal image patterns, one real life IRIS data and one grey level image data, which are given as training patterns to demonstrate the adaptation and efficiency of the ADPCA learning method. It presents that ADPCA determine the correct clustering number and suitable cluster position in different data clustering examples. Two image segmentation applications also show that ADPCA can achieve correct detection of subjects. In conclusion, several simulations compared with the traditional k-means algorithm demonstrate the great results of ADPCA learning machine. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Clustering algorithm; DB validity; Image segmentation; Particle swarm optimization","Algorithms; Global optimization; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Population statistics; Artificial datasets; Automatic clustering algorithm; DB validity; Global optimization problems; Homogeneity regions; Image applications; Spatial informations; Two-dimensional patterns; Clustering algorithms"

Considering the restriction of the limited budget, the non-commercial open-source simulation software often becomes the top choice of academia. Since the natures of academic study are innovation and excellence, a simulator frequently encounters that the existing modular functions are inadequate and need to be appended or modified. If a selected simulator inherently has poor architecture, the maintenance, recondition, and expansion of functions will become more difficult and more time-consuming in the future, while it is difficult to understand and reuse by the successors. Therefore, how to select a most suitable simulator is an important issue. In order to make a simulator have flexible architecture and believable results, design patterns are proposed as the norms to design system architecture. To realize this idea, we surveyed six most used simulators, i.e., J-Sim, NS-2, NS-3, OMNet++, OPNET, and QualNet, to ponder their system architectures and design concepts from the source codes and the related literatures of the modular function expansion. We propose a network simulator architecture, named as CCGns, which is a discrete-event virtual network simulator and follows the IEEE 802.16-2009 standard. CCGns obeys the object-oriented design principles and is coded by the Java language. CCGns comprises eight packages for physical layer, medium access control layer, network layer, devices, topologies, events, scheduler, and reports, respectively. The main contribution includes three aspects which propose a scalable MAC messages management and the corresponding architecture, an applicable for multi-hop relay network topology architecture, and a two-stage minimum variance bandwidth allocation algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this article is not the first one to apply the design patterns for the simulator architectures of wireless network, but we use more design patterns and types than the others and also provide the unified modeling language figures to explain the system architectures. We particularly focus on how the management procedure of control messages influences the time-related performance evaluation metrics, e.g., how the amount and processing time of different control messages affect throughput, packet delay, and packet drop ratio. By using mathematic calculation to verify the simulation results, the proposed system architecture has been proven to possess excellent fidelity. © 2016, Lee et al.","Design pattern; Object-oriented design; Simulator; Unified modeling language; WiMAX","Access control; Budget control; Computational linguistics; Computer architecture; Computer software; Design; Function evaluation; Java programming language; Medium access control; Modeling languages; Network layers; Object oriented programming; Open source software; Open systems; Simulators; Topology; Unified Modeling Language; Wimax; Wireless networks; Bandwidth allocation algorithms; Design Patterns; Flexible architectures; Medium access control layer; Multi-hop relay networks; Object oriented design; Performance evaluation metrics; Virtual network simulators; Network architecture"

By integrating the arts into STEM, a four-part origami based curriculum has been developed, which combines the topics of renewable energy, architecture design, 3D CAD design and printing, and mathematic, science, and engineering principles. The modules are composed of familiar engineering education tactics to get students to think outside of the box like an engineer. Students reverse engineer origami pieces, build an origami chair using the design process, and learn the topic of renewable energies through interactive games. The final module pulls the knowledge gained from the first three together. The students design and 3D print origami structures that are energy efficient and utilizes at least one source of renewable energy. Students go through the design process with brainstorming, prototyping, and working models. The K-12 Next Generation Science Standards for science and engineering has eight practices. Origami Meets STEAM practices all eight including: (1) Asking questions and defining problems, (2) Developing and using models, (3) Planning and carrying out investigations, and (6) Instructing explanations and designing solutions.

This decomposition is necessary because practical limitations in radio implementation prevent the relay from simultaneously transmitting and receiving on the same channel. K relays in RCD require K+1 channels which shows that as the number of relays increases the number of required channels increases linearly. This increase in channels gives fundamental drawback in all cooperative diversity networks. So if this problem is not addressed the cooperative diversity networks will lose attractiveness for high data rate, high efficiency communications. In this paper this problem is addressed tried to find a solution. The performance of the best-relay selection scheme will be examined in which only the 'best' relay takes part in relaying, therefore only two channels take part in transmission regardless of the number of relays. The relay node that gives the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination node is considered to be the best relay. A general mathematic probability model is presented and examined the performance of best-relay selection using amplify and forward (AF) scheme. © 2016 IEEE.","AF; RCD; SNR and Best Relay selection","Cochannel interference; Cooperative communication; Fading (radio); Fading channels; Optical communication; Rayleigh fading; Amplify-and-forward; Best-relay selections; Co-operative diversity; Cooperative diversity networks; Information signals; Orthogonal channels; Performance analysis; Probability modeling; Signal to noise ratio"

It is composed of a wheel system and a rubber track. In order to avoid de-tracking and excessive tension of the track and make the track perimeter match the wheel system, a modeling method of rubber track perimeter is developed which is based on variations in relative location of each wheel of the wheel system. In this method, the track perimeter is divided into two kinds of segments, circular arc segment that is in contact with wheels and deformation segment which does not contact with wheels. If a deformation segment does not contact with the raised obstacle, then it is a straight line, otherwise it is a circular arc. The effect of the roller wheel swing on the perimeter of the track is studied and the matching tensioning device is designed to maintain the track perimeter constant while roller wheels swing. Under multi-terrain conditions, multi-camera videogrammetric system is used to track feature points on each wheel of the wheel system and coordinates of feature points are collected to reconstruct the axis of each wheel, and then the track perimeter is modelled. Experimental results on a flat steel plate show that because of the uneven track bending stiffness, the modelled average perimeter of the track is 3 791.62 mm with standard deviation of 3.51 mm, which is slightly smaller than the actual perimeter 3 812 mm of the track. Experimental results under multi-terrain conditions are consistent with those on a flat steel plate, the standard deviations are all about 3.5 mm and the average perimeters of the track are all in the range of 3 787.78 mm to 3 794.75 mm. Therefore, this modeling method of rubber track perimeter is effective, robust, free from the impact of terrain, and it also provides the basis for the design and assessment of the rubber track assembly. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Based on the investigation of the problem of surplus torque caused by position disturbance of the loaded system, this paper designs a feedforward compensation control method based on the output angular velocity of the loaded system. A compensation method is then developed on the basis of dead-inverse by considering friction nonlinearity of the loaded system. In addition, with respect to the problem of amplitude attenuation and phase lag of ETLS, this paper adopts an amplitude and phase control (APC) algorithm based on the least mean square error (LMSE) technique to improve the loading performance of ETLS. The APC algorithm based on the sigmoid function adaptive-step LMSE algorithm is subsequently proposed, with the aim of reducing the contradiction of step required by the convergence rate and steady precision, thereby improving the performance of the entire algorithm. Finally, a series of simulations and experiments are conducted, and results show that the developed disturbance torque suppression and loading performance improvement method are effective.

This paper presents a novel method to adapt recycled plastic for demanding industrial applications by designing suitable formulae which satisfy the technical requirements of the applications. To illustrate the proposed method which combines hierarchical clustering analysis and principal component estimate, actual requirements of some selected automobile parts were acquired and benchmarked in this study. Two common particle fillers – talcum powder and organically modified montmorillonite were added in recycled polypropylene with maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene as a compatibiliser. The initial compositions were selected according to the specific composition selection rules which are adapted from Taguchi method for reducing the number of trials. Corresponding mechanical, rheological, and thermal properties were tested based upon the technical requirements of selected automobile parts. The interrelationships between multiple objectives (requirements) were analysed and classified by hierarchical clustering analysis, and then the total number of requirements were reduced. Effects of each component were identified numerically by principal component estimate, and a corresponding linear regression model was obtained. The linear regression model was compared to other linear regression models which obtained by other mathematic techniques, and it has been proved to be the best model which has the smallest gap between predicted values and experimental results. Optimal formulae were calculated via linear programming with the objects of minimising material cost and satisfying the reduced technical requirements of selected automobile parts. In verification tests, the experimental performance of the obtained formulae closely matched the model predictions. The proposed formula design method is novel and original, and it is shown to be effective and efficient in designing recycled plastic based composites for demanding industrial applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Decision support system; Hierarchical cluster analysis; Manufacturing; Polypropylene; Principal component estimate","Artificial intelligence; Automobiles; Cluster analysis; Decision support systems; Elastomers; Estimation; Hierarchical systems; Injection molding; Linear programming; Linear regression; Manufacture; Plastic products; Plastics industry; Polypropylenes; Recycling; Regression analysis; Scrap metal reprocessing; Taguchi methods; Talc; Hierarchical cluster analysis; Hierarchical clustering analysis; Linear regression models; Maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene; Manufacturing industries; Organically modified montmorillonite; Principal Components; Recycled polypropylene; Principal component analysis"

In this article, the effect of moisture on sewage sludge combustion temperature profile and heavy metal leaching behavior has been experimentally studied. The temperature profiles inside the sludge pellet were recorded, and the volume shrinkage was obtained by image processing method. Results revealed that combustion rate and burnout of sludge strongly depends on moisture content and there exists an optimal moisture content for sludge incineration with respect to best combustion performance and minimum heavy metal leaching. The enlarged pore size may account for this moisture rate, that is, 48% for the sludge studied. During combustion, the shrinkage rate varied from 15 to 25%, and it was found to be proportional with moisture content. The cross-section image of burning sludge pellet illustrated that during the drying and combustion stage, the moisture evaporation was running parallel with the decomposition of volatile that was burned out in the vicinity of the sludge surface. Measured temperature profiles indicate that effect of volatile combustion on inner temperature profile was ignorable.

These new methods are examined and compared with two GP methods with loops and a standard GP method on three mathematic/symbolic regression problems including repeating characteristics and three artificial Ant problems. The results show that the new methods outperform the two GP methods with loops and standard GP on all these problems in terms of the correctness of the evolved solutions and evolutionary training time.

The prepared resveratrol nanosuspensions (Res-NSs) were distributed in DGG solutions. Parameters such as the in situ gelation capability, particle size, rheological properties, and texture profiles were used to describe the properties of the in situ gel. Pharmacokinetic and brain-targeting efficiency studies were performed after intranasal and intravenous administration, respectively. Biodistribution and localization using in vivo imaging systems and fluorescence microscopy are also described. The formulation containing 0.6% w/v DGG displayed a favorable gelling ability and the desired viscosity. The rheology results established that the DGG in situ gel possesses the characteristics of shear thinning, thixotropy and yield stress. The results of the textural profile revealed an increase in adhesiveness and viscosity for the in situ gel compared to the DGG solution. In vitro penetration studies followed a Higuchi mathematic model. Pharmacokinetics revealed a 2.88-times increase of bioavailability in the brain by intranasal Res-NSs in situ gel formulation. The drug targeting efficiency (458.2%) and direct transport percentages (78.18%) demonstrated direct delivery via the nose-brain pathway. The distribution and localization further illustrated the existence of direct nose-to-brain transport, bypassing the BBB.

This work examines various atomistic formulations for local stress and their inconsistencies. Using standard mathematic theorems and the law of mechanics, we show that Cauchy stress results unambiguously from the definition of internal force density, thereby removing the long-standing confusion about the atomistic basis of the fundamental property of Cauchy stress and leading to a new atomistic formula for local stress The new atomistic stress formula has clear physical meaning and well-defined values, satisfies the conservation law, and is fully consistent with the concept of Cauchy stress.

In recent years, several biota and environmental features of the Colombian Páramos have been described. Nevertheless, despite these advances, many relevant features such as leaf morphoecology of Páramo vegetation remain poorly understood. In particular, leaf morphology in Páramo plants has been sparsely described. Traditionally, leaf morphological description has been based on visual categorical systems, which can be highly biased by expert's opinion. In recent years, an objective method based on elliptic Fourier transforms and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been adopted by ecologists and phytologists to quantitatively assess leaf shape morphology. This approach is critically held on the idea that the leaf margin can be described as a closed contour, although, such assumption is not satisfied by several Páramo plant species because a considerable percentage of them are characterized by sessile leaves, i.e., leaves without petiole. Sessile leaves can be only described by using open contours. In this work, we propose a shape description for open contours based on p-type Fourier representations and PCA. The method was evaluated on 115 Páramo leaves from 12 species and compared with related approaches. The results show that the proposed method is able to capture high levels of variability and improve the mathematic representation of shape when compared to conventional methods based on simple geometrical quantities and elliptic Fourier transform descriptors. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Colombian Páramo; Elliptic Fourier; Leaf morphology; Open contours; P-type","biome; contour map; ellipse; Fourier transform; geometry; leaf morphology; Neotropical Kingdom; principal component analysis; quantitative analysis; tundra"

However, apparently, it is not sufficient to make final decision only depending on environmental assessment results for profit-directed organizations. One of the main purposes of this paper is to propose a methodology for integration of LCA and economic analysis tool-life cycle costing (LCC) in order to get the integrated evaluation results. A framework of integration of LCA and LCC has been introduced, which is contained by four components: the definition of unity time and physical boundaries, integration of inventory analysis, integration of impact assessment, environmental and economic interpretation. However, the integrated evaluation results always indicate that the relationship between economic and environmental performance is not in balance. Optimization is as important as integration to eco-balance. An optimization method is proposed to improve the initial product design with maximizing the integrated environmental and economic benefit for mechanical product. In optimization step, product system is divided two parts with environmental subsystem and economic subsystem. The integrated evaluation results are adopted to support for the optimization. Some mathematic optimization models are set up for environmental and economic subsystems. Multidisciplinary design optimization is applied to optimize these models so that the initial mechanical product design can achieve the best environmental and economic performance result.

A multicenter validation of a proposed semiautomatic method for hyperintense MS lesion segmentation on dual-echo MR imaging is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The classification technique used is based on a region-growing approach starting from manual lesion identification by an expert observer with a final segmentation-refinement step. The method was validated in a cohort of 52 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, with dual-echo images acquired in 6 different European centers. RESULTS: We found a mathematic expression that made the optimization of the method independent of the need for a training dataset. The automatic segmentation was in good agreement with the manual segmentation (dice similarity coefficient = 0.62 and root mean square error = 2 mL). Assessment of the segmentation errors showed no significant differences in algorithm performance between the different MR scanner manufacturers (P ≥ .05).

In different studies, the pathophysiology connection of QC to various diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) was described. Algae are known for the ability to synthesize complex and highly-diverse compounds with specific enzyme inhibition properties. Therefore, we screened different algae species for the presence of QC inhibiting metabolites using a new ""Reverse Metabolomics"" technique including an Activity-correlation Analysis (AcorA), which is based on the correlation of bioactivities to mass spectral data with the aid of mathematic informatics deconvolution. Thus, three QC inhibiting compounds from microalgae belonging to the family of sulfolipids were identified. The compounds showed a QC inhibition of 81% and 76% at concentrations of 0.25 mg/mL and 0.025 mg/mL, respectively. Thus, for the first time, sulfolipids are identified as QC inhibiting compounds and possess substructures with the required pharmacophore qualities.

Selection pressure resulted from sedimentation and discharge processes is a decisive factor of aerobic granulation. Thus, on the basis of the Lotka–Volterra competition equation and selection pressure, a mathematic model was established to simulate the aerobic granulation process in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The sensitivity of the mean diameter toward the minimum settling velocity (VS) and the maximum specific growth rate (μmax) is analyzed. The selection coefficient was predicted in the case of VS = 20 cm min−1 and VS = 40 cm min−1, respectively. The growth of biomass is calculated based on diffusion and reaction theory. The model is also able to predict variation rate and size distribution of bioparticle. The results indicated that VS can control the granulation process and the characteristics of granules. The model evaluation results demonstrate that the developed model is applicable to simulating the aerobic granulation process appropriately.

Deterministic techniques based on mathematic programming become invalid when the models are non-differentiable or explicit mathematical descriptions do not exist. Recently, evolutionary algorithms are gaining popularity for DOPs as they can be used as robust alternatives when the deterministic techniques are invalid. In this article, a technology named ranking-based mutation operator (RMO) is presented to enhance the previous differential evolution (DE) algorithms to solve DOPs using control vector parameterization. In the RMO, better individuals have higher probabilities to produce offspring, which is helpful for the performance enhancement of DE algorithms. Three DE-RMO algorithms are designed by incorporating the RMO. The three DE-RMO algorithms and their three original DE algorithms are applied to solve four constrained DOPs from the literature. Our simulation results indicate that DE-RMO algorithms exhibit better performance than previous non-ranking DE algorithms and other four evolutionary algorithms. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Control vector parameterization; Differential evolution; Dynamic optimization; Ranking-based mutation operator","Differential equations; Optimization; Control vector parameterization; Differential Evolution; Differential evolution algorithms; Dynamic optimization; Dynamic optimization problem (DOP); Mathematical descriptions; Mutation operators; Performance enhancements; Evolutionary algorithms"

First, an inner vial cap was designed as a cooling device for acceptor droplet in HS-SDME unit to achieve fast and efficient microextraction. Second, for the first time, an in-vial TG was generated between the donor phase in a sample vial at 80 °C and the acceptor droplet under the inner vial cap containing cooling liquid at -20 °C for a TG-HS-SDME. Third, a simple mathematic model and numerical simulations were developed by using heat transfer in fluids, Navier-Stokes and mass balance equations for conditional optimization, and dynamic illumination of the proposed extraction based on COMSOL Multiphysics. Five chlorophenols (CPs) were selected as model analytes to authenticate the proposed method. The comparisons revealed that the simulative results were in good agreement with the quantitative experiments, verifying the design of TG-HS-SDME via the numerical simulation. Under the optimum conditions, the extraction enrichments were improved from 302- to 388-fold within 2 min only, providing 3.5 to 4 times higher enrichment factors as compared to a typical HS-SDME. The simulation indicated that these improvements in the extraction kinetics could be attributed due to the applied temperature gap between the sample matrix and acceptor droplet within the small volume of headspace. Additionally, the experiments demonstrated a good linearity (0.03-100 μg/L, R2 &gt; 0.9986), low limit of detection (7-10 ng/L), and fair repeatability (&lt;5.9% RSD, n = 6).

A numerical iteration method was developed to solve the coupling model so as to obtain pressure distribution of the fluid film and surface deformation. The influence of structural parameters of the tapered end face on sealing performance was analyzed at various working conditions. The results showed that diamond-shaped pores created dynamic pressure effect, which produced circular and radial wave deformation at the end faces, and static pressure effect, which changed impact accordingly within the end face region with the increase of taper Ф and cone width ratio γ. The convergent seal of the tapered end face at Ф=5-6 or Ф=2-4 and γ=0.8-1.0 should be selected for low pressure and low to medium speed equipment. The convergent seal of the cone end face at Ф=2-3 and γ=1.0 or γ=0.2 should be selected for high pressure and high speed equipment. Changing tapered end face structure could effectively modify characteristic parameters of the cone-hole combined mechanical seal and automatically adjust seal performance during operation, which is especially suitable for variable work conditions. In addition, the change of balance coefficient B and film thickness h caused by structure change of the tapered end face could made up defects of small dynamic pressure effect at low speed to achieve large opening force and could also work under large h so that the flatness and polish requirement for seal end face might be reduced. © All Right Reserved.","Face mechanical deformation; Hydrodynamics; Laminar flow; Numerical simulation","Computer simulation; Deformation; Dynamics; Hermetic seals; Hydrodynamics; Iterative methods; Laminar flow; Numerical methods; Pressure distribution; Pressure effects; Stresses; Balance coefficients; Face mechanical deformation; Fluid-solid coupling; High speed equipments; Sealing performance; Stress deformations; Structural parameter; Variable work conditions; Seals"

The mathematic model of LCL filter and the limiting conditions for all the parameters of filter were firstly studied. Then the impact of all the parameters of LCL filter on system was intuitively drawn on the same plane using curves by theoretical derivation.

The mathematic models of dynamic reliability were established considering the proportion of heavy vehicles. The dynamic reliability of a suspension bridge with 820 m mid-span under spare and heavy vehicles loads were discussed. The results show that the root-mean-square of displacement responses reaches the peak value in 1/4 span of the suspension girders under random traffic flow. The boundary cross rates of dynamic responses are stable with the increase of random vehicle sample number. In 100 years, the dynamic reliability index will drop to 5.11 from 5.92 under the actual operational state, which is caused by heavy and spare operation.

In the linearization and reduction of the rigid-flexible satellite mathematic model, usually one loses some important information associated with the satellite true dynamical behavior. One way to recovery this information is include to the ACS design parametric and not parametric uncertainties of the system. The H infinity control method is able to take into account the parametric uncertainty in the control law design, so the controller becomes more robust. This paper presents the design of a robust controller using the H infinity control technique to control the attitude of a rigid-flexible satellite. The satellite model is represented by a flexible beam connected to a central rigid hub considering a set of parametric uncertainties. The results of the simulations have shown that the control law designed with the H-infinity control method was robust enough as to support the action of uncertainty and control the rigid flexible satellite attitude and suppressing vibrations.

When TBM is advancing, there are plenty influence factors including geological conditions, operating status as well as TBM's structural features. Mechanics characteristics of the interaction between equipment and ground is analyzed. By calculating the limit stress state of rock elements in contact with the arc surface of cutter, a mathematic formula of the force acting on rock by cutterhead is presented, which is able to reflect influences of geological, operating, and structural parameters. Besides cutterhead, thrust components acting on shield and subsequent equipment are also taken into consideration. These three load components make up the total thrust force requirements for TBMs. Then two typical engineering cases in China are involved in model analysis and verification. Furthermore, the total thrust corresponding to unit penetration as an index for the discussion of TBM geological adaptability is introduced. By eliminating the influence of operating parameters, it is proper to analyze the intrinsic correlation between the thrust and geological parameters. It is indicated that uniaxial compressive rock strength(UCS) is the critical factor among various geological parameters. There is an approximately linear relationship between the UCS and the total thrust corresponding to unit penetration.

In particular, the laser welding leaves a feature at the edge of the weld bead called ""undercut"". In this work an experimental campaign has been conducted on Ti6Al4V butt joints. In particular a Central Composite Design (CCD) with the central point repeated three times has been investigated. In the CCD there are two factors (power and speed of the fiber laser) and five levels for each factor. This paper deals with the investigation about the correlation between the severity of the undercut and the process parameters of the laser welding. In particular, through the confocal microscopy, the original geometry of the joint was accurately acquired and rebuilt in order to make a FEM model and simulate the mechanical behavior using Ansys14.5. Moreover, response surfaces and level curves were carried out to understand and predict the depth and the width of the undercut starting from the power and the speed of the laser. At last a mathematic and geometry regression was performed in order to find a unique conical curve that interpolates all the different undercuts and that varies its parameters according to the process parameters.

The mathematic model was built and the performance under different ambient conditions was analyzed.

To reduce the heat loss, a novel heat recovery exchanger installed on the kiln shell is proposed to preheat water in this paper. Numerical simulations and experimental measurements are carried out to investigate the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the heat recovery exchanger. Then, multi-objective optimization models are proposed with the heat transfer area, the pressure drop and the modified entropy generation number set as objective functions. The mathematic models describe the relation between heat transfer rates and the design parameters of the heat recovery exchanger, i.e. the tube length, the tube numbers and the tube diameter. With the aid of the Matlab genetic algorithm toolbox, the optimized design parameters are obtained. Finally, economic analyses of a practical heat recovery system with nine heat recovery exchangers are proposed to estimate the saving of the fuel consumption. The optimization results show that the Pareto solutions are the trade-off between the two conflicting objective functions and give some final decisions considering specific requirements for the designers. Besides, the optimized results of heat transfer areas and pressure drop of the heat recovery exchanger are decreased by at least 18% and 11%, respectively. As the modified entropy generation number due to heat transfer and fluid friction decrease, the corresponding heat transfer area and pressure drop decrease, respectively. The economic analyses indicate that the heat recovery system is profitable and the revenue comes from the fuel savings. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy conservation; Genetic algorithm; Heat recovery exchanger; Multi-objective optimization; Rotary kiln","Brickmaking; Design; Drops; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Entropy; Fuel economy; Genetic algorithms; Heat losses; Heat transfer; MATLAB; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Pressure drop; Rotary kilns; Specific heat; Waste heat; Conflicting objectives; Entropy generation numbers; Flow and heat transfer; Heat recovery systems; Heat transfer area; Multi-objective optimization models; Objective functions; Optimization design; Heat exchangers; design method; economic analysis; energy conservation; entropy; equipment; genetic algorithm; heat transfer; numerical model; optimization; pressure drop"

Firstly, the motion mathematical model of the cutting mechanism was established. Then, by using the virtual prototype of ADAMS, the parametric model of movement characteristics of cutting mechanism was completed according to these mathematic equations. And the influence of the main parameters of the mechanism on the movement of the mechanism were analyzed, including the link length of l1, l2, l3 and rise rotation angle β of the cam. Meanwhile, depending on the analysis method of sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm, the optimal aggregative index could be obtained under the condition that l1 was 247 mm, l2 was 154 mm, and l4 was 139.5 mm. In this situation, the kinematic simulation analysis showed that the maximum value of acceleration of the lower cutter was 7971 mm/s2 and the cutting distance was 20.4 mm. Finally, based on the above simulation and analysis, the prototype was processed with the optimized parameters.

A collaborative action research (CAR) professional development programme (PDP) was established to help prospective teachers resolve many of the dilemmas and improve their classroom practices in a 10-week practicum course. It was found that CAR has a powerful impact upon teacher candidates as it solves many of the dilemmas and concerns. Belief changes of one trainee teacher are presented as an exemplary case. While such findings can improve our understandings of pre-service teachers' cognitive learning and problem solving skills at the practicum site, they also generate useful insights into designing a PDP to promote trainee teachers' school-based professional development in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematic) education. © 2017 by IGI Global.

In a previous study, we showed that the fitted single-exponential time constants of the postsaccadic drifts are longer in the temporal-to-nasal (T->N) direction than in the nasal-to-temporal (N->T) direction. In the present study, we further report that saccadic peak velocities are higher and saccadic amplitudes are larger in the N->T direction than in the T->N direction. We investigated the underlying mechanism of this ocular disconjugacy in the dark with a top-down approach. A mathematic ocular motor model, including an eye plant, a set of burst neurons and a velocity-to-position neural integrator (VPNI), was built to simulate the typical larval eye movements in the dark. The modeling parameters, such as VPNI time constants, neural impulse signals generated by the burst neurons and time constants of the eye plant, were iteratively adjusted to fit the average saccadic eye movement. These simulations suggest that four pools of burst neurons and four pools of VPNIs are needed to explain the disconjugate eye movements in our results. A premotor mechanism controls the synchronous timing of binocular saccades, but the pools of burst and integrator neurons in zebrafish larvae seem to be different (and maybe separate) for both eyes and horizontal directions, which leads to the observed ocular disconjugacies during saccades and postsaccadic drifts in the dark. © 2016 Chen, Bockisch, Straumann and Huang.","Brainstem; Gaze holding; Larvae; Ocular motor; Saccades; Zebrafish",

The objective of the research comprised of establishing the most beneficial spatial position of pendulums to minimize the necessary time to repair the rotor unbalance. The mathematical research of the motion of a rotor with pendulum SBDs in the situation of their misalignment was undertaken. This objective was achieved by using the Lagrange equations of the second type. The analysis identified limiting cases of location of the rotor unbalance vector and the vector of housing's unbalance relative to each other, as well as the minimum capacity of the pendulum.

Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is thought to play an important role in the integration and synchronization of bone remodeling. To further understand the mechanism of bone development it is important to quantify the difference in the GJIC capacity of young and developmentally mature osteocytes. Materials and methods We first established an embryonic chick calvaria growth model to show the growth of the calvaria in embryos at 13 to 21 days of age. We then applied a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) technique to compare the difference in the GJIC capacity of young osteocytes with that of developmentally mature osteocytes. Finally, we quantified the dye (Calcein) diffusion from the FRAP data using a mathematic model of simple diffusion which was also used to identify simple diffusion GJIC pattern cells (fitted model) and accelerated diffusion GJIC pattern cells (non-fitted model). Results The relationship between the longest medial-lateral length of the calvaria (frontal bone) and the embryonic age fit a logarithmic growth model: length = 5.144 × ln(day) − 11.340. The morphometric data during osteocyte differentiation showed that the cellular body becomes more spindle-shaped and that the cell body volume decreased by approximately 22% with an increase in the length of the processes between the cells. However, there were no significant differences in the cellular body surface area or in the distance between the mass centres of the cells. The dye-displacement rate in young osteocytes was significantly higher than that in developmentally mature osteocytes: dye displacement only occurred in 26.88% of the developmentally mature osteocytes, while it occurred in 64.38% of the young osteocytes. Additionally, in all recovered osteocytes, 36% of the developmentally mature osteocytes comprised non-fitted model cells while 53.19% of the young osteocytes were the non-fitted model, which indicates the active transduction of dye molecules. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the young and developmentally mature osteocytes with regard to the diffusion coefficient, permeability coefficient, or permeance of the osteocyte processes, which were 3.93 ± 3.77 (× 10− 8 cm2/s), 5.12 ± 4.56 (× 10− 5 cm2/s) and 2.99 ± 2.47 (× 10− 13 cm2/s) (mean ± SD), respectively.

In a prospective test group of 22 patients at the same hospital, this model outperformed logistic regression models in vasospasm prediction on the basis of the same datasets. One of the model's limitations was a question of reproducibility in other centers. In this report, the author describes his experience with the prospective use of the model at a different hospital with a different population setting. Methods Patient data of 25 consecutive cases of aneurysm rupture were prospectively assessed by the model to predict SCV. The prediction was then compared with actual outcome. For the purpose of this report, SCV is defined as a delayed focal decline in neurological examination correlated with an area of radiographic vasospasm. This serves as the primary end point of the predictive model. Each case prediction is reported, along with strength of prediction, which is built into the model. The model's positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and sensitivity and specificity are reported. Results Thirty patients are included in the analysis. Seven patients (23%) were diagnosed with SCV. The model predicted 10 patients would have SCV (positive predictive value 70%). The model predicted 20 patients would not have SCV (negative predictive value 100%). The sensitivity of the model was 100%, and the specificity of the model was 87%.

Water, ethanol, 2-propanol and acetic acid have been investigated as solvents in the range temperatures from a 298.15 to 348.15 K. Owing to the absence of cis,cis-muconic acid solubility data, the reliability of the adopted experimental set-up was validated comparing published and experimental solubility data of a similar compound, that is, adipic acid. From the results, it has emerged that the employed system is appropriate for the determination of molar fractions of an organic compound dissolved in polar solvents. The molar fraction and temperature were correlated using the Apelblat equation model, which is applied for the mathematic fitting of experimental data. A total relative average deviation of 3.54% was obtained for the experimental results and the solubility data obtained with the model, thus attesting the adequacy for this study.

The former one is related to the characteristic curve of pumps:the larger the pumping head is,the less influence of blade angle will be. The latter one is subjected to the capacity and demand:the higher the capacity is, the more apparently load transfers. When the demand is lower, blade angle is the major factor.

Two field trials were carried out for establishing absorbed-N effects on dry matter production (ANEDr) model, using uniform design in 2010–2011 and 2012–2013 winter wheat growing seasons in Hebei Province, China. Another field trial was carried out in 2010–2011 for model validation. Dry matter and N concentration in leaf and non-leaf organs were measured at setting, jointing, anthesis, and maturity. Theory of best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) was applied to analyse the N effects of leaf and non-leaf organs on dry matter production. Within ANEDr model, four N-affected phases at each stage were concerned, leaf absorbed-N effect before this stage, non-leaf organ absorbed-N effect before this stage, leaf absorbed-N effect at this stage, and non-leaf organ absorbed-N effect at this stage. In addition, developmental processes, genotype characters and temperature were three factors that determine each N effect. It was demonstrated that ANEDr model can precisely quantify absorbed-N effects on dry matter production with high correlation coefficient (r=0.95). Comparing with other models, ANEDr model considered both leaf and non-leaf organs according to developmental processes of winter wheat, showed higher flexibility and simplicity, thus could be applied to different environments, cultivars and crops after parameter adjustment. © 2016 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences","BLUP; dry matter production; effects of absorbed-N; winter wheat",

Children suffering from mathematic disorders have deficits especially in fundamental arithmetical skills such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Thus, the acquisition of arithmetical skills is based on specific abilities, such as knowledge of numbers, and basal non-specific abilities, like visual-perceptual and memory-related processes. Diagnosing a ""visual perceptual disorder"" is complicated because there are no ICD-10 criteria. The consortium of the scientific medical professional societies (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften) describe alternative diagnostic criteria that are similar to the diagnostic criteria of other developmental disorders. These criteria state that (1) the results in the DTVP-A are at least 1.5 SD below average and (2) the results in the DTVP-A are at least 1.5 SD below general-IQ. This study aims to investigate the visual perceptual and further cognitive abilities of primary school children with arithmetic disabilities. Therefore, the indices of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV) and the visual perceptual achievement in the German version of the Developmental Test of Visual Perception-Adolescent and Adult (DTVP-A) of 39 children with dyscalculia and 30 controls were analyzed. For further comparisons the group of children suffering from dyscalculia is divided into children achieving average results on the general IQ and children achieving below average results. The visual-perceptual abilities of all three groups differ significantly. The pairwise comparisons show that children with dyscalculia and average IQ score significantly below the control groups on DTVP-A and the Perceptual Organization Index of WISC-IV. The pairwise comparisons also show that children suffering from dyscalculia and which have a general IQ below average, achieve significantly lower scores on DTVP-A and all indices of WISC-IV than the control group and the group of children with dyscalculia and average IQ. In total, 39%of the children with dyscalculia show clinically relevant performance in the DTVP-A. When the results of the two dyscalculia-groups are analyzed separately, 17% of the group of children with average IQ and 73% of the children with a general IQ below average show clinically relevant performance in the DTVP-A. Using diagnostic criteria of the consortium of the scientific medical professional, only one child suffering from dyscalculia receives a ""visual perceptual disorder"" diagnosis. This child achieves an average general IQ. For 13% of both dyscalculia-groups a ""visual perceptual disorder"" is diagnosed if the Verbal Comprehension Index is used instead of the general IQ. The results of the regression analysis indicate that the visual perceptional and the working memory abilities explain 35.3 to 52.8% of the arithmetic abilities. Visual-perceptual deficits of children suffering from dyscalculia are underestimated, especially for children with a general IQ below average. Thus, visual perceptual abilities should always be tested within diagnosing dyscalculia. Furthermore, reliable diagnostic criteria of a ""visual perceptual disorder"" are needed. © 2016 Hogrefe Verlag.","Comparative study; DTVP-A; Dyscalculia; Visual perception; WISC-IV",

According to international organization for standardization 2631-1:1997, the lateral vibration can be more hazardous to operators' work performance, comfort and health than the vertical vibration when the vibration frequency is below 3 Hz, and meanwhile, some vibration systems of off-road vehicles can resonate in this frequency range. But seldom research was conducted on the lateral vibration characteristics of off-road vehicles. In this paper, a new theoretical vibration model including the lateral and roll directions of ride vibration in space was constructed for the unsuspended tractor with 2 degrees of freedom, and the theoretical formula was presented for calculating the lateral natural frequency of domestic tractors. In this lateral vibration model, the radical and lateral stiffness of tires was taken into account. By the use of a CF700 tractor without suspensions from Changfa Group in Jiangsu Province, the accuracy of the theoretical values of the lateral vibration model was improved according to the measured radial stiffness of the tire on the test rig, which was independently developed in light of free vibration logarithmic decrement method for measuring the radial stiffness and damping of tractor tires. And the lateral stiffness of tires was calculated by the mathematic formulas. Subsequently, the rolling moment of inertia of the CF700 tractor's body was obtained on another test rig, which was independently developed based on simple pendulum with edge and spring method for measuring the moments of inertia of both pitch and roll. The experiments were repeated 3 times. Then, the theoretical and experimental methods were combined to calculate the theoretical values of the lateral natural frequency of the CF700 tractor. Driving experiments were conducted on an ISO-5008 standard track to investigate the lateral vibration characteristics and to verify the validity of the theoretical values of the lateral natural frequency for the CF700 tractor. The lateral vibrations of the CF700 tractor were measured approximately at 5 forward speeds of 5, 9, 11, 13 and 15 km/h. The measurement was repeated 5 times for each speed. The experimental values were obtained mainly with the LMS test system and the on-board strain-gage-based transducers and triaxial accelerometers. The discrete time series of the measured data were resolved and reconstructed by wavelet and Fourier analysis. The results showed that the experimental values of the lateral natural frequency of the CF700 tractor were 1.975, 1.953, 1.904, 1.902 and 1.901 Hz respectively at 5 forward speeds. And the peak values of lateral vibration acceleration power spectral density were respectively 0.52, 2.84, 3.43, 4.08 and 4.95 (m·s2)2/Hz. And the theoretical calculated values of the lateral natural frequency of the CF700 tractor were respectively 1.9603, 1.9314, 1.8996, 1.8996 and 1.8996 Hz. Compared with the measured lateral natural frequency, the maximum relative error was 1.11% for the theoretical calculated value. Therefore, it verified the accuracy of the theoretical formula of the lateral natural frequency. And it further indicated that the lateral natural frequency decreased to a constant with the increase of the travelling speed of the CF700 tractor. Also, it showed that higher travelling speed produced higher peak level of lateral vibration acceleration power spectral density, which made drivers feel the more lateral vibration intensity of off-road vehicles. Therefore, the lateral vibration of off-road vehicles needs to be isolated. The work provides an important reference for the design of the lateral vibration reduction system of seat suspension of agricultural tractors or other off-road vehicles. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

One of the most popular concerns about HEVs is the realization of real-time control. Researchers have come up with multiple architectures about the optimization of the energy management control of HEVs, and the most commonly used algorithms are dynamic programming (DP), equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), Pontryagin's minimum strategy (PMP), as well as some algorithms developed from them. In order to achieve the optimal solutions with DP, a given route or velocity profile is required, which is yet normally impossible. Therefore, some researchers come up with the method of model predictive control (MPC) to obtain the predicted driving cycle, so that the need of prior-knowledge can be met. As the combination of DP and ECMS is time-consuming, some researchers finally find ECMS and PMP can be alternatives to achieve global optimal solutions or approximate to them. However, these methods mentioned above cannot realize real-time control, even though many efforts have been done to develop more time-efficient algorithms, and the controlled objects were simplified in different degrees and some details were ignored, such as driver's intention, road conditions, signal lights and mutual effects among vehicles under real driving environment. With the development of intelligent traffic system (ITS), the real-time control based on vehicle connection becomes possible. In the connected vehicle environment, vehicles can communicate with each other and with traffic infrastructure, and they can also share their position and velocity information within the vehicle group with the help of the technologies of dedicated short range communication (DSRC), radio frequency identification devices (RFID), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and cellular network. This paper focused on the hierarchical control of a group of 4 connected vehicles. The upper level controller integrated signal phase and timing (SPAT), multi-island genetic algorithm and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), which dealt with the generation of the primary velocity profiles, the best locations and target velocities, and the optimal target velocity sequences respectively. The lower level controller dealt with the energy management of HEV with adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS), and obtained the optimal power splits of the engine and motor at a given time. One thing that should be addressed was that the higher level controller and lower level controller were both virtual controllers embedded in the distant server, which communicated with the driver and vehicle parts by wireless communications. Because of the super calculation ability of the server or cloud computing, the real-time control of HEVs could be achieved. In the upper level controller, the mathematic description of the problem was presented, which consisted of the vehicle longitude dynamics equation, the power request equation and the cost minimization function, and was a weighted sum of the fuel consumption, the velocity deviations between the vehicle and the one at its immediate back, the control variables of traction or braking force per unit mass, and the relative distance between the 2 vehicles. The aim of the higher level controller was to get the optimal velocity profile as well as the avoidance of red light stopping. Another method based on Gipp's car following model was also presented as a baseline method. With the best positions and target velocity sequences obtained from the optimal control problem, the optimal target velocity was calculated using NMPC over a given time horizon. The hierarchical control strategy was validated using hardware-in-the-loop and Clemson Palmetto server. The simulation results showed that the control method proposed in this paper could realize the energy management of the HEVs, avoid red light stopping, and achieve good velocity tracking as well as reduce fuel consumptions. Compared with the baseline method, the average fuel economy improvements for the A-ECMS, ECMS and rule-based controllers were 27.2%, 28.2%, and 29.5%, respectively. When the higher level controller was based on V2X (vehicle to vehicle, and vehicle to infrastructure), compared with ECMS and rule-based controllers, the average fuel economy improvements for A-ECMS-based controller were 10.3% and 14.8%, respectively. Above all, the research method could be a new architecture to the energy management of HEVs. With the help of the architecture and some developed algorithms, the realization of the real-time control for HEVs will be likely possible. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

However, the mathematic model established by ANCF is always converted to differential algebraic equation (DAE) based on analytical mechanics methods, which leads to an O(n2) or O(n3) algorithm complexity and position or speed constraint violation during the solution procedure. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a recursive absolute nodal coordinate formulation (RANCF) with O(n) algorithm complexity. Firstly, the flexible bodies are described by RANCF. Secondly, a kinematic and dynamic recursive relationship between adjacent elements in the flexible multibody system is established based on the articulated body algorithm (ABA). The equation obtained by RANCF is an ordinary differential equation (ODE), and the system generalized mass matrix is a tridiagonal block matrix. Thus, a recursive solution of the equation by element could be obtained through an appropriate matrix processing. On this basis, a particular algorithm flow of RANCF is provided with the efficiency of each step analyzed in detail, which proves the RANCF is an O(n) complexity algorithm. The RANCF maintains the advantage of ANCF that can accurately solve large deformation multibody problem, and vastly improves the computational efficiency of ANCF. In addition, because the ANCF avoids the constraint violation problems of DAE, it also has a higher algorithm accuracy. Finally, the validity and efficiently of this method is verified by the MSC.

To stop a high speed projectile experiencing over great acceleration inside a barrel within a limited distance and without damage, the soft recovery method was studied with theoretical analysis and tests. By compressing air ahead a projectile in an identical caliber recovery tube with a single stage diaphragm rupture, the projectile's kinetic energy was absorbed and released. The compressed air chamber was described with an one-dimension constant cross-section unsteady inviscid flow equation. And combined with the projectile dynamic equation, the mathematic model of the soft recovery system was set up. The second order MacComark scheme with an artificial viscous term and the four order Runge-Kutta method were applied to solve equations numerically. The matching relationship among projectile's initial velocity, chamber initial pressure and diaphragm rupture pressure was analyzed.

The change can greatly affect the measurement of astronomical spectroscopy, deteriorate the precision of spectrograph, and make the astronomical spectrum too complicated to analyze because of pseudo drifts and structures in spectrum. The propagation characteristics of step-index cylindrical multimode fiber are analyzed by ray optics, and thus the two major factors causing the formation of the ring output field are revealed. One is the coupling deviation, including center deviation and angle deviation. The other is the trace of the ray due to the rotation invariance of cylindrical fiber.

Unfortunately, the process of the time stretch is not linear due to the nonlinear modulation of the electro-optic intensity modulator in the PTS system, which means the undesired harmonics distortion.

It is shown how integrated variables up to three degrees with deterministic trend parts can be transformed into positive and negative cumulative partial components. These cumulative components can be used for implementing the asymmetric causality tests based on a Wald test statistic that is shown to follow a chi-square distribution asymptotically. Each solution is expressed as a proposition and a mathematic proof is provided for each underlying proposition. This issue is important because most economic or financial variables seem to be characterized by both stochastic as well as deterministic trend parts. An empirical application is provided in order to show how the oil prices and the exchange rates as integrated variables with drift and trend can be transformed into cumulative partial sums of positive and negative components.

Through deriving the twist equation of two-level and two-loop spatial mechanisms with coupling chains, the mathematic model of coupling relations caused by coupling chains is established. Based on the twist equation, the method for rigid substructure detection and the principle of mobility analysis of the class of mechanisms are proposed.

We build a mathematic model for the HNP method and formulate it to be a constraint optimization problem.

It is one of most commonly used and most effective methods for the separation and analysis of precious metals due to strong representativeness, high accuracy and good stability. However, the lead fire assaying gravimetry also has some disadvantages such as long analytical procedure and systemic lower analytical results (especially for silver). If the second or secondary assaying is used (e.g., national and industrial standard), the analytical procedure will be longer and the operation cost will be higher. The fundamental principles in lead fire assaying analysis (such as slagging enrichment and lead-removal refining) were explored and analyzed. When the smelting and cupellation conditions were well controlled, the mathematic model for correction of silver loss amount in smelting and cupellation process was theoretically established according to the silver content in composite granule and the mass of lead button in first assaying. Thus, a determination method of silver was proposed by lead fire assay gravimetry combined with mathematic correction, which completely avoiding second assaying. The content of silver in three representative samples (including crude copper, copper concentrate and copper anode slime) was determined by the experimental method and lead fire assaying-recovery correction method. In the latter method, the lost silver in residue and cupel was determined by second fire assaying to obtain the corrected ralue of silver. The results showed that the relative difference between two methods were within ±0.5%. The relative standard deviation(RSD, n=11) with proposed method was 0.9%. In addition, the optimal lead button mass with various samples and assay ingredient schemes was obtained by higher mathematics derivation, and the lead button mass in related analysis standards was reasonably and scientifically reviewed. © 2016, CISRI Boyuan Publishing Co., Ltd.

It is difficult to predict the finial pattern of the pile surface in the process of the design of patterned fabric. There are few researches on computer simulation of the fabric because of their complicated and fuzzy characteristic. This paper focuses on computer simulation of this group of pile fabrics. Firstly, the characteristics of warp-knitted brushed fabric and the factors that influence the pile are discussed. Secondly, a simplified line model is proposed to represent the shape of the pile by some lines in a certain titling angle, radial angle and length. A two-dimensional matrix is used to describe the position and color of piles in one pattern repeat. Finally, based on the mathematic model, a program is developed by VC++.NET to realize the simulation of the brushed fabric with a patterned pile. By the input of some parameters that were adjusted according to the craft, the two-dimensional computer simulation of the pile surface was found to be similar to the actual patterned pile fabric.

Using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), the effect of three pretreatment parameters, including acid concentration, treatment time, and reaction temperature, on pretreatment efficiency were evaluated and used to generate mathematic optimization model. The hydrolysis results indicated that oxalic acid pretreatment led to the highest enhancement of enzymatic saccharification up to 213.4 mg (starting from 500 mg of pretreated sample) when using 5.01% oxalic acid concentration at 135.91 °C for 30.86 min, which was 2.68 times higher than the untreated rice straw. The structural changes in the pretreated biomass were investigated using FT-IR analysis. The results suggested that lignin composition was significantly removed from the pretreated biomass, and the crystalline cellulose was also modified to amorphous form during pretreatment.

We also describe the challenges facing the clinical implementation of texture analysis. CONCLUSION. Texture analysis of lung cancer images has been applied successfully to FDG PET and CT scans. Different texture parameters have been shown to be predictive of the nature of disease and of patient outcome. In general, it appears that more heterogeneous tumors on imaging tend to be more aggressive and to be associated with poorer outcomes and that tumor heterogeneity on imaging decreases with treatment.

End to end QoE of video services in HWN is determined by not only the network but also the video characteristics. In this paper, a metric termed as QoE coverage is proposed to evaluate the coverage performance of HWNs for video services. First, subjective quality test is performed to improve the existing video quality prediction model, and the expression of QoE coverage is derived by combining video and network parameters. Second, two QoE provisioning schemes, i.e., homogeneous and heterogeneous quality thresholds of HWN are analyzed to show the mathematic properties. Third, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed to show its differences to SINR coverage. Compared with state-of-the-art SINR coverage, QoE coverage takes both physical layer and application layer parameters into consideration and provides more realistic user satisfactory.

At present, the most commonly used estimation method is empirical formula calculation, which, however, cannot explain the phenomenon that the steering torque increases rapidly when steering angle becomes very large (over 300°). This article proposes an estimation method of static steering torque on the basis of a mathematic model of tire-patch sliding torque, taking into account the changeable torque transmission ratio from steered wheel to steering wheel. Three components of static steering torque are modeled and analyzed, including the tire-patch sliding torque, gravity aligning torque, and internal friction torque of the steering system. In order to investigate the static steering torque at steering wheel, the transmission ratio of steering torque is obtained on the basis of rack-suspension mathematical analysis. An example of static steering torque estimation is conducted with the proposed method and is compared with experimental results. The comparison shows that the estimation results given by the proposed method are in better accordance with experimental results than other approaches. © The Author(s) 2016.","rack-suspension mathematical model; Static steering torque; steering portability; tire-road contact patch sliding model; transmission ratio",

A new hardening rule is developed based on a new interpolation function of the hardening modulus that has simple mathematic expression and fewer model parameters. The evolution of hardening modulus field is described in the deviatoric stress space. It is assumed that the stress reverse points are the mapping centre points and the mapping centre moves with the variation of loading and unloading paths to describe the cyclic stress-strain hysteresis curve. In addition, by introducing a model parameter that reflects the accumulation rate and level of shear strain to the interpolation function, the cyclic shakedown and failure behaviour of soil elements with different combinations of initial and cyclic stresses can be captured. The methods to determine the model parameters using cyclic triaxial compression tests are also studied. Finally, the cyclic triaxial extension and torsional shear tests are performed.

In CT, Haar-like features are efficiently extracted with a very sparse measurement matrix and modeled as an online updated naïve Bayes classifier to account for target appearance change. The naïve Bayes classifier ignores overlap between Haar-like features and assumes that Haar-like features are independently distributed, which leads to drift in complex scenario. To address this problem, we present an extended CT algorithm, which assumes that all Haar-like features are correlated with each other and have multivariate Gaussian distribution. The mean vector and covariance matrix of multivariate normal distribution are incrementally updated with constant computational complexity to adapt to target appearance change. Each frame is associated with a temporal weight to expend less modeling power on old observation. Based on temporal weight, an update scheme with changing but convergent learning rate is derived with strict mathematic proof. Compared with CT, our extended algorithm achieves a richer representation of target appearance. The incremental multivariate Gaussian distribution is integrated into the particle filter framework to achieve better tracking performance. Extensive experiments on the CVPR2013 tracking benchmark demonstrate that our proposed tracker achieves superior performance both qualitatively and quantitatively over several state-of-the-art trackers. © 2016 SPIE and IS and T.","compressive tracking; incremental learning; multivariate normal distribution","Benchmarking; Covariance matrix; Normal distribution; Bayes Classifier; Haar-like features; Incremental learning; Measurement matrix; Multi-variate normal distributions; Multivariate Gaussian Distributions; State of the art; Tracking performance; Gaussian distribution"

It is important for healthcare students to overcome this barrier when calculating drug dosages in order to avoid administering the incorrect dose to a patient when in the clinical setting. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of maths anxiety on healthcare students' ability to accurately calculate drug dosages by performing a scoping review of the existing literature. This review utilised a six-stage methodology using the following databases; CINAHL, Embase, Medline, Scopus, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Trip database (http://www.tripdatabase.com/) and Grey Literature report (http://www.greylit.org/). After an initial title/abstract review of relevant papers, and then full text review of the remaining papers, six articles were selected for inclusion in this study. Of the six articles included, there were three experimental studies, two quantitative studies and one mixed method study. All studies addressed nursing students and the presence of maths anxiety. No relevant studies from other disciplines were identified in the existing literature. Three studies took place in the U.S, the remainder in Canada, Australia and United Kingdom. Upon analysis of these studies, four factors including maths anxiety were identified as having an influence on a student's drug dosage calculation abilities. Ultimately, the results from this review suggest more research is required in nursing and other relevant healthcare disciplines regarding the effects of maths anxiety on drug dosage calculations.

The HR variability during the recovery phase is closely related to the degree of intensity and duration of the load during exercise training. Approach: The aim of this study was to propose a mathematic dynamic model that is capable of en bloc analysis of the load effect on the heart rate (HR) recovery time profile. The model is based on a linear differential equation of the exhaustive exercise and 15minute recovery phases of the cycle ergometer test. Purpose: In total, 14 young, healthy footballers, 20 other sportsmen and 9 sportswomen participated in the test. The starting load was 50W with increasing increments of 20W every minute until maximal exhaustion was reached. The model calculated a new HRR0 parameter for the period immediately after the end of the exercise phase and the HRR1 recovery during the first minute after the end of the exercise, according to the model parameters. Results: The recovery load model parameters was significantly statistically lower for the sportswomen compared with the other sportsmen (p=0.008). When the load was increased by 1Wat a steady state, the HR was 27.27% higher for the sportswomen compared with the footballers and other sportsmen. Conclusion: The study proposes a modification of the standard HR evaluation test using a new approach that is capable of estimating the HR recovery from model parameters without using HR measurements during the initial minute after exhaustive exercise. The load and recovery phase were analyzed en bloc using a simple mathematical dynamic model with a minimum number of parameters, as expressed by a linear differential equation of the HR time profile measurements. © JPES.","Cardiovascular response; Dynamic modeling; Exercise; Maximal exhaustion",

However, the mathematic size quantification of micro-uptake is not yet available. We designed and performed this phantom-based study to set up an in-vitro model of the mathematical calculation of micro-uptake by the pixelized measurement. Methods: The micro 99mTc-HDP deposits used in this study were spontaneously formed both in a large standard flood and small house-made dish phantoms. The processing was as follows: first, phantoms were flooded with distilled water and 99mTc-HDP was therein injected to induce micro 99mTc-HDP deposition; second, the deposits were scanned using parallel-hole and pinhole collimator to generally survey 99mTc-HDP deposition pattern; and third, the scans underwent gamma correction (GC) to discern individual deposits for size measurement. Results: In original naïve scans, tracer distribution was simply nebulous in appearance and, hence, could not be measured. Impressively, however, GCPS could discern individual micro deposits so that they were calculated by pixelized measurement. Phantoms naturally formed micro 99mTc-HDP deposits that are analogous to 99mTc-HDP uptake on in-vivo bone scan. The smallest one we measured was 0.414 mm. Flooded phantoms and therein injected 99mTc-HDP form nebulous micro 99mTc-HDP deposits that are rendered discernible by GCPB and precisely calculable using pixelized measurement.

According to the survey data in Oil &amp; Gas Journal, thermal methods are the most widely utilized in EOR projects in heavy oil fields in the US and Canada, and there are not many successful chemical flooding projects for heavy oil reported elsewhere in the world. However, thermal methods such as steam injection might be restricted in cases of thin formations, overlying permafrost, or reservoir depths over 4500 ft, for which chemical flooding becomes a better option for recovering crude oil. Moreover, owing to the considerable fluctuations in the oil price, chemical injection plans should be employed consistently in terms of either technical or economic viewpoints. The numerical studies in this work aim to clarify the predominant chemical injection schemes among the various combinations of chemical agents involving alkali (A), surfactant (S) and polymer (P) for specific heavy-oil reservoir conditions. The feasibilities of all potential injection sequences are evaluated in the pre- evaluation stage in order to select the most efficient injection scheme according to the variation in the oil price which is based on practical market values. Finally, optimization procedures in the post-evaluation stage are carried out for the most economic injection plan by an effective mathematic tool with the purpose of gaining highest Net Present Value (NPV) of the project. In technical terms, the numerical studies confirm the predominant performances of sequences in which alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP) solution is injected after the first preflushing water whereby the recovery factor can be higher than 47%. In particular, the oil production performances are improved by injecting a buffering viscous fluid right after the first chemical slug rather than using a water slug in between. The results of the pre-evaluation show that two sequences of the ASP group have the highest NPV corresponding to the dissimilar applied oil prices. In the post- evaluation, the successful use of response surface methodology (RSM) in the estimation and optimization procedures with coefficients of determination R2 greater than 0.97 shows that the project can possibly gain 4.47 $MM at a mean oil price of 46.5 $/bbl with the field scale of a quarter five-spot pattern. Further, with the novel assumption of normal distribution for the oil price variation, the chemical flooding sequence of concurrent alkali-surfactant-polymer injection with a buffering polymer solution is evaluated as the most feasible scheme owing to the achievement of the highest NPV at the highly possible oil price of 40-55 $/bbl compared to the other scheme. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.","Alkaline-surfactant-polymer flooding; Chemical flooding; EOR; Heavy oil; Optimization; Response surface methodology",

The thrust, mass flow, shaft power, efficiency of the pump and propulsive efficiency with different rotation directions of the studied waterjet were compared. The rotation direction of the rotor had an effect on the mass flow and thrust, while it had little effect on the efficiency of the pump and propulsive efficiency. The DES turbulence model was adopted in transient calculation to compare pressure fluctuation. The maximum pressure fluctuation amplitude of the inward rotor was smaller than the outward rotor. The noise calculation based on the transient calculation shows that the noise of the inward rotor was also smaller than that of the outward rotor.

However, there still exist several problems. On one hand, practical superheat control with PID method usually leads to unstable output. On the other hand, the steady model is not suitable for variable load analysis. Moreover, the high-order, coupling and non-linear dynamic model of the refrigeration system makes it difficult to analysis and control. In order to better cope with these problems, in this paper, a model-free control strategy is proposed for the dual-input dual-output energy-saving control design of the refrigeration system. This proposed model-free control method doesn't need the mathematic model of the system under control and it is suitable for complex nonlinear systems.

Consequently, in this paper, on basis of a damper thought a delayed differential feedback method is proposed to stabilize the Buck converter from the chaotic state to the various periodic orbits via adjusting the feedback coefficient and the time delayed value. First, based on the mathematic model of the uncontrolled Buck converter, nonlinear behaviors are investigated by analyzing the bifurcation diagram, the switching logic diagram and the power spectrum of the chaotic state. Subsequently, according to the mathematical model of the controlled Buck converter, feasibility of the proposed method is confirmed through analyzing the controllable range charts with different time delayed values, the inductor current waveforms, the output voltage waveforms, the switching logic diagrams, the power spectrums, the phase portraits and the comparison graph respectively. Results show that requiring no knowledge of the targeted orbits in advance, the proposed method stabilizes the chaotic state of the Buck converter to the period-1, 2 and 4 orbits by selecting a feedback coefficient as well as a time delayed value appropriately. As the time delayed value decreases, the period-1 operation point occurs with a smaller feedback coefficient. Besides, this method is independent of internal circuit parameters of the Buck converter. The results of this paper have important implications in suppressing chaos in many power electronic circuits like the power factor correction circuit. © 2016 TCCT.","delayed differential feedback; feedback coefficient; suppressing chaos; time delay",

Methods: Twelve individuals with known PMI (range from 4.3 to 22.5 h) were selected and total RNA was extracted from brain tissue. Eight commonly used RNA markers were chosen including β-actin, GAPDH, RPS29, 18S rRNA, 5S rRNA, U6 snRNA, miRNA-9 and miRNA-125b, and the expression levels were detected in brain tissue by realtime fluorescent quantitative PCR. The internal reference markers with stable expression in early PMI were screened using geNorm software and the relationship between its expression level and some relevant factors such as age, gender and cause of death were analyzed. RNA markers normalized by internal reference were inserted into the mathematic model established by previous research for PMI estimation using R software. Model quality was judged by the error rate calculated with estimated PMI. Results: 5S rRNA, miRNA-9 and miRNA-125b showed quite stable expression and their expression levels had no relation with age, gender and cause of death. The error rate of estimated PMI using β-actin was 24.6%, while GAPDH was 41.0%. Conclusion: 5S rRNA, miRNA-9 and miRNA-125b are suitable as internal reference markers of human brain tissue owing to their stable expression in early PMI. The expression level of β-actin correlates well with PMI, which can be used as an additional index for early PMI estimation. © 2016 by the Editorial Department of Journal of Forensic Medicine.","Brain; Forensic pathology; Postmortem interval; Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR; RNA",

On the basis of field investigation, the methods of mathematic model and 3S technology were adopted. The plantation biomass was classified as total biomass (TB), existent biomass (EB), and lost biomass (LB), which represents the biomasses of all trees, living trees and dead trees, respectively. The ratio of existent biomass to lost biomass (EB/LB) was used to describe the relationship between different components of biomass and to reflect the plantation health condition from a new perspective. Then, the spatial distribution patterns and the impacting factors of plantation biomass were discussed. The results revealed that TB of plantation on Beichangshan Island summed to 58.8 kt, with the average value of 145.8t/hm2, which was higher than that of the whole country and Shandong Province. EB summed to 37.9 kt with the average value of 93.9t/hm2, and LB summed to 20.9 kt with the average value of 51.9t/hm2, indicating that the health condition of plantation has been an important factor impacting the plantation biomass. With the increase in stand density, both TB and EB firstly increased and then decreased, while LB kept an increasing trend, whereas EB/LB showed the opposite trend. The diameter at breast height (DBH) of 10~20cm accounted for the most biomass, and with the increase in DBH, EB/LB of Pinus thunbergii tended to decrease, while EB/LB of Robinia pseudoacacia showed the opposite trend. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was significantly positively correlated with TB, EB and EB/LB, but negatively correlated with LB. EB/LB was significantly positively correlated with slope aspect, soil moisture content, total phosphorus and total nitrogen but negatively correlated with altitude, slope, soil salinity and total potassium, and had no significant correlations with slope position, soil pH and total carbon. © 2016, Editorial Board of China Environmental Science.

In the experiment part, the cascade heat pump consists of the low-temperature refrigeration cycle using R22 and the high-temperature heat pump cycle using R134a. The transient effect is presented by circulating water to receive the rejection heat from the condensing refrigerant of the cascade heat pump causing the rise of the hot water temperature. On the other hand, a mathematic model of the condensation heat consisting of the heat transfer models in the two-phase mixture and the superheated vapor regions is developed. The effect of the hot water flow rate on the hot water temperature and the condensation heat is examined. The result indicates that the hot water temperature continuously increases with time. The condensation heat rapidly increases at the beginning and gradually increases with time. The agreement between the results obtained from the experiment and the model prediction is obtained. The result from the model prediction indicates that the heat transfer on the R134a side dominates the total heat transfer mechanism. The experimental result shows that the COP of the heat pump increases with increasing hot water flow rate, leading to the higher efficiency of the heat pump. © 2016, Chulalongkorn University 1.

It is a complex mixture composed of inflammable olefinic, paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic hydrocarbons (C4-C12). It presents low contents of oxygenates and traces of sulfur, nitrogen, and metals, which introduce instability to the mixture. In several countries, such as Brazil, ethanol is used purely as a renewable fuel or as an octane improver in blends with gasoline, especially in flex fuel engines. Nevertheless, some compounds in the fuel react slowly, at room temperature, with atmospheric oxygen, and with each other. The process is observed throughout the entire fuel production and use process and increases fuel density. These high-molar-mass insoluble oxidation products are commonly called gums and form deposits throughout the vehicle fuel system. Their accumulation has adverse effects on engine efficiency, performance, and durability, in the form of incomplete combustion, engine wear, and higher pollutant emissions. Consequently, it is necessary to prevent gum formation by improving gasoline quality and using additives. A prediction of gasoline blends behavior is also an important tool to assess critical conditions. This work studied the influence of aging period, temperature, and addition of anhydrous ethanol concentration on unwashed and washed gum content of Brazilian gasoline-ethanol blends. The effect of an additive was also evaluated, by comparing the results of regular and additivated gasolines.

To advance the scale-up of the CABR process, a mathematic model based on mass transfer with reaction in the gas, liquid, and biofilm was developed to simulate and predict the NOx removal by the CABR system in a biotrickling filter. The developed model was validated by the experimental results and subsequently was used to predict the system performance under different operating conditions, such as NO and O2 concentration and gas and liquid flow rate. NO distribution in the gas phase along the biotrickling filter was also modeled and predicted. On the basis of the modeling results, the liquid flow rate and total iron concentration were optimized to achieve &gt;90% NO removal efficiency.

For several types of components of a system, e.g. mechanical or electrical ones, the dynamic behavior can be described by means of a mathematic model consisting of a set of differential equations, difference equations and/or algebraic constraint equations. The knowledge of a realistic mathematic model and its parameter values is essential to represent the behaviour of a mechatronic system. Frequently it is hard or impossible to obtain all required values of the model parameters from the producer, so an appropriate parameter estimation technique is required to compute missing parameters. A manifold of parameter identification techniques can be found in the literature, but their suitability depends on the mathematic model. Previous work dealt with the automatic assembly of mathematical models of serial and parallel robots with drives and controllers within the dynamic multibody simulation code HOTINT as fully-fledged mechatronic simulation.

Differing from model-based approaches, the controller is in a linear parameterisation form and the controller parameters are tuned by fully using available collection data to address the practical difficulty in obtaining accurate dynamic model. Specifically, the internal iterative behaviour between the current parameter and the optimal parameter is firstly analysed with mathematic expression. Moreover, a novel iterative law based on the behaviour is proposed, which has the ability to directly seek the global optimal parameter that minimises the objective criterion. Furthermore, an unbiased gradient approximation based on the Toeplitz matrix is developed to simplify the practical implementation. Case studies are conducted by both simulation and experiment, and the results consistently indicate that the proposed tuning scheme not only guarantees the parameter converging to global minimum, but also possesses an excellent convergence rate.

However, degeneracy is often confused with redundancy. Furthermore, the quantification of degeneracy has not been addressed for realistic neuronal networks. The objective of this paper is to characterize degeneracy in neuronal network models via quantitative mathematic measures. Firstly, we establish Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal networks with Newman-Watts small world network architectures. Secondly, in order to calculate the degeneracy, redundancy and complexity in the ensuing networks, we use information entropy to quantify the information a neuronal response carries about the stimulus - and mutual information to measure the contribution of each subset of the neuronal network. Finally, we analyze the interdependency of degeneracy, redundancy and complexity - and how these three measures depend upon network architectures. Our results suggest that degeneracy can be applied to any neuronal network as a formal measure, and degeneracy is distinct from redundancy. Qualitatively degeneracy and complexity are more highly correlated over different network architectures, in comparison to redundancy. Quantitatively, the relationship between both degeneracy and redundancy depends on network coupling strength: both degeneracy and redundancy increase with complexity for small coupling strengths; however, as coupling strength increases, redundancy decreases with complexity (in contrast to degeneracy, which is relatively invariant). These results suggest that the degeneracy is a general topologic characteristic of neuronal networks, which could be applied quantitatively in neuroscience and connectomics. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Complexity; Neuronal networks; Redundancy","nervous system; network analysis; numerical model; Article; degeneracy; entropy; firing rate; Hodgkin Huxley equation; mathematical computing; mathematical model; nerve cell network; Newman Watts small world network; priority journal; redundancy analysis; stimulus response"

It varies with depth, the seasons, geographic location, and also time at a fixed location. In order to obtain the temporal and spatial statistical characteristics of temperature, the temperature field in the summer of 2013 was observed continuously at certain shallow water locations in the North China Sea, using vertically distributed multiple temperature and depth sensors. The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is an unsupervised neural network based on competitive learning, and can solve the problem when the center of clustering is unknown. The SOM's basic theory and algorithm are studied in this paper. A simulation example is given to prove the feasibility of SOM in oceanographic data cluster analysis. At the same time, reliable temperature samples of different depths and time are processed by SOM. Based on the clustering results over a long period or over a large area, multivariate linear regression analysis is carried out, and a mathematic model is established which describes the relationship between depth and temperature in shallow water. Finally, the change of temperature structure and its influence on sonar detection is simulated on the basis of the Fast Field Program (FFP) at some particular frequencies, and this is then discussed in detail.

A kinetic approach was used to assess the internalization mechanism of doxorubicin (Dox) loaded cationic liposomes and to establish physiology-based cell membrane traffic mathematic models. Lipid rafts-mediated endocytosis, including dynamin-dependent or -independent endocytosis of noncaveolar structure, was a dominant process. The mathematic models divided Dox loaded liposomes binding lipid rafts (B) into saturable binding (SB) and nonsaturable binding (NSB) followed by energy-driven endocytosis. The intracellular trafficking demonstrated early endosome-late endosome-lysosome or early/late endosome-cytoplasm-nucleus pathways. The three properties of liposome structures, i.e., cationic lipid, fusogenic lipid, and pegylation, were investigated to compare their contributions to cell membrane and intracellular traffic. The results revealed great contribution of cationic lipid DOTAP and fusogenic lipid DOPE to cell membrane binding and internalization. The valid Dox in the nuclei of HepG2 and A375 cells treated with cationic liposomes containing 40 mol% of DOPE were 1.2-fold and 1.5-fold higher than that in the nuclei of HepG2 and A375 cells treated with liposomes containing 20 mol% of DOPE, respectively, suggesting the dependence of cell type. This tendency was proportional to the increase of cell-associated total liposomal Dox.

To investigate the degree of influence of these parameters on calculation of models of land subsidence and ground fissures, Morris’ global sensitivity analysis, combined with local sensitivity analysis, was applied. The accuracy of soil parameter sensitivity analysis is related closely to selection of the calculation model used. Based on Biot’s consolidation theory, and combined with the nonlinear rheological theory of soil, a three-dimensional full coupling mathematic model was established to simulate land subsidence and ground fissures, in which the constitutive relation in Biot’s consolidation theory was extended to viscoelastic plasticity. The dynamic relationships of soil parameters (porosity, permeability coefficient, parameters of soil deformation) accompanied by changes in the stress field were also considered. Consequently, this model conforms to actual conditions in the field. Nantong, Jiangsu Province in China, was selected to simulate and calculate land subsidence and ground fissures using this model, and the soil parameters’ sensitivities were analyzed. The results showed that elastic modulus, E, cohesion, c, and the specific weight of soil, λ, have a significant influence on land subsidence and ground fissures, with the influence of the friction angle, φ, on land subsidence, and of Poisson’s ratio, ν, on ground fissures taking second place. These five parameters are thus of major concern in the simulation of land subsidence and ground fissures. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biot’s consolidation; Ground fissures; Groundwater; Land subsidence; Local sensitivity analysis; Morris’ global sensitivity analysis; Viscoelastic plasticity","Groundwater; Plasticity; Soils; Subsidence; Viscoelasticity; Global sensitivity analysis; Ground fissure; Land subsidence; Local sensitivity analysis; Viscoelastic plasticity; Sensitivity analysis"

The results revealed that the unconsolidated surficial cohesive sediment frequently experiences the processes of erosion, suspension and deposition. Wind waves, generated by the absorption of wind energy, are the principal force driving this cycle. When the wavelength-to-water depth ratio (L/D) is 2-3, wave propagation is affected by lakebed friction and surface erosion occurs. When L/D &gt; 3, the interaction between wave and lakebed increases to induce massive erosion. However, influenced by rapid urbanization in the Lake Taihu basin, wind speed has significantly decreased, by an average rate of -0.022 m s-1 a-1, from 1970 to 2013. This has reduced the erodible area, represented by simulated L/D, at a rate of -16.9 km2 a-1 in the autumn and winter, and -8.1 km2 a-1 in the spring and summer. This significant decrease in surface erosion area, and the near disappearance of areas experiencing massive erosion, imply that Lake Taihu has become calmer, which can be expected to have adverse effects on the lake ecosystem by increasing eutrophication and nuisance cyanobacteria blooms. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Decline in wind speed; Lacustrine cohesive sediment erosion; Lake Taihu; Ratio of wavelength to water depth (L/D); Sverdrup-Munk-Bretschneider (SMB) model; Wind waves",

Results of a previous study using renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as a model pointed towards cancer-related features, which could be visualized as three groups by microarray based gene expression analysis. In this study, we used a mathematic model to verify the presence of these groups in RCC as well as in other cancer types. We developed an algorithm for gene-expression deviation profiling for analyzing gene expression data of a total of 8397 patients with 13 different cancer types and normal tissues. We revealed three common Cancer Transcriptomic Profiles (CTPs) which recurred in all investigated tumors. Additionally, CTPs remained robust regardless of the functions or numbers of genes analyzed. CTPs may represent common genetic fingerprints, which potentially reflect the closely related biological traits of human cancers. © 2016 Beleut et al.

FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition competed by the senior men’s national teams. This contest is one of the most significant competitions among the humans in which people/teams try hard to overcome the others to earn the victory. In this competition there is only one winner which has the best position rather than the others. This paper introduces a new technique for optimization of mathematic functions based on FIFA World Cup competitions. The main difficulty of the optimization problems is that each type of them can be interpreted in a specific manner. World Cup Optimization (WCO) algorithm has a number of parameters to solve any type of problems due to defined parameters. For analyzing the system performance, it is applied on some benchmark functions. It is also applied on an optimal control problem as a practical case study to find the optimal parameters of PID controller with considering to the nominal operating points (Kg, Tg) changes of the AVR system. The main objective of the proposed system is to minimize the steady-state error and also to improve the transient response of the AVR system by optimal PID controller. Optimal values of the PID controller which are achieved by WCO algorithm are then compared with particle swarm optimization and imperialist competitive algorithm in different situations. Finally for illustrating the system capability against the disturbance, it is applied on a generator with disturbance on it and the results are compared by the other algorithms. The simulation results show the excellence of WCO algorithm performance into the nature base and other competitive algorithms. © 2016, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.","AVR system; Continuous optimization problems; Genetic algorithm; ICA; Meta-heuristic algorithm; Optimal PID control; Optimization; PSO algorithm; World Cup Optimization (WCO)","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Controllers; Electric control equipment; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Independent component analysis; Optimal control systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Proportional control systems; Three term control systems; AVR systems; Continuous optimization problems; Meta heuristic algorithm; Optimal PID control; PSO algorithms; World cup; Optimization"

However, up to now, the required effect sizes of interventions for reducing childhood overweight remain unclear. The calculation of the energy gap (excess calories consumed over calories expended) offers the possibility to estimate the required effect sizes. In this work 2 approaches to calculate the energy gap will be compared. Methods: Longitudinal data of 1690 children and adolescents of the Kiel Obesity Prevention Study (KOPS) on measured height, weight, fat mass and fat-free mass (using bioelectrical impedance analysis) at age 6 and 10 years will be used to calculate energy gap with 2 different approaches: (i) using age-independent changes in fat mass and fat-free mass (old approach) and (ii) using a mathematic model of weight dynamic (new approach). Results: Energy gap according to the old approach was 140 kcal/day; by contrast, new modeling resulted in an energy gap between 270 and 370 kcal/day. Both, BMI and fat mass were suitable to calculate energy gap and led to nearly same results. Exceeding the 90th percentile of BMI or fat mass (incidence approach) as well as large changes within the normal range (i.e. between the 10th and the 90th percentile) led to large energy gaps. Thus, all children with large energy gaps have to be characterized as at risk for overweight. Conclusion: The new approach seems to be convincing because it considered the additional energy expenditure for building fat-free mass due to increasing age and weight.Calculating energy gap offers a new approach for prevention of overweight. It shows that the required effect sizes of prevention measures have to be in a region of 140 to 400 kcal/day. This differs clearly from energy reduction of diets in the therapy of obesity. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.","children; energy gap; overweight; prevention","adolescent; adolescent health; caloric intake; child; child health; female; Germany; health promotion; human; male; Pediatric Obesity; preschool child; prevalence; preventive medicine; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; utilization; Adolescent; Adolescent Health; Child; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Energy Intake; Female; Germany; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Pediatric Obesity; Prevalence; Preventive Medicine; Treatment Outcome"

These methods are all designed to estimate the set of parameters that maximize the joint likelihood of observations in a given problem. While FOCE is still currently the most widely used method in population modeling, EM methods are getting more popular as the current-generation methods of choice because of their robustness with more complex models and sparse data structures. There are several versions of EM method implementation that are available in public modeling software packages. Although there have been several studies and reviews comparing the performance of different methods in handling relatively simple models, there has not been a dedicated study to compare different versions of EM algorithms in solving complex PBPK models. This study took everolimus as a model drug and simulated PK data based on published results. Three most popular EM methods (SAEM, IMP and QRPEM) and FOCE (as a benchmark reference) were evaluated for their estimation accuracy and converging speed when solving models of increased complexity. Both sparse and rich sampling data structure were tested. We concluded that FOCE was superior to EM methods for simple structured models. For more complex models and/ or sparse data, EM methods are much more robust. While the estimation accuracy was very close across EM methods, the general ranking of speed (fastest to slowest) was: QRPEM, IMP and SAEM. IMP gave the most realistic estimation of parameter standard errors, while under- and over- estimation of standard errors were observed in SAEM and QRPEM methods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Algorithm; Everolimus; Expectation-maximization methods; FOCE; Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling; Sparse data",

There are numerous reasons for that, among which are teachers’ and students’ unawareness that mathematics involves higher cognitive functions. Both the “number sense”, considered the innate start of logical-mathematical intelligence, and the “numeric core”, a cerebral cortical area located in the left parietal lobe which is responsible for processing sensory motor information, depend on an adequate stimulation to establish the bases of logical-mathematical potential development. The hands-on workshop named “Cognition and Logic” applied inclusive teaching materials adapted for visually impaired people in order to motivate and to promote sensory-motor stimulation and logical thinking through different games (tangram, Rubik′s cube, soma cube, and tower of Hanoi) at different levels of difficulty with the potential use for detection of highly talented students.

Therefore, the study of polyethylene wear is still of interest for the knee, particularly because few studies have investigated volumetric material loss in tibial knee inserts. For this study, a unique collection of autopsy-retrieved TKR and THR components that were well-functioning at the time of retrieval was used to compare volumetric wear differences between hip and knee polyethylene components made from identical material. Questions/purposes: The following questions were addressed: (1) How much did the hip liners wear and what wear patterns did they exhibit? (2) How much did the knee inserts wear and what wear patterns did they exhibit? (3) What is the ratio between TKR and THR wear after controlling for implantation time and patient age? Methods: We compared 23 THR components (Harris-Galante [HG] and HG II) and 20 TKR components (Miller-Galante [MG II]) that were retrieved postmortem. The components were made from the same polyethylene formulation and with similar manufacturing and sterilization (gamma-in-air) processes. Twenty-one patients (12 males, nine females) had THRs and 16 (four males, 12 females) had TKRs. Patients who had TKRs had an older (p = 0.001) average age than patients who had THRs (age, 75 years; SD, 10, versus 66 years; SD, 12, respectively). Only well-functioning components were included in this study. Therefore, implants retrieved postmortem from physically active patients and implanted for at least 2 years were considered. In addition, only normally wearing TKR components were considered, ie, those with fatigue wear (delamination) were excluded. The wear volume of each component was measured using metrology. For the tibial inserts an autonomous mathematic reconstruction method was used for quantification. Results: The acetabular liners of the THR group had a wear rate of 38 mm3 per year (95% CI, 29–47 mm3/year). Excluding patients with low-activity, the wear rate was 47 mm3 per year (95% CI, 37–56 mm3/year). The wear rate of normally wearing tibial inserts was 17 mm3 per year (95% CI, −6 to 40 mm3/year). After controlling for the relevant confounding variable of age, we found a TKR/THR wear rate ratio of 0.5 (95% CI, 0.29–0.77) at 70 years of age with a slightly increasing difference with increasing age. Conclusions: Excluding delamination, TKRs exhibited lower articular wear rates than THRs for historical polyethylene in these two unique cohorts of postmortem retrievals. Clinical Relevance: The lower TKR wear rate is in line with the lower incidence of osteolysis in TKRs compared with THRs. © 2016, The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons®.",,"polyethylene; adverse effects; age; aged; autopsy; biomechanics; chemistry; comparative study; device removal; devices; etiology; female; hip; hip replacement; human; knee; knee replacement; male; mechanical stress; middle aged; osteolysis; pathophysiology; prosthesis design; prosthesis failure; risk factor; surgery; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Autopsy; Biomechanical Phenomena; Device Removal; Female; Hip Joint; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Osteolysis; Polyethylene; Prosthesis Design; Prosthesis Failure; Risk Factors; Stress, Mechanical; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"

We use the new Markov random field (MRF) circuits, which can achieve ultra low power and high fault tolerance, as the analysis case.

Of the numerous processes involved in paper-making by a paper machine, the dryer section is the process that consumes the largest amount of energy. A model-based method for estimating energy-saving potentials of the dryer section was put forward in the present study. It was done by four steps: establishing a mathematical model about energy consumption, determining the model parameters, benchmarking the drying performance to obtain the corresponding energy-saving measures, and estimating the energy-saving potentials by using the mathematical model. In a case study, a multi-cylinder dryer section was selected to illustrate the method. After a fundamental field test and observation, several operating problems that restricted the energy performance of paper drying were found. And then several reasonable energy-saving measures were suggested to the operators. Finally, applying the mathematic model, it was found that 0.32 ton of steam will be saved when producing 1 ton of paper in recommended operating conditions. With the designed capacity of 200,000 tons/year, the annual steam-savings will be 64,000 tons.

In this study, the wetting properties of silicon and silicon nitride AFM tips are investigated through dynamic contact angle measurement using a nano-Wilhelmy balance based method. This is done by capillary force measurement during extension and retraction motion of AFM tips relative to interfacial nanobubbles. The working principle of the proposed method and mathematic models for dynamic contact angle measurement are presented. Geometric models of AFM tips were constructed using scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) images taken from different view directions. The detailed process of tip-nanobubble interaction was investigated using force-distance curves of AFM on nanobubbles. Several parameters including nanobubble height, adhesion and capillary force between tip and nanobubbles are extracted. The variation of these parameters was studied over nanobubble surfaces.

There are already some researches in anomaly detection focusing on single user behavior, while the distribution of group user behaviors is considered in this paper. A novel method using cross entropy model which is usually used for networking attacking in computer network is proposed to detect anomalies of offline user behavior in wireless network. Moreover, to make the anomaly detection available in different scenes, cross entropy model is optimized by using membership function of fuzzy mathematic. Experiments conducted in campus, hotel and office satisfy the expected results, which verify the feasibility and efficiency.

Quantitative studies have found a decline in activity in the transition from primary to secondary education. Exergames (active video games) might increase physical activity in adolescents. In January 2011 exergame dance mat systems were introduced in to all secondary schools across two local authority districts in the UK. We performed a quasi-experimental evaluation of a natural experiment using a mixed methods design. The quantitative findings from this work have been previously published. The aim of this linked qualitative study was to explore the implementation of the dance mat scheme and offer insights into its uptake as a physical activity intervention. Methods: Embedded qualitative interviews at baseline and 12 month follow-up with purposively selected physical education teachers (n = 20) and 25 focus groups with a convenience sample of pupils (n = 120) from five intervention schools were conducted. Analysis was informed by sociology of translation approach. Results: At baseline, participants (both teachers and pupils) reported different expectations about the dance mats and how they could be employed. Variation in use was seen at follow-up. In some settings they were frequently used to engage hard to reach groups of pupils. Overall, the dance mats were not used routinely to increase physical activity. However there were other unanticipated benefits to pupils such as improved reaction time, co-ordination and mathematic skills. The use of dance mats was limited in routine physical education classes because of contextual issues (school/government policy) technological failures (batteries/updates) and because of expectations about how and where they could be used. Conclusions: Our linked quantitative study (previously published) suggested that the dance mats were not particularly effective in increasing physical activity, but the qualitative results (reported here) show that the dance mats were not used routinely enough to show a significant effect on physical activity of the intervention. This research demonstrates the benefit of using mixed methods to evaluate complex physical activity interventions. Those planning any intervention for promoting physical activity in schools need to understand the distinction between physical activity and physical education. © 2016 The Author(s).","Children; Exergaming; Physical activity; Qualitative; Sociology of translation","convenience sample; coordination; dancing; expectation; experimental model; follow up; government; high school; human; information processing; interview; major clinical study; physical activity; physical education; qualitative research; quantitative study; reaction time; skill; sociology; teacher"

It requires adequate design and conscientious management. Soil water movement process is an important content of drip irrigation system design and operation management. Soil infiltration has important impacts on soil water movement and distribution process. Therefore, in this study, the automatic measurement system for point source infiltration of soil was used to measure the wetted areas at soil surface and the wetted depths of soil profile through image recognition technology and computer-controlled digital camera in real time. The digital camera was used to take images of the run-on water advancing in real time before they were processed and then by analysis the wetted areas were determined. According to the wetted soil surface areas, the system automatically computed the soil infiltration rate with the mathematic models outlined in the point source run-on method before the infiltration curve could be displayed on the real-time basis. The soil infiltration measurement system was based on the advancing process of the wetted radius at the soil surface under point source of water supply and based upon the assumption of the ellipsoid-shaped wetted soil body and the principle of water balance. An equilateral triangular-prism soil box of 50 cm long and 50 cm high, which was made of plexiglass, was used in this study for indoor drip irrigation experimental tests, to measure the processes of infiltration and water movement processes. Transparent plastic sheets were pasted on 2 side walls of the soil boxes. The soil materials, with the texture of silty loam consisting of 15% clay, 50.2% silt and 34.8% sand particles, were air-dried before passing through a 2 mm sieve, and then packed into the soil box in 5 cm depth layer at a bulk density of 1.3 g/cm3. The experiments involved 3 dripper discharge rates of 2, 4 and 8 L/h, with 3 replicates. Digital camera that was connected to and controlled by a computer was used to take picture of wetted areas at soil surface in 4 min time interval to get the changing process of the wetted surface areas. Meanwhile, at the time moments of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160 and 180 min, the surface wetting radius and vertical wetting front process were also manually recorded by using the transparent plastic sheets. AUTOCAD software was used to highlight the wetted surface areas and the wetting fronts before measuring the wetted radius at the surface and the vertical wetted areas by infiltration water. Based on the data, the soil infiltration process under point source was calculated by the automatic measuring system. The wetted surface areas and the vertical wetted areas by infiltration water were computed through the recorded images. The calculated infiltration results were compared with the measured data to verify the accuracy of the measurement. The results showed that the manually measured wetted surface areas were slightly larger than those measured by the automatic measurement system for soil infiltration under point source. The relative measurement errors in wetted soil surface areas were 2%-15%. The predicted vertical infiltration depths calculated by the computed infiltration rate were slightly higher than the manually measured soil infiltration depths. The errors in infiltration depth between the estimated and the manually measured were 1%-8%. Philip and Kostiakov infiltration models/equations were used to fit the measured infiltration processes. Kostiakov equation provided better predictions of the infiltration processes and Philip model produced dramatically different and irrational stable infiltration rates (negative values). The research results indicate that the automatic measurement system can accurately describe the point source surface wetting process of drip irrigation and soil water infiltration process, and can be used to predict the vertical infiltration depth under different dripper discharge. Soil infiltration automatic measurement system has realized the automation in the soil infiltration measurement under point source. The system and the method are verified by laboratory test data, which can provide basic tools to get the parameters of drip irrigation system, and the relevant reference for the design of drip irrigation system. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Madagascar was heavily affected by RVF in 2008–2009, with evidence of a large and heterogeneous spread of the disease. The identification of at-risk environments is essential to optimize the available resources by targeting RVF surveillance in Madagascar. Herein, the objectives of our study were: (i) to identify the environmental factors and areas favorable to RVF transmission to both cattle and human and (ii) to identify human behaviors favoring human infections in Malagasy contexts. Methodology/Principal Findings: First, we characterized the environments of Malagasy communes using a Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA). Then, we analyzed cattle and human serological data collected at national level using Generalized Linear Mixed Models, with the individual serological status (cattle or human) as the response, and MFA factors, as well as other potential risk factors (cattle density, human behavior) as explanatory variables. Cattle and human seroprevalence rates were positively associated to humid environments (p<0.001). Areas with high cattle density were at risk (p<0.01; OR = 2.6). Furthermore, our analysis showed that frequent contact with raw milk contributed to explain human infection (OR = 1.6). Finally, our study highlighted the eastern-coast, western and north-western parts as high-risk areas for RVF transmission in cattle. Conclusions/Significance: Our integrated approach analyzing environmental, cattle and human datasets allow us to bring new insight on RVF transmission patterns in Madagascar. The association between cattle seroprevalence, humid environments and high cattle density suggests that concomitant vectorial and direct transmissions are critical to maintain RVF enzootic transmission. Additionally, in the at-risk humid environment of the western, north-western and the eastern-coast areas, suitable to Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes, vectorial transmission probably occurs in both cattle and human. The relative contribution of vectorial or direct transmissions could be further assessed by mathematic modelling. © 2016 Olive et al.",,"adult; aged; Anopheles; Article; bovine; cross-sectional study; disease surveillance; disease transmission; environmental factor; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; Madagascar; male; nonhuman; population dynamics; Rift Valley fever; risk factor; seroprevalence; animal; blood; Cattle Diseases; Culex; environment; insect vector; middle aged; physiology; Rift Valley fever; Rift Valley fever virus; seroepidemiology; transmission; virology; young adult; virus antibody; Adult; Animals; Anopheles; Antibodies, Viral; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Culex; Environment; Female; Humans; Insect Vectors; Madagascar; Male; Middle Aged; Rift Valley Fever; Rift Valley fever virus; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Young Adult"

Meanwhile, the development of demand response (DR) provides load serving entities (LSEs) opportunities to perform coupon based demand response (CBDR) programs, and thus LSEs can behave as strategic bidders in the whole-sale market by adjusting its demand level. In the existing approaches for modelling CBDR, the potential impact of FTR which leads LSEs to obtain the congestion compensation under a high load level is overlooked. Therefore, this study proposes a comprehensive strategic CBDR model in which the LSE's profit is maximised by providing CBDR to customers and the congestion compensation from the LSE bidder's FTR holding is also considered. The proposed model is formulated as a bi-level optimisation problem with the LSE's net revenue maximisation as the upper level and the ISO's economic dispatch considering wind power uncertainty as the lower level problem. The bi-level model is addressed with mathematic program with equilibrium constraints technique and mixed-integer linear programming, which can be solved using available optimisation software tools.

However, the existing researches on the rotor blades pay little attention to the mechanism of the time-domain and time-frequencydomain flash phenomena. To comprehensively explain the flash phenomena from physics, the modeling of the rotor blades and the mechanism of the flash phenomena are studied in this paper. Firstly, for the rotor blades, the target cannot be represented as a rigid, homogeneous line nor several points. Taking the scattering coefficients and the interval of adjacent scattering points (the scattering point distribution on the blade) into consideration, the scattering point model of the rotor blade echo is established, and the influence of the scattering point distribution on the radar echo is analyzed as well. The detailed mathematic analysis and comparison results show that the conventional integral model of the rotor blade is only a special case of the scattering point model. Furthermore, in the case where the scattering point model is approximately equivalent to the conventional integral model, the critical interval of adjacent scattering points is deduced by mathematic analysis. Secondly, on the basis of the proposed model above, the physical mechanism of the time-domain and time-frequency-domain flash phenomena is studied from the viewpoint of the electromagnetic (EM) scattering. On the one hand, considering the EM scattering and scattering point distribution, the mechanism of the time-domain flashes is analyzed. Ideally, when the rotor blade is at the vertical position relative to the radar line of sight, i. e., at the flash time, the blade has the strongest echo. At this moment, the radar echo consists of echoes of all scattering points, thus inducing the time-domain flashes. At the non-flash time, the scattering points at the tip of blade and hub of rotor have stronger scattering intensities, so the echo is much weaker than that at the flash time. On the other hand, the time-frequency analysis and the cross range resolution are simultaneously used to analyze the mechanism of the time-frequency-domain flashes in the m-D signature. The m-D signature of the rotor blades consists of three parts: the time-frequency-domain flashes, the sinusoidal Doppler curves, and the zero-frequency band. At the flashes time, the Doppler frequency of adjacent scattering points cannot be distinguished, thus the m-D signature has the frequency band caused by all scattering points, i. e., the time-frequency-domain flashes appear. At the non-flash time, the sinusoidal Doppler curves and the zero-frequency band are caused by the scattering points at the tip of blade induced by the scattering points at the hub of rotor respectively. Finally, the simulation results about the scattering point model with the different intervals of adjacent scattering points show that the effectiveness of the proposed model and the correctness of theoretical analysis. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society.","Electromagnetic scattering; Flashes; Micro-Doppler; Scattering points model","Electromagnetic wave scattering; Frequency bands; Radar; Rigid rotors; Time domain analysis; Turbomachine blades; Cross-range resolution; Electromagnetic scattering; Flashes; Micro-Doppler; Scattering co-efficient; Scattering intensity; Time frequency analysis; Time frequency domain; Frequency domain analysis"

However, stress distribution on fracture faces is simplified in the current calculation methods of fracture width, so it is unable to effectively use the field measured data, which may lead to errors in dynamic fracture width prediction. Based on the above defect of classic models, a numerical fracture width calculation model considering arbitrary complex stress distribution was established, in which original complex stress is dispersed into a number of rectangular uniform stresses and then the final fracture width expression is obtained through superimposition principle. After the contrast validation of analytical solution, the simulation accuracy of numerical fracture width model is improved with discrete unit number rising, indicating a very high practical value. The geo-stress disturbance analysis shows that with the increase in amplitude or decrease in frequency of geo-stress fluctuating, the differences between the calculation results of classic simplified model and actual fracture width will be enlarged gradually; in case of a very high fluctuating frequency of geo-stress, fracture width is volatile significantly, thus greatly increasing the intra-fracture flow resistance. When this model is applied to field case, an obvious necking phenomenon will occur to the fracture width obtained through simulated output in high-stress inter-layers.

However, the bang-bang controller of the DTC causes high torque ripples. To solve this problem, the mathematic models of commutation and diode freewheeling of the inactive phase were established and the relationship between torque and phase current was obtained. Then a torque prediction method based on the established models was proposed to reduce the torque ripple effectively, and the stability and robustness were proved. While estimating the back electromotive force of the BLDCM with sliding mode observer (SMO), a smooth and continuous function with one parameter was employed to replace the sign function which leads to a higher back electromotive force estimation accuracy.

Firstly, the influence of the aberration caused by adjustment error on the system optical transfer function (MTF) in theory, whereby the mathematic model for describing the relationship of them was established. Based on the model, the adjustment error of 4f optical imaging system of 1 μm resolution was derived, and the influence of lens eccentricity, incline and displacement on the MTF was simulated, thus the variations of the resolution with the errors were achieved.

However, a lot of sodium ions in the flux would be introduced into sample solution and lead to high salinity with the pretreatment by alkali fusion. The high salinity could cause matrix interference and cone-hole blocking, which is disadvantageous to determination of trace rare earth elements by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In order to solve this problem, the sample was fused with NaOH and Na2O2 at high temperature followed by leaching and filtration with hot water. Then the rare earth elements were enriched into rare earth hydroxide precipitates, realizing the separation from much sodium and other metallic ions such as potassium, tungsten and molybdenum. The precipitate was dissolved with tartaric acid-HCl system. After dilution, the content of rare earth elements in tungsten ore and molybdenum ore was determined by ICP-MS.

According to the topology of the grid-connected inverter, the control strategy is determined, which adopts the PCI control as inner current control loop and the voltage control with power source as outer control loop. The controller design process is obtained by deriving the mathematic model of this inverter under αβ stationary frame reference. At first, the PCI inner current loop is analyzed and calculated to obtain the fast response and wide bandwidth. The gain of the open loop transfer function after compensation is infinite at grid frequency (50 Hz) to realize the zero static error of grid current to keep the system stable. Besides, the bandwidth is chosen as 700 Hz according to the switching frequency to satisfy the system requirement, which can effectively improve the steady-state and dynamic performances of inner current loop. Secondly, the direct current (DC) voltage outer loop is adopted, which contains a compensation term, a current close loop and a transfer function from active power to the square of DC voltage. The compensation term is determined by considering the feature of this system. In order to eliminate the phase delay of PCI inner current loop, the crossing frequency is set to a lower value. By designing this compensation term, the stability of DC voltage in power source system and the reliable operation of the inverter system for grid-connection are realized respectively. A simulation model based on Matlab/Simulink is built to examine the correctness of the control algorithm. The input source is the power source. And the output of the inverter is connected directly to the grid with three-phase inductance. The transient time at start is approximately 0.1 s, and the total harmonic distortion (THD) of grid-side current is about 2.04%. When the input power increases to the rated power, the response time of current is 0.2 s and the THD is about 1.18%. The simulated results show the availability of this proposed method for the control of the grid-connected inverter. On the basis of the theory and the simulation, the digital controller is implemented by using TMS320F2812 digital signal processing (DSP) and combined with variable speed wind power system. At start, the response of the output current is quick to be stable with 4 cycles. And the overshoot is lower and decreases the shock to power system. When the input power changes, the current loop response is fast to be stable with 2 cycles and hardly overshoots. Meanwhile, the DC outer loop realizes the stability of voltage with 0.2 s, obtaining the good steady-state and dynamic performance. The results also show that the inverter can satisfy the requirement of grid to keep the power factor above 0.97 and the current harmonic about 2.13%. The simulation and the experiment results illustrate that the proposed PCI control method for power source input inverter is available and effective. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In this paper, therefore, the consistency index of geotechnics was introduced after water influx prediction model was analyzed. The mathematic model for simulating bit balling situations after water breakthrough was established by taking the adhesion limit of clay as the critical condition of bit balling. The model was solved by using the calculation program and the calculation results were analyzed to predict the risk of bit balling. And then, the factors influencing bit balling were analyzed, including lithology, bit surface properties and drilling parameters. It is shown that the forming time of bit balling after water breakthrough can be predicted by using the model established in this paper. Bit balling risk is predicted and assessed with the balling occurrence time as an indicator. Bit balling is greatly influenced by the lithology and the bit surface properties. Furthermore, the risk of bit balling decreases with the increase of ROP (rate of penetration), wellhead back pressure, well depth and hole diameter enlargement rate. It is concluded that the time interval between water breakthrough and bit balling is very short and downhole accidents happen within a few minutes. Therefore, it is necessary to complete aquifer prediction in advance and prepare sufficiently for drilling mode change. Once water breakthrough happens, it is significant to take some appropriate measures to delay the occurrence of bit balling based on the numerical simulation results. © 2016, Natural Gas Industry Journal Agency.

Although several reflectometry methods have been proved to be effective technologies for locating open and short circuits on wires, they do not assess well the faults, such as abrasions and frays. This paper analyzes the feasibility of a combination of the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) and wavelet method for detecting the faults on aircraft lossy shielded coaxial cables. A mathematic model is presented for simulating the propagation of wave in the cable with the fault based on TDR. A step wave generator with a steep rising edge is constructed and implemented to detect the faults. The wavelet method is used to eliminate the noise as well as to locate the small reflections in the TDR wave. Results show that the shortened rise time of step wave has a positive effect on the voltage reflection coefficients of the fault, which is conducive to detecting the faults. The recognition capability of the faults can be improved through de-noising and singularity detection by the wavelet method. But as the attenuation and the extension of the rise time of the wave, the method introduced cannot meet completely all the requirements of fault diagnosis. In particular, it is almost impossible to detect the small fault. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Aircraft cables; fault detection; reflection coefficient","Aircraft detection; Cables; Electric fault currents; Permittivity measurement; Reflection; Reflectometers; Time domain analysis; Wavelet transforms; Aircraft cables; Mathematic model; Propagation of waves; Singularity detection; Time domain reflectometry; Voltage reflection coefficient; Wavelet methods; Wiring systems; Fault detection"

So far no approach to extract the fast component of quartz OSL has routinely been adopted for dating practice. Key challenges for extracting fast components are (1) the difficulty of finding a unique solution in curve-fitting deconvolution of OSL decay curves and (2) the relatively poor dating precision when using experimental fast component extraction. Here, a simple mathematic solution for fast component extraction is presented that is not relying on curve-fitting deconvolution and can easily be adopted into routine dating practices. By using specifically selected data points from smoothed OSL decay curves, the precision of equivalent doses calculated using the extracted fast component can be improved over equivalent doses calculated using bulk OSL. The fast component extraction is tested on a group of age-constrained samples containing both insufficiently bleached and sufficiently bleached deposits. Fast component OSL ages are as accurate as bulk OSL ages for the sufficiently bleached deposits, but more accurate for samples where bulk OSL is affected by insufficient bleaching. We also demonstrate how using a curve smoothing procedure can improve dating precision in case of both sufficiently and insufficiently bleached deposits. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

An adiabatic and visible experiment flat form was built to study the effect of wettability on the phase interface movement and the separation with a super-hydrophobic and a super-hydrophilic mesh. As the result, the super-hydrophobic and super-hydrophilic mesh showed the self-compatibility. With this ability the super-hydrophilic mesh can block bubbles from flowing through, while the super-hydrophobic mesh can hold a column of liquid by counteracting gravity.

The modulation of wettability of porous mesh can promote the phases separating which will widen their applications on phase change heat transfer fields. © All Right Reserved.","Phase interface; Porous film; Self-compatibility; Two-phase flow; Wettability","Heat transfer; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Interfaces (materials); Liquid films; Liquids; Mesh generation; Porous materials; Two phase flow; Wetting; Critical diameter; Gas-liquid interface; Interface movement; Phase change heat transfer; Porous film; Self-compatibility; Separation of bubbles; Two-phase flow experiments; Phase interfaces"

The water hydraulic piston pump has become a key component in the field of water hydraulic technology. The paper describes the invention of a new mechanism which translates rotational movement into linear motion for application in a water hydraulic piston pump. The kinematic and dynamitic models of the mechanism were built and simulation was accomplished based on the mathematic models. Simulation results were analyzed and compared with a traditional swashplate slipper pump. Comparison results indicated that this mechanism could reduce the number of tribology pairs and reaction force between piston and cylinder block. The lateral force was only 1/18 of that for a swashplate slipper piston pump. The value of product between pressure and velocity (PV value) for the piston was small, resulting in a great reduction in friction and wear for the piston-cylinder couples. The new pump was tested in a flow test apparatus. The experimental results showed that the pump achieved a volumetric efficiency of up to 92% at the required flow rate and operating pressure. The pump was found to have steady and excellent operating characteristics.

With the increasing importance of the network bandwidth in the Cloud environment, the networking related resources need to be optimally allocated together with the traditional Cloud computing resources. In addition, the significant growth of the global data center traffic raises the challenge of supporting demands with large bandwidth requirements for the Cloud provider. In our paper, we consider the network-efficient virtualized cloud infrastructure provisioning problem in IP over elastic optical network (IP-over-EON) based on the data center as a service model. The elastic optical network is adopted to provide spectrum and cost-efficient networking resources for large bandwidth requests in our work. We develop mixed integer linear programming formulations to construct the mathematic model for this problem and propose a cost-optimized heuristic to solve this problem. To investigate the cost and blocking rate for the served demands, different modulation formats are compared in the EON layer, and the sliceable bandwidth-variable transponders and optical traffic grooming technology are considered. The experimental results show that different modulation formats that are adopted in the EON layer will have different impacts on the total cost and demand blocking rate for the same data set size. Also the use of SBVT will reduce the total cost no matter which modulation format is adopted, and the reduction is related to the bandwidth requirement of the demands. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cloud; EON; Flex-grid; Multi-layer; Resource provisioning; S-BVT","Bandwidth; Cloud computing; Clouds; Costs; Integer programming; Modulation; Optimization; Problem solving; Bandwidth requirement; Elastic optical networks; EON; Flex-grid; Mixed integer linear programming; Optical traffic grooming; Resource provisioning; S-BVT; Distributed computer systems"

Aims: The aim of this study was to create and validate a new PIG technique using minimum graft area to correct simple or complex penile curvature with or without hourglass deformity, while avoiding mechanical and geometric abnormalities. Methods: Using our cotton fabric model, we created a mathematic solution for PIG with no residual defects. This was applied in nine men who had sufficient penile rigidity while penetrating their respective partners. They underwent fascia lata patch corporoplasty using the new developed technique (iPad [Apple Corp, Palo Alto, CA, USA] app: iGrafter). Subjects answered the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire preoperatively and at the end of follow-up. Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measures used were patient demographics, erectile function, residual curvature, patient satisfaction, graft area, and complications. Results: After a mean follow-up of 17.8 months, no significant complication was noted. Complete penile straightening was achieved in all patients. The short side of the penis increased a mean of 3 cm in length, and the mean graft area was 12.4 cm2. At the end of the follow-up, three patients developed recurrent deformity. One patient presented severe fibrosis in the corpora cavernosa and severe ED. There was no significant difference between the mean preoperative and postoperative IIEF-5 scores (20.6 vs 19.4, respectively). At the end of follow-up, all patients were able to have sexual intercourse (two with and seven without pharmacological aid). Eight of the nine patients were satisfied with the surgical result. Conclusion: Penile curvature surgical correction using the iGrafter seems to be an efficient and safe procedure, which uses minimum graft area and preserves erectile function after penile rectification, without resulting in residual deformities. Further research is needed to confirm the efficacy of this procedure. © 2016 The Authors.","Computerized Analysis; Erectile Dysfunction; Graft; Peyronie's Disease; Surgery","prostavasin; sildenafil; adult; aged; Article; bandage; clinical article; computer assisted surgery; corpus cavernosum; erectile dysfunction; fascia lata patch corporoplasty; Foley balloon catheter; follow up; human; International Index of Erectile Function; male; middle aged; mobile application; patient satisfaction; penile extender; penile fibrosis; penis erection; penis glans hypesthesia; Peyronie disease; plaque incision and graft; postoperative complication; priority journal; recurrent disease; sexual intercourse; surgical technique; treatment outcome; urologic surgery; validation study"

Nowadays the state-of-art static earth sensor employs a focal plane infrared detector to cover the entire earth infrared irradiation circle. As a result, aiming at the near space vehicles at the height of 70~100 km, the earth sensor needs to have a very large field of view (FOV) (>120°) and the relative accuracy is poor. In this paper, aiming at the near space vehicle astronomical navigation application, a triple-FOV (field of view) infrared earth sensor is designed using line CCDs as the detectors. Three FOVs of the earth sensor are uniformly distributed in 2-dimensional angle in space, which guarantees that each optical head is uniformly pointing to the spots on the earth infrared irradiation circle. Each CCD only covers an FOV of 20°, therefore the boundary points between earth irradiation and space are accurately distinguished. Comprehensively considering the earth irradiation model, the earth oblateness and etc., from the observation vectors obtained by the earth sensor, the earth horizon, geocentric vector and flying altitude could be simultaneously obtained in the near space vehicle coordinate system. Taking the flight altitude of 70~ 100 km as an example, the related mathematic model was established, and the algorithm for determining the flying attitude and altitude was proposed, and the simulation was conducted. Upon this analysis, a prototype of triple-FOV earth sensor was built and related tests were conducted. The simulation and experiment results show that the altitude measurement accuracy is better than 200 m, and the altitude measurement accuracy is better than 0.002°. © 2016, Science Press.

Inattention, hyperacti-vity, and impulsivity are key symptoms of ADHD. It is typicallyassociated with working memory deficits at the cognitive level.For this reason, interventions have been designed to train workingmemory in ADHD. Currently, Cogmed Working Memory Trainingprogram is the most commonly used and studied program in clinicalpractice and research. This program is proposed as an interven-tion for ADHD that targets working memory deficits with specificexercises through intensive training sessions.Objectives. - The goal of this literature review is to examine theeffects of the Cogmed program in children and adolescents withADHD on working memory, inhibition, non-verbal reasoning, atten-tion functioning, ADHD symptoms and academic achievement. Allexisting studies on the subject that included a control group (n = 8)are reviewed.Results. - It is clear from most studies that Cogmed training pro-gram increases and verbal and visuospatial working memory (or thephonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad in Baddeley's model(1986, 2007), among ADHD participants. However, transfer of lear-ning is not demonstrated on other components of working memorythat are not directly targeted by the program such as the centralexecutive described in Baddeley's model or the secondary memorydefined by Unsworth & Engle (2007). With regards to far transfermeasures, results are controversial for inhibition, non-verbal rea-soning, ADHD symptoms reported by parents, and reading abilities.No improvement is demonstrated for attentional capacities, ADHDsymptoms reported by teachers and mathematic reasoning.Conclusion. - Cogmed training improves verbal and visuospatialworking memory, two cognitive functions that play an importantrole in ADHD. However, Cogmed's exercises need to be modified inorder to train more complex working memory components suchas the central executive (Baddeley, 1986, 2007) and the secon-dary memory (Unsworth & Engle, 2007), which are more impairedin ADHD than the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad.Another approach would be to design programs that can tackle alarger range of cognitive functions that are impaired in ADHD (e.g.,inhibition). In future, studies evaluating such modified programs,direct observation instruments that are more sensitive to short-term changes need to be included. Follow-up measures should alsobe systematically included. © 2015 Société française de psychologie. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

This temperature gradient will affect the deep dielectric charging (DDC) by changing the material conductivity. We put forward a mathematic model in which the temperature gradient in DDC is taken into account. An efficient numerical solution was given for the one-dimensional charging model with corresponding verification. In this model, the effect of temperature gradient was taken into account by correlating with material conductivity. Selecting polyimide (Kapton) as the typical satellite dielectric, we carried out measurement and made data fitting to obtain a temperature spectrum of conductivity within the range of 253~353 K. For radiation induced conductivity (RIC), Geant 4 simulation was adopted to get the radiation dose rate and then RIC was calculated using an empirical formula. The computation results show that temperature gradient has a notable influence on DDC. Under the energetic electron flux of GEO serious radiation, a back grounded Kapton board, with the thickness of 3 mm and the grounding boundary temperature 263 K, will charge to more than -10 kV with the electric field in magnitude of 10 MV/m.

Afterward, the optimal mixed integer linear programming (MILP) mathematic model was created for the AGC strategy considering the primary frequency regulation under the control performance standard (CPS) in the interconnected power grids. In the proposed model, the state variables of the AGC regulating command were indicated as the three-state variables instead of two-state ones according to the characteristic of power system. Meanwhile, the traditional nonlinear equation of the minimal acceleration/deceleration time constraints is linearized.

Methods: This mathematic model was a regular cylinder quantifying appropriate puncture routes from the bottom up. A total of 103 patients with hepatic dome tumors were enrolled and randomly divided into 2 groups based on whether this model was used or not: Group A (using the model; n = 43) versus Group B (not using the model; n = 60). All tumors were treated by CT-guided MW ablation and follow-up contrast CT were reviewed. Results: The average number of times for successful puncture, average ablation time, and incidence of right shoulder pain were less in Group A than Group B (1.4 vs. 2.5, P = 0.001; 8.8 vs. 11.1 minutes, P = 0.003; and 4.7% vs. 20%, P = 0.039). The technical success rate was higher in Group A than Group B (97.7% vs. 85.0%, P = 0.032). There were no significant differences between the two groups in primary and secondary technique efficacy rates (97.7% vs. 88.3%, P = 0.081; 90.0% vs. 72.7%, P = 0.314). No major complications occurred in both groups. Conclusion: The mathematic model of regular cylinder is feasible and safe for CT-guided MW ablation in treating hepatic dome tumors.","CT-guided; Hepatic dome; Mathematic model; Microwave ablation; Tumors","adult; aged; Article; cancer control; cancer survival; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; controlled study; feasibility study; female; follow up; hepatic dome tumor; human; human tissue; liver biopsy; liver hematoma; liver tumor; lung hemorrhage; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; microwave thermotherapy; outcome assessment; overall survival; patient safety; pneumothorax; preoperative period; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; shoulder pain; tumor free survival"

Freeze-drying (lyophilisation) is the preferred method to achieve a stable product with an increased shelf-life. During batch freeze-drying, there are only two adaptable process variables, i.e. the shelf temperature and the pressure in the drying chamber. The value of both should be optimized, preferably in a dynamic way, to minimise the primary drying time while respecting process and equipment constraints and ensuring end product quality. A mechanistic model is used to determine the optimal values for the adaptable variables, hereby accounting for the uncertainty in all involved model parameters. A dynamic Design Space was constructed with a risk of failure acceptance level of 0.01%, i.e. a 'zero-failure' situation. Even for a risk of failure of 0.01%, the computed settings resulted in a reduction of the drying time by over 50% compared to current practice.","Dynamic Design Space; Freeze-drying; Mathematic modeling",

Objective: To analyze the unbalance vibration characteristics and design the suitable dynamic balance method for rigid rotor system, the method of modeling and simulation is utilized in the paper. Method: Based on the principle of rotor dynamics, the mathematic model is built firstly between the vibration response and unbalance excitation. According to double-face dynamic balance principle, the correction of correcting face is made equivalent to the unbalance excitation of the rotor system, and then the mathematic model is developed with double-face correcting function. The matlab language is applied to design the simulation program for the dynamic balance model. Results: Based on simulation analysis, the relations are analyzed between unbalance vibration response and rotating frequency, influence coefficient and rotating frequency, influence coefficient and axial positions of correcting face in the paper. The analysis results prove that the modeling method for double-face dynamic balance of rigid rotor system is reasonable.

It is urgently needed a control method with a fine speed-synchronization performance and a practical engineering application. With the theoretical derivation, the mathematic simulation and the experimental verification, a kind of composite synchronization control strategy based on nonlinear feedforward compensation was put forward. The mathematic model of this control strategy was established. The co-simulation of AMESim and Simulink on this control system was used to validate its feasibility.

It allows the evaluation of a response to therapy according PERCIST 1.0. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of a method for the estimation of the LBM using the data of the low-dose CT from PET/CT acquired over standard acquisition fields (from skull base to ischia, from vertex to ischia, from skull base tomid thigh, from vertex to mid thigh). Methods: We wrote an automated program that determined the LBM from a CT with limited fields of acquisition and applied this method in a large (184 patients) and heterogeneous population. Its results were compared with the measurement of LBM from whole-body CT (reference standard) and the results of 5 predictive equations described in the literature. Results: The results of LBM measurement evaluated with this technique were much closer to the reference standard than those obtained by the mathematic formulas. The intraclass correlations (ICC) of this technique compared with the reference standard were excellent (the best ICC being obtained for the largest acquisition field, from vertex to mid thigh: ICC, 0.994; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.992 0.995; P , 0.0001), much better than the ICC obtained with the mathematic formulas (the best ICC for a mathematic formula was 0.841; 95% CI, 0.714 0.903; P , 0.0001). Moreover, the analysis with the Bland Altman plot showed that the differences in mean lean masses between the studied technique and the reference standard was the smallest for the proposed technique (for the largest acquisition field, mean difference 0.2 kg with the narrowest 95% CI [-1.8 to 2.2 kg]).

Similar to the previously developed by us model of primary DNA structure [11-15], 3D structure of DNA molecule is assembled in accordance to a mathematic rule known as Fibonacci sequence. Unlike primary DNA structure, supramolecular 3D structure is assembled from complex moieties including a regular tetrahedron and a regular octahedron consisting of monomers, elements of the primary DNA structure. The moieties of the supramolecular DNA structure forming fragments of regular spatial lattice are bound via linker (joint) sequences of the DNA chain. The lattice perceives and transmits information signals over a considerable distance without acoustic aberrations.

The general methods were proposed to minimize torque ripple and suspension force ripple. Based on the working principle of bearingless asynchronous motor with outer rotor, the mathematic model of motor was deduced. According to the traditional asynchronous motor design method, a 0.5 kW bearingless asynchronous motor with outer rotor was designed by dichotomy approach with two pole-pair torque winding and one pole-pair radial suspension winding. The distribution of magnetic field was simulated by FEM, and the relationship among radial suspension force, torque and winding current was determined. The effects of magnetic saturation and size of airgap on radial suspension force were also investigated with consideration of the effects of slot ratio and stator pole arc coefficient. The results show that with respective torque windings and radial suspension force windings rated currents of 2.5 A and 2.0 A, the rotor of prototype motor can be stably suspended with torque of 1 N·m and rotor radial suspension force of 105 N. © 2016, Editorial Department of Journal of Jiangsu University.

This work used airborne gamma-ray spectrometry and altimetry to identify domains with higher probability of occurrence of lateritic crust and dismantling products in an area located in the west of the Brazilian Amazon. Map algebra was used through the Boolean and fuzzy techniques to create predictability digital models highlighting favorable areas for the occurrence of lateritic crusts. The Index Overlay Method was used in the Boolean technique. The fuzzy technique used the fuzzy algebraic product operator, fuzzy algebraic sum operator, and fuzzy gamma operator. Both models showed good correlation between the favorability predicted and the presence of crusts in the field, however, the fuzzy model showed higher correlation and highlighted areas not identified by the Boolean model. In contrast, the Boolean model allowed the visualization of the areas related to the influence of each variable or its possible combinations individually on the final map. Thus, the identification of lateritic crusts based on mathematic models applied to altimetric and airborne gamma-ray spectrometric data is a new tool that will contribute significantly to geological mapping and to the understanding related to the response and radioelement distribution in weathered materials. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Geomorphology; Lateritic crust; Modeling; Oxisol; Relief","Algebra; Gamma ray spectrometers; Geomorphology; Models; Spectrometry; Spectroscopy; Airborne gamma ray spectrometry; Dismantling products; Fuzzy gamma operators; Geological mapping; Lateritic crusts; Oxisol; Probability of occurrence; Relief; Gamma rays; airborne survey; altimetry; digital terrain model; fuzzy mathematics; gamma ray spectrometry; geological mapping; geomorphology; laterite; map generalization; numerical model; Oxisol; regolith; relief; topography; Amazonia; Brazil"

Although DOM-POM exchange processes have been widely studied from different aspects, little to no effort has been made to date to provide a comprehensive, mechanistic, and micro-spatial schema for understanding various exchange processes occurring in different aquatic ecosystems in a unified way. The phenomena occurring between DOM and POM were explained here with the homogeneous and heterogeneous mechanisms. In the homogeneous mechanism, the participating components are only organic matter (OM) constituents themselves with aggregation and dissolution involved, whereas OM is associated with other components such as minerals and particulate colloids in the heterogeneous counterpart. Besides the generally concerned processes of aggregation/dissolution and adsorption/desorption, other ecological factors such as sunlight and organisms can also participate in DOM-POM exchanges through altering the chemical nature of OM. Despite the limitation of current analytical technologies, many unknown and/or unquantified processes need to be identified to unravel the complicated exchanges of OM between its dissolved and particulate states. Based on the review of several previous mathematical models, we proposed a unified conceptual model to describe all major dynamic exchange mechanisms on the basis of exergy theory. More knowledge of dynamic DOM-POM exchanges is warranted to overcome the potential problems arising from a simple division of OM into dissolved versus particulate states and to further develop more sophisticated mathematic models. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Aggregation; Dissolved organic matter (DOM); Exchange mechanism; Exergy; Particulate organic matter (POM)","Adsorption; Agglomeration; Aquatic organisms; Biochemistry; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Carbon; Dissolution; Dynamics; Ecology; Ecosystems; Exergy; Organic carbon; Organic compounds; Organic minerals; Adsorption/desorption; Analytical technology; Dissolved organic matters; Exchange mechanism; Homogeneous mechanism; Inland aquatic ecosystems; Organic carbon cycling; Particulate organic matters; Aquatic ecosystems; cation; dissolved organic matter; organic matter; particulate organic matter; unclassified drug; adsorption; aggregation; aquatic ecosystem; coastal zone; dissolved organic matter; exergy; inland sea; particulate organic matter; adsorption; alkalinity; aquatic environment; aquatic species; biogeochemical cycle; desorption; dissolution; ecological phenomena and functions; hydrodynamics; inorganic nutrient; light; mathematical model; nonhuman; pH; physical chemistry; priority journal; Review; salinity; sunlight; temperature; water pollutant"

In the recent years, although many scholars researched some control methods such as disturbance rejection control, parameter self-adaptive control, impedance control and so on, to improve the force control performance of HDU, the robustness of the force control still needs improving. Therefore, how to simulate the complex and variable load characteristics of the environment structure and how to ensure HDU having excellent force control performance with the complex and variable load characteristics are key issues to be solved in this paper. The force control system mathematic model of HDU is established by the mechanism modeling method, and the theoretical models of a novel force control compensation method and a load characteristics simulation method under different environment structures are derived, considering the dynamic characteristics of the load stiffness and the load damping under different environment structures. Then, simulation effects of the variable load stiffness and load damping under the step and sinusoidal load force are analyzed experimentally on the HDU force control performance test platform, which provides the foundation for the force control compensation experiment research. In addition, the optimized PID control parameters are designed to make the HDU have better force control performance with suitable load stiffness and load damping, under which the force control compensation method is introduced, and the robustness of the force control system with several constant load characteristics and the variable load characteristics respectively are comparatively analyzed by experiment. The research results indicate that if the load characteristics are known, the force control compensation method presented in this paper has positive compensation effects on the load characteristics variation, i.e., this method decreases the effects of the load characteristics variation on the force control performance and enhances the force control system robustness with the constant PID parameters, thereby, the online PID parameters tuning control method which is complex needs not be adopted.

However, the capability of those models may be limited as they fail to simultaneously consider the redundant information both within the same scale and across multiple scales. Thus, in this paper, an improved SISR reconstruction method is proposed, in which a compensative pair of regularization terms defined by l 1-norm is first constructed by taking advantage of the multiscale self-similarity. Then the calculated sparse coefficients are further aligned to this pair of standards in order to suppress sparse coding noise, and consequently result in more faithful recoveries. Finally, based on conventional iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm, a local-to-global and coarse-to-fine mathematic implementation is established to solve the proposed model effectively.

In this study, we followed the ""second-site suppressor"" strategy to investigate the interaction mechanism of KaiA and KaiC. Using protein sequence analyses, we showed that there exist co-varying residues in the binding interface of KaiA and KaiC. The followed mutagenesis study verified that these residues are important to the functions of KaiA and KaiC, but their roles could not be fully explained by the reported complex structures of KaiA and KaiC derived peptides. Combining our data with previous reports, we suggested a dynamic interaction mechanism in KaiA-KaiC interaction, in which both KaiA and the intrinsically disordered tail of KaiC undergo significant structural changes through conformational selection and induced fit during the binding process.

To apply this method, firstly a non-creep feature space should be generated from all the ultrasonic inspecting signals acquired from no creep specimens; then a residual vector can be calculated by projecting inspecting signal to the non-creep feature space; lastly the deviation ratio can be calculated by dividing the residual vector energy by signal energy. The deviation ratio reflects the distance between inspecting signal and non-creep feature space, higher deviation ratio means worse creep damage in the inspecting target. A general mathematic expression of the non-creep feature space projection method is deduced. For the convenience of signal processing, a simplified linearization algorithm based on blind source separation theory is suggested. To verify this new method, a testing experiment is conducted with P91 steel weldment specimens of different creep status. The results showed that, the new method provides higher sensitivity than usual ultrasonic method. As this method is a relative one, the accuracy of creep evaluation by the method depends on the completeness of non-creep feature space. In addition, as this method is based on evaluating the distance between inspecting target and no-defect feature space, it also can be used for detecting other types of defects. © 2016 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.","Blind source separation; Creep; Ultrasonic; Weld","Algorithms; Blind source separation; Creep; Creep testing; Defects; Inspection; Processing; Signal detection; Signal processing; Steel testing; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonics; Vector spaces; Welding; Creep evaluation; Detection sensitivity; Feature space; Projection method; Residual vectors; Ultrasonic inspecting; Ultrasonic inspections; Ultrasonic methods; Ultrasonic testing"

Due to their degradability, high safety and special nutritious and healthcare function, they are ideal raw materials to prepare edible membranes. NCC boasts the advantages of high crystallinity, high strength, high specific surface area, environmental-friendliness and low cost. Their molecular structure contains a large amount of -OH. When mixed with the other natural macromolecules, they might easily form intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds to contribute to the stability of the structure of blended materials. The NCC adopted by the paper comes from the sunflower seeds hull, a kind of industrial production waste. The CS boasts favorable biocompatibility and biodegradability. Edible membranes with CS as the basic material can effectively prevent the occurrence of food pollution and corrosion, and extend the expiration date of food. SPI is a kind of vegetable protein with rich sources and nutrition and prepared through alkali dissolution acid sedimentation, whose protein content can reach above 90%. Soybean β-conglycinin, 7S, glycinin, and 11S, are its major components. As a highly nutritious plant protein, SPI has a lot of hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds and hydrophobic bonds in its molecular structure, so it has a favorable membrane-forming property. Despite of a strong performance of air resistance, SPI is poor in terms of its mechanical strength. Although there is poor performance for the single membrane-forming component existing in practical applications, the performance of edible membrane can be improved by adding one or multiple natural materials with SPI as the basic membrane-forming material. In order to study edible membrane with a favorable performance and its preparation methods, this paper adopts SPI as the basic membrane-forming material, and adds NCC and CS into the material. The edible membrane is prepared through the alloying-casting-evaporation method. The single-factor experiment is conducted to study the influence of the material ratio, the pH value of membrane-forming materials and the mass concentration of edible membrane on the tensile strength, elongation at break, water vapor permeability and oxygen permeability of edible membrane. The principal component analysis (PCA) and the membership comprehensive rating are combined to work out the comprehensive score of the performance of edible membrane. In the single-factor experiment, the comprehensive score of edible membrane performance is adopted as the response value and various factors as independent variables. The response surface method is employed to optimize the process parameters. The quadratic polynomial mathematic model is built, and the validity of the model and the interaction between various factors are analyzed. Through the analysis of the model, the influence degree of various factors on edible membrane is in the following order: pH value &gt; membrane-forming material ratio &gt; mass concentration of glycerol. The optimal processing conditions for edible membrane are: membrane-forming material ratio is NCC:CS:SPI of 1.25:0.75:2, pH value is 3.59, and mass concentration of glycerol is 0.02 g/mL. Under the optimal conditions, the comprehensive score of the performance of edible membrane is predicted to reach 0.63. Through the verification experiment, the comprehensive rating of the performance of edible membrane is 0.62, the tensile strength was 19.56 MPa, elongation at break was 18.20%,water vapor permeability was 0.73×10-13 g/(cm·s·Pa) and oxygen permeability was 2.21×10-5 cm3/(m2·d·Pa) of edible films. This suggests that the process optimization is scientifically viable, and the infrared and scanning electron microscopic results suggest there is a good compatibility between membrane materials.

Its main objective is to address the lack of basic and complementary knowledge in mathematics. This is considered essential to the integration of students that access higher education to attend undergraduate Engineering degrees. For such, a bi-dimensional structure was implemented, where students can work in person or at a distance, defining educational paths according to the learning outcomes profile of each student. The personalized and responsible support offered in CeAMatE induces self-efficacy behavior, thereby preventing the demotivation of self-study, which usually leads to the abandonment of classes, and consequently causing failure. To this end, the learning objects are organized according to the framework Mathematics for the European Engineer - A Curriculum for the Twenty-First Century, adapted to the Portuguese education. Although the guiding principles that apply to face-to-face program are in general the same as those applicable to the online version, we consider that online systems require special care. The majority of the existing online systems lack interactivity and pedagogy, leading to learning models that depend largely on student motivation. This project has a set of pedagogical concerns that develop around an axis: all the proposed activities adapt to the students cognitive level and their preferred learning profiles. Therefore, the mathematical activities are adapted to the cognitive development of students applying the Bloom Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. Each lesson will also have different versions depending on the specific learning profiles. The principles underlying the construction of CeAMatE can be replicated to other Curricular Units contributing to a change in teaching practices, which are still very based on expositive techniques. This environment will enhance a relevant research work for the redesign and improvement of educational and training projects of higher education institutions providing degree courses in engineering, teaching practices and educational staff training policies. © 2015 IEEE.","Adaptative e-learning systems; Didactic Mathematic; Educational taxonomies; Higher Education; Learning styles","Curricula; E-learning; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Engineering research; Online systems; Personnel training; Taxonomies; Teaching; Bi-dimensional structure; Cognitive development; Didactic Mathematic; Educational objectives; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Learning Style; Undergraduate engineering; Students"

Public utility commissions view energy storage (ES) as a vital yet complementary part of other clean technologies such as renewable generation. As a coherent framework is being mapped out to increase the penetration of renewables in total electricity generation, load serving entities (LSEs) have been encouraged to procure ES systems to hedge against the intermittence and uncertainty of renewable power such as wind. Owing to the increasing penetration of wind generation, it becomes more complex for LSEs to obtain a deterministic ES scheduling decision, i.e. charging/discharging portfolio. To address this challenge, a bi-level strategic scheduling model is proposed in which the primary objective is to maximise the LSE's profit by optimally scheduling ES charging/discharging profile. The sub-problem is Independent System Operator's (ISO's) economic dispatch for generation cost minimisation, assuming foreseeable impact in market-clearing price from ES. This bi-level model is converted to a stochastic mathematic programme with equilibrium constraints by recasting the lower-level problem as its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions.

The method is based on irradiance fluctuation of active light source, but can extract the optical turbulence information in the singlepassage path. In this paper, the theoretical principle of two-aperture differential scintillation method is derived in detail. A concise expression is proposed for irradiance fluctuation structure function with differential aperture in the Rytov approximation under a weak fluctuation regime based on the cross-path theory. The mathematic relationship between irradiance fluctuation structure function and atmospheric optical turbulence strength is then developed. The effects of beacon aperture and beacon altitude on path weighting function of this method are analyzed for Kolmogorov turbulence. In order to test the validity of the new method, the experiments are conducted to compare the twoaperture differential scintillation method and single-aperture scintillation method in atmospheric boundary layer over 2 km horizontal single-passage path. In this arrangement, we employ a differential image motion monitor system to measure differential scintillation. Simultaneously, a large aperture scintillation instrument is placed 5 m away at the same altitude to measure the single-aperture scintillation. It is shown that the results of atmospheric refractive index structure constant deduced from the two methods are in good agreement. The measurements of atmospheric coherence length for spherical wave corresponding to the two methods indicate a linear correction factor (R2) of 0.96, in a slope of 0.98 with an offset of -0.09 cm. Feasibility and effectiveness of two-aperture differential scintillation method are thus verified experimentally. The novel method can separate single-passage scintillation information of active beacon double-passage propagation, thereby providing an accurate technique for measuring the atmospheric turbulence of active beacon. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society.","Atmospheric turbulence; Cross-path theory; Scintillation; Structure function","Atmospheric boundary layer; Atmospheric optics; Atmospheric structure; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layers; Light sources; Light transmission; Motion analysis; Refractive index; Scintillation; Atmospheric coherence length; Atmospheric refractive index; Cross-path theory; Differential aperture; Differential image motion monitors; Fluctuation structures; Kolmogorov turbulence; Structure functions; Atmospheric turbulence"

Guide rail is the carrier of glass lifter, and it bears various load cases when glass lifer works. Mass, stiffness and natural frequencies are the factors that influence the performance of glass lifter. In order to design a lighter and reasonable glass lifter, topology optimization methods are studied in this paper. In a rope-wheel glass lifter, design domain is determined by the mechanical structure and working conditions. Firstly, the single target continuum structure topology optimization mathematic models of guide rail are built in this paper, and analysis of multi-stiffness topology optimization are carried out accordingly in which volume fraction is set as 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6. These models are based on SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) theory. Secondly, multiobjective topology optimization models of guide rail are built to consider the influence of dynamic characteristics, and volume fraction is also set as 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6. These models are based on the weighted compromise programming approach. A new formula is proposed in this paper, and optimization objectives are static stiffness and dynamic frequencies, constraint is volume fraction. Comparing these two methods, single target optimization method is more efficient, whereas the structures of optimized guide rail are not reasonable due to the appearance of a large minimum density area in the middle of guide rail. The topology optimization method of considering dynamic characteristic makes the structures of the optimized guide rail more reasonable. The structural load path is clear, and more triangular structures generate which strengthen stiffness of the structure. In addition, values of optimized compliance are lower than that of the single target topology optimization and the first three order frequencies of multi-objective topology optimization are higher than that of single target. So the topology optimization method of multi-objectives makes guild rail have better rigidity and vibration characteristics, which provides a valuable basis and method for the design of guild rail. © Copyright 2016 SAE International.",,"Glass; Optimization; Rope; Shape optimization; Stiffness; Structural optimization; Topology; Volume fraction; Wheels; Compromise programming; Dynamic characteristics; Mechanical structures; Solid isotropic material with penalizations; Structural load paths; Topology Optimization Method; Triangular structures; Vibration characteristics; Multiobjective optimization"

Harvesting operation is one of the key processes of grain production, and choosing the appropriate harvesting machine is a vital step to reap the grain with larger technology productivity. A lot of researches on agricultural mechanization selection have been done by both domestic and foreign experts. It has been found that there are existing methods for agricultural machine selection such as fuzzy clustering comprehensive evaluation method, linear programming, and mixed integer linear programming. In these methods, the economic performance of the agricultural machinery unit is the objective considered in most cases. But the technical performances of agricultural machinery units, such as the practical productivity, are usually neglected. Plot conditions, including plot area, length, width, and distance between plots, are not considered in the methods, but they are important factors influencing the technology productivity of agricultural machineries. At the same time, it has also been found that the power of most agricultural machineries does not match the plot conditions in the practice of agricultural production. In this paper, the mathematic models calculating every kind of time consumption item during combined operation, including working time, turning time, preparation time before unloading, unloading time, preparation time after unloading and transferring time between plots, were established. On the basis of that, the mathematic models for calculating the combines' technology productivity under the condition of different unloading ways were also set up. These mathematic models contain the variables such as plot area, length, width and distance between plots, and reveal the regularities of technology productivities changing with plot conditions. Experiment was designed according to the method of tracing the practical operating process. Taking 8 kinds of typical combines for harvesting soybean as experiment objectives, the values of all kinds of time consumption items were tested under the condition of fixed distance during the process of normal harvesting operation after enough experiments were executed. All the data of time consumption items were checked using the normal distribution models and the error data were removed according to the 3-Sigma principle. The mathematic models of time consumption items and combine technology productivity established were proved to be correct by the experiments and the actual operating status. According to the models and tested data, the technology productivities of 8 kinds of combine harvesters changing with plot conditions were calculated after the MATLAB program was designed and executed. Curve groups of technology productivity of each kind of combine changing with plot conditions were drew out using the EXCEL. Thus, the quantitative regularity of technology productivity of combine changing with plot conditions was revealed. According to the regularity, the technology productivity became larger as the value of plot area and length became bigger, but the changing velocity of technology productivity became slow after a specific values of plot area and length. The technology productivity of combine with the header width of 2-3 m was higher when the plot area was more than 3 hm2 and the length was more than 400 m. For the combines with the header width of 4-5 m, the technology productivity was higher when the plot area was more than 5 hm2 and the length was more than 600 m. The technology productivity of combine with the header width more than 7 m was higher when the plot area was more than 7 hm2 and the length was more than 800 m. The results of the paper can provide the direct theoretical guidance for practical combine selection under the status of land managing scale with large range, and they are also the improvement and supplement for the theory of agricultural machinery selection. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In this paper, a novel heat recovery exchanger installed on the shell surface is proposed to preheat water. The heat recovery exchanger contains hexagonal water tubes which are easily manufactured and is favorable for saving the cost. A mathematic model is analyzed to determine the shell temperature and heat loss rate along the rotary kilns. Theoretical analyses and experimental measurements are carried out to investigate the temperature and heat transfer rate of heat recovery exchanger, i.e. the design requirements of the heat exchanger. Based on these analyses, an optimization model is put forward to describe the relation between the design requirements and structural parameters of the heat recovery exchanger, i.e. the tube length, the tube numbers and the tube diameter. With the aid of genetic algorithm toolbox in Matlab, the optimized design parameters are obtained. The results show that the optimized heat transfer area is decreased by 30% compare with the value before optimization. What's more, in the cases of different pressure drop, the design parameters of the heat recovery exchanger change while the required heat transfer area remains the same. © 2016, Science Press.

Using the model, the decay process of propagation in the displacement operation can be simulated, providing cartographically pleasing results with respect to the preservation of shape, spatial relations, and patterns of map object (s). However, the model lacks a detailed algorithm for implementation and a feasible method for setting the model's material parameters (i. e. elastic modulus, cross-sectional area, moment of intertia). Therefore, we focuses on the implementation and improvement of the algorithm. First, the basic mathematic model and solution method based on finite element method (FEM) are introduced. Second, from a point view of algorithm implementation, a detailed study of the key issues concerning the calculation and aggregation of the stiffness matrix and force vector are presented. Finally, to reduce the complexity of the parameters, we propose an adaptive parameter setting method to improve the algorithm.

In this article, the effect of MgO-C refractory on the kinetics of spinel transformation was investigated on a laboratorial scale by inserting a MgO-C refractory rod into the Al-killed molten steel. With the refractory/steel reaction time increasing from 1 to 10 minutes, inclusions of Al2O3 gradually degraded into MgO·Al2O3 spinel and the high MgO content inclusion was finally equilibrium with the MgO-C refractory. This interaction process involved Mg supply reactions, Mg transfer in molten steel, and spinel generation reactions. Although MgO-C refractory could supply Mg into the molten steel through MgO reduction reaction both by Al in the melt and by carbon in the refractory, it was found that the Mg mainly came from MgO reduction by the carbon in the refractory. Mg transfer in molten steel was set as the rate controlling step of spinel generation according to theoretical analysis. A mathematic model was developed based on this rate controlling step, and the model calculation agreed well with the experimental results. The Mg diffusion rate was obtained by the regression of the experimental results as 5 × 10−4 m/s. The mechanism of MgO·Al2O3 generation was clarified, and the reaction between dissolved Mg and Al2O3 inclusions occurred first and then the extra dissolved Mg reacted with dissolved Al to generate MgO·Al2O3. © 2015, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.",,"Dissolution; Magnesia; Refractory materials; Slags; Steel foundry practice; Generation reaction; Interaction process; Low oxygen steels; Magnesia-Carbon Refractory; MgO-C refractory; Model calculations; Rate-controlling steps; Reduction reaction; Aluminum"

Based on the principle of material mechanics, a mathematic model is proposed to describe the development of the solidifying shell at meniscus for continuous casting steel slab of low-carbon ([C] = 0.04%) that with the cross-section of 1200 mm × 200 mm. The influence of mechanical stress induced by the mold oscillation on the growth state of meniscus shell and the primary dendrites is evaluated in combination with a non-sinusoidal oscillation mode of mold. The results suggest that the stress caused by the shell bending tends to exceed the critical fracture strength of initial solidifying shell at high temperature. The initial surface crack is formed easily when the upward oscillation velocity of mold exceeds 1.6 m min-1 and is located at 1.9-5.6 mm below meniscus. The subsurface crack is formed when the downward velocity oversteps 6 m min-1 during the negative strip time and is produced in the distance from 3.1 to 4.3 mm below meniscus. The growth direction of primary dendrite changed regularly along with the mold oscillation. The mechanical stress caused by the mold oscillation has a signification effect on the initial cracks formation. The initial surface cracks form easily when the mechanical stress exceeds the critical fracture strength of the initial solidifying shell, and the subsurface cracks have a high possibility to be generated by the regular change of growth direction of the primary dendrites. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Firstly, the measurement method for comprehensive errors of rotary axes was presented based on a standard ball and an on-machine measurement system. The measurement angular positions of the rotation axes were planned by the random Hammersely sequence and the initial position of the standard ball was determined with a free installation strategy. Then, a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network model for predicting comprehensive errors of the rotary axes was built based on subtractive clustering and Fuzzy C-means(FCM) cluster. Finally, mathematical analysis was carried out to provide a new way to model accurately for geometric errors of rotary axes. A cambered measuring example was used to verify the proposed on-machine measurement method and modeling method. The experimental results indicate that the average deviation between the predicted points from the mathematics model and measured points is 9.6 μm and the maximum deviation is not more than 15 μm. After the measuring results are corrected by the mathematic model with a 3D coordinate measuring machine established by this paper, the average value is reduced to 13.6 μm from 33.5 μm and the maximum value is reduced to 18.6 μm from 62.3 μm. It concludes that the measurement method is simple to operate and has high automation.

However, the phenomenon of juicy sac granulation, which causes Citrus quality to decline in the process of postharvest storage, seriously affects the Citrus' edible value and commodity value. Using the technical apparatus for automatic recognition and classification of the Citrus with juicy sac granulation has important practical significance and application potentiality. Low field pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) analysis is a kind of measurement technology that is growing, due to its advantages of nondestructive measurement, rapidity and good consistency. The degree of juicy sac granulation in Citrus is closely related to the existent form and content of water. The present study, using the LF-NMR to evaluate the juicy sac granulation of Citrus, researched the correlativity between LF-NMR intensity of different form of H2O and degree of juicy sac granulation. The degree of juice sac granulation was classified by 9 assessors' sensory evaluation, and validated by the Duncan test and the significance analysis of correlation with physiology indices. These physiology indices including moisture content, lignin content, vitamin C content, weight-loss ratio and respiratory strength, which were significantly correlated to the classification by sensory evaluation of 9 assessors, were analyzed by the correlation significance testing. It was found that the integral values (I21, I22 and I23) of 3 peaks (T21, T22 and T23) on transverse relaxation time (T2) inversion spectrum significantly reflected the juicy sac granulation and were correlated to its degree evaluated by human senses (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). The reason was that the integral values (I21, I22 and I23) of 3 peaks (T21, T22 and T23) on transverse relaxation time (T2) represented the responses of 3 different forms of water (chemically combined water, immobile water and free water) in the Citrus fruit respectively. And by the linear fitting analysis with human's sensory evaluation results, a mathematic model with I21 and I23 as testing indices was established to judge juice sac granulation degree. In present study, 27 Citrus fruits with different juice sac granulation degrees were used to set up the equation for the prediction of Citrus' sac granulation degree, and 8 Citrus fruits were used for the validation of the effectiveness and accuracy of the fitting equation. However, because of its unsatisfying precision, the classification of juice sac granulation was simplified into acceptable or unacceptable on juice sac granulation based on the result of score, which was calculated according to the original fitting equation and the demand of Chinese National Standard. Therefore, the modified method got a good accuracy and practical effectiveness. The paired-samples t-test analysis indicated that there was no significant deference between artificial intelligence evaluation scores and sensory evaluation scores (P=0.4982&lt;t=0.7143). The results show a potentiality for the application of LF-NMR testing in isolating Citrus with low quality in agro-product storage, sale and processing. And authors finally discussed the indices such as water content, lignin content, vitamin C content and respiratory strength involved in the process of juice sac granulation, and assumed that these characteristics may be related to the adverse stress condition and the lignification process of Citrus. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Hence, to ensure network connectivity, each node tends to use the maximum transmission power to extend its transmission range. However, this maximized transmission range typically consumes more energy and consequently drains battery faster on mobile devices in these networks. Topology control is an effective technique proposed in ad hoc networks to ensure network connectivity while reducing energy consumption to prolong operation lifetime. In this work, a novel technique is proposed for an adaptive topology control to allow each node to optimize its transmission range while obtaining the compromising level of network connectivity.

In the numerical simulation model, large deformations and fractures of the soils close to the tubers occurred and small deformations occurred in most parts of the rest. Thus, the coupling method of FEM (finite element method) and SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) was applied in the numerical simulation model. The SPH method was used in inner soil layer where large deformations occurred and the FEM method was used in the outer soil layer where small deformations occurred. The coupling between the inner and outer soil was realized by"" nodes-surface"" in LS-DYNA. And MAT_FHWA_SOIL was selected as soil material model in the numerical simulation model, because it takes account of the influence of moisture content, strain softening, strain rate effect, void ratio, and pore-water pressure, and obeys the modified Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion. Numerical simulation tests of cassava tuber lifting were carried out by using the numerical simulation model and the quadratic regression rotation design method. There were 5 experiment factors and 2 experiment indices in the quadratic regression rotation design tests. The experiment factors were the lifting velocity, the length, dimension and growth depth of the tuber and the soil hardness, respectively. The experiment indices were the maximum lifting force and the maximum stress of tuber which were measured under different factor combination conditions. According to the numerical simulation tests results, the multi-factor coupling mathematic models between the maximum stress of the tuber and the lifting velocity, the length, dimension and growth depth of the tuber and the soil hardness were established by using statistical software SPSS. Based on the coupling mathematic models, the different influencing factors and their interactions on the maximum stress of the tuber were investigated, the relationship curves were drawn by using mathematics software MathCAD, and the corresponding influence laws were obtained by the relationship curves. And based on the numerical simulation tests results, the scatter diagram of the maximum lifting force and the maximum stress of tuber was plotted by using mathematics software MathCAD, and the correlation between them was studied by the scatter diagram. According to the scatter diagram, the allowable maximum lifting force was obtained under which there was no breakage of tuber. Moreover, the allowable maximum lifting force under which there was no breakage of tuber was verified by cassava tuber lifting tests, which were carried out in the cassava planting field in Wuming County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the end of December 2014 by adopting the method of random sampling. Meanwhile, the maximum lifting force and the breakage rate of tuber were analyzed by statistical method. When the allowable maximum lifting force was less than 0.98 kN, the breakage rate of tuber was 2.5%. The result showed that the multi-factor coupling mathematic models between the maximum stress of the tuber and the lifting velocity, the dimension and growing depth of the tuber and the soil hardness had high precision, because the F test of the multi-factor coupling mathematic models was significant at 0.000 1 level. The multi-factor coupling mathematic models could be used in the effect analysis of the maximum stress of tuber. With the increasing of lifting velocity, the maximum stress of tuber increased at first and then decreased. With the increasing of growing depth, tuber length and soil hardness, the maximum stress of tuber increased. But the maximum stress of tuber decreased when tuber's diameter increased. There was little correlation between the maximum stress of tuber and the allowable maximum lifting force. The allowable maximum lifting force was 0.98 kN. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Then, these suspected background wavenumbers are fitted with cubic spline smoothing method.

The temperature inside an SCR catalyst container is important for NOx conversion efficiency and SCR control precision. Accurate prediction for the temperature of the SCR catalyst under the condition of transient loads has important influence on the NOx conversion efficiency. In order to gain the detail of the temperature distribution inside the SCR catalyst container, this work designs 5 test plates with thermocouples which are mounted inside the SCR catalyst container in different places. These 5 test plates contain a serial of thermocouples located in different position to test the temperature distribution inside the SCR catalyst container. These 5 plates are orderly located from the inlet to the outlet of the container, and in each plate, there are totally 17 test points successively along 2 diameters which are respectively the horizontal and vertical directions. During the experiment, the diesel engine with the SCR system is tested under the varied operation engine speeds and loads to supply the SCR catalyst container with exhaust gases of different temperatures and mass flow rates. In addition, a mathematic model is proposed to predict the catalyst temperature at the outlet based on the tested inlet temperature data of the SCR catalyst container. The mathematic model is solved based on a program which is compiled by Matlab/Simulink codes. The experimental results show that under the steady conditions, the temperature inside the SCR catalyst container decreases from the inlet to the outlet of the container along the axial direction. The reason is that as the exhaust gas flows through the SCR catalyst container, the thermal energy of the exhaust gas decreases due to the thermal energy exchanges such as heat convection, heat conduction between the exhaust gas and the catalyst carrier, the container wall, as well as the environmental atmosphere. The experimental results also show that the outlet temperature is lower than the inlet temperature, and the maximum deviation between the tested inlet temperature and outlet temperature is 10.1%. However, the model-predicting outlet temperature has a better deviation of 6.2% with the tested outlet temperature. Under the conditions of transient operation, the downstream temperature of the catalyst container shows a delay of temperature increasing. As the engine speeds and loads change, firstly the inlet temperature rises, but the downstream temperature doesn't increase together with the inlet temperature, and it begins to rise after 40 s. The downstream temperature reaches its 95% of the maximum after nearly 380 s. The reason of this temperature-increasing delay is that the thermal energy transfer from the exhaust gas to the SCR catalyst especially under the transient condition takes much time, and the narrow catalyst holes cause flow resistances to the exhaust gas. This temperature-increasing delay is also demonstrated by the mathematic model. In addition, the model predicts that the outlet temperature under the transient condition has a deviation of less than 6% which is better than the deviation between the tested inlet temperature and the outlet temperature (32%). Therefore, the inlet temperature of the SCR catalyst container is not suitable to be simply adopted as the outlet one for the purpose of the SCR system control strategy, because there is great deviation between the inlet temperature and outlet temperature under both steady and transient operation conditions. In this work, the proposed mathematic model shows good calculation precision when predicting the outlet temperature under both steady and transient operation conditions. Compared with the simple method of adopting the inlet temperature as the outlet one, this model for predicting outlet temperature has better control precision especially under transient conditions, which is good for SCR system control strategy. The control algorithm is applied to the SCR system of a heavy-duty diesel vehicle, and the vehicle is tested based on the ESC (European steady-state cycle) and ETC (European transient cycle) test standards.

Liposarcoma, a type of soft tissue sarcoma in adults, account for approximately 20% of all adult soft tissue sarcomas. There are no effective chemotherapies for majority of these tumors. Efforts made to define the molecular basis of liposarcomas lead to the finding that besides the amplifications of CDK4 and MDM2, Aurora Kinase A, also was shown to be overexpressed. Based on these as well as mathematic modeling, we have carried out a successful preclinical study using CDK4 and IGF1R inhibitors in liposarcoma. MLN8237 has been shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor of Aurora A. MLN-8237, as per our results, induces a differential inhibition of Aurora A and B in a dose dependent manner. At a low nanomolar dose, cellular effects such as induction of phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) mimicked as that of the inhibition of Aurora kinase A followed by apoptosis. However, micromolar dose of MLN-8237 induced polyploidy, a hallmark effect of Aurora B inhibition. The dose dependent selectivity of inhibition was further confirmed by using siRNA specific inhibition of Aurora A and B. This was further tested by time lapse microscopy of GFP-H2B labelled cells treated with MLN-8237. LS141 xenograft model at a dose of 30 mg/kg also showed efficient growth suppression by selective inhibition of Aurora Kinase A. Based on our data, a dose that can target only Aurora A will be more beneficial in tumor suppression.","Apoptosis; Aurora A; Aurora B; Polyploidy; Sarcoma","alisertib; aurora A kinase; aurora B kinase; green fluorescent protein; histone H2B; histone H3; small interfering RNA; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; cell labeling; concentration response; controlled study; dedifferentiated liposarcoma; dose time effect relation; drug effect; drug potency; drug selectivity; drug specificity; drug structure; enzyme inhibition; growth inhibitory concentration; IC50; liposarcoma; liposarcoma cell; LS141 cell line; mouse; nonhuman; polyploidy; protein induction; time-lapse video microscopy; tumor xenograft"

But the popularization and application are limited by the problem of lower upright degree to some certain extent. A new type cam-swing link type transplanting machinewas designed to solve the problem of lower upright degree in current pot seedling planting machine. In addition, the receiving seedling stability of planting apparatus can be guaranteed well, owing to double parallel four-bar mechanism of this planting machine. In this paper, the kinematic model of the transplanting machine was established, including the equations of planting trajectory, planting velocity and planting acceleration for the planting device. For the purpose of high efficiency, interactive GUI design tool had been explored based on the MATLAB/GUI according to these mathematic equations. The influences on the transplanting trajectory of main parameters were analyzed based on MATLAB tool, including the length L1 and original phase angle Φ 1 of crank CD, the length L2 and original phase angle Φ 2 of swing AB, and the length L5 of link AG. The system parameters which had great effects on the planting trajectory were L1, L2, Φ 1 and Φ 2. These parameters were analyzed and optimized through the method of orthogonal experiment. The experimental scheme was designed according to orthogonal table off our factors and three levels. By analyzing the range table of residual, the parameter couldbe ranged as L2, L1, Φ 1 and Φ 2 from big to small, considering the degree of significant on upright degree of seedlings. The optimal combination could be selected that L1 is 118 mm, L2 is 52 mm, Φ 1 is 256°, and Φ 2 is 316°. Under the condition of this optimal combination, the motion model of transplanting machine was reestablished to generate a new optimized planting trajectory. The top of this trajectory was smooth to benefit the receiving seedling stability of planting device. As the total height of this trajectory was about 256 mm with 190 mm higher the ridge side, the planting device couldavoid touching down seedlings planted effectively. When the planting depth reached 60 mm, the maximum residual of curve at planting seedlings parts was 0.465 mm, the mean residual was 0.253 mm, and penetration angel was 81.05°. The simulation results indicated that this optimized planting trajectory can improved the anteversion problem of seedlings that caused by compaction wheel and ensured the seedling planted higher upright degree. In order to verify the reasonability and accuracy of the theoretical model, the prototype was processed with the optimized parameters. Based on the prototype, field tests were carried out according to relevant standards in Yiyang county industrial park of China in March 2015. No crops were planted and the ridge film was mulched in the test plot before the testing, for simply obtaining test results without effects of the other crops. During the course of experiment, 30 horse-power tractor was selected as the only power. The total height of seedlings used was no more than 150 mm, and the height of seedlings substrate less than 60 mm. The plant vertical degree was considered as the main optimization indicator which influenced by the main parameter smentioned above. The data results showed that the mechanism proposed meet the requirements of pot seedling agricultural plant at the speed of 0.556 meter per second, and planting frequency was 60.7 plant percent minute. The qualified rate of upright degree with the variationco efficient of 2.03% was 95%, lodging rate was no more than 1.67%, and plant spacing error rate was only 0.22% with no lacking of seedlings. The results indicated that this machine had the good planting performances of high upright degree and low spacing error rate under the condition of high efficiency of planting.

One of the widely used pre-reconstruction methods for DECT is dual effect decomposition method. But the method only takes the compton scattering and photoelectric effect into consideration and ignores other effects. Thus the dual effect decomposition method has large error and the reconstructed images also suffer from the decomposition error. In this paper, we proposed a new decomposition method for DECT. We use the mathematic method to decompose the linear attenuation coefficient matrix of the chosen materials within a fixed energy range. So we can obtain the basis functions and the material-dependent coefficients. Based on the two material-dependent coefficients, two different types of formula are fitted to calculate the atom number and electron density respectively. This method doesn't rely on any physical model and can decouple the interleaved information of material and energy as precisely as possible.

We then turn to the relations between executive function and achievement. We begin with a review of the larger literature on correlations between the two, both concurrent and predictive. This leads to the fewer but more directly educationally-relevant causal studies.

Mechanical changes to RBCs during storage play an important role in transfusions, and so need to be evaluated pre-transfusion, which demands a convenient and rapid detection method.

The deformability index and the morphology distribution show that the deformability of RBCs decreases significantly with storage time. The normalized curvature, which is defined as the curvature of the cell tail during stretching in flow, suggests that the surface charge of the stored RBCs decreases significantly. According to the mathematic model, which derives from the relation between shear stress and the adherent cells' extension ratio, the Young's moduli of the stored RBCs are also calculated and show significant increase with storage. Therefore, the present method is capable of representing the mechanical properties and can distinguish the mechanical changes of the RBCs during storage. The advantages of this method are the small sample needed, high-throughput, and easy-use, which make it promising for the quality monitoring of RBCs. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Blood; Cells; Cytology; Deformation; Elastic moduli; High speed cameras; Mechanical properties; Microfluidics; Shear flow; Shear stress; Deformability index; High throughput; Mathematic model; Measurements of; Micropipette aspiration; Morphology distributions; Quality monitoring; Rapid detection; Biomechanics"

However, due to customers' versatile electricity consumption patterns under C-DR programs as well as the increasing penetration of wind power generation, obtaining the deterministic bidding decision becomes unprecedented complex for LSEs. To address this challenge, a new strategic bidding model for an LSE is proposed in which the primary objective is to maximize the LSE's profit by providing optimal C-DR considering high wind power penetration. The proposed strategic bidding is a bi-level optimization problem with the LSE's net revenue maximization as the upper level problem and the ISO's economic dispatch (ED) for generation cost minimization as the lower level problem. This bi-level model is converted to a stochastic mathematic program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) by recasting the lower level problem as its Karush-Kuhn-Tucher (KKT) optimality conditions. Then, the stochastic MPEC is transformed to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is solvable using available optimization software, based on strong duality theory.

Methods for minimizing the pressure overshoot amplitude were proposed, such as lowering the discharge equivalent chamber volume of the pump and configuring an adjustable damp hole. The simulation results indicate that the pressure overshoot amplitudes decrease by 48.6% with dual-pressure piston pump (DPP) switching from high operating pressure to low operating pressure and decrease by 20.4% vice versa at one third of the DPP discharge equivalent chamber volume. While the damp hole can effectively suppress the pressure overshoot amplitude with DPP switching from high operating pressure to low operating pressure, and can increase the pressure overshoot amplitude vice versa.

Therefore, it is necessary to make a comparative analysis on larger scales to build a quantitative model with better feasibility and greater accuracy. A total of 225 soil samples were collected in an extensive region of the upper reaches of Heihe river basin. SOC and spectral reflectance were being measured. All the samples were divided into 2 subsets-a modeling subset (180 samples) and a validation subset (45 samples). Six indices were obtained through transformation of soil spectral reflectance (R), continuum-removal (CR), reciprocal (REC), logarithm of reciprocal (LR), first-order differential (FDR) and Kubelka-Munck transformation coefficient (K-M). To build the mathematical model of SOC with 12 spectral indices, two methods, i.e., stepwise linear regression and partial least-square regression were used based on the modeling subset, respectively; the validation subset is used for model evaluation. The results indicated that: (1) Regardless of different modeling methods, model between SOC and LR index was always the best among the 6 reflectance-related indices. LR was the best index for predicting SOC; (2) For the model based on the LR index, the accuracy of model using partial least-square regression method was better than that using stepwise linear regression method; (3)225 samples were compared to verify the former available published SOC model. Both the predicted and measured values passed the mean value t-test, and the Pearson correlation coefficient reached 0.826. It shows that local prediction model can be applied to the research of predicting SOC in the larger scale. © 2016, Peking University Press.

Because of the temperature distribution on the surfaces of heat exchanger, several types of modules are planned for use in an AETEG; however, property disparities among modules exist and wire resistance cannot be neglected in practical application, so experiments have been carried out to research effects of the two factors on the maximum output power of series and parallel connection. The performance of series and parallel connections have been characterized, and mathematic models have been built to analyze and predict the performance of each connection. Experiments and theoretical analysis reveal that parallel connection shows a better performance than series connection when large differences of Seebeck coefficient and resistivity exist. However, wire resistance will cause more significant power dissipation in parallel connection. The authors believe the research presented in this paper is the first to carry out an examination of the impact of module property disparity and wire resistance on the output power of an array of thermoelectric modules connected in series and parallel, which provides a reference for choosing module connection in AETEGs. © 2015, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","module property disparity; performance evaluation; resistivity; Seebeck coefficient; Topological connection; wire resistance","Crashworthiness; Electric conductivity; Electric connectors; Seebeck coefficient; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Topology; Waste heat; Wire; Maximum output power; module property disparity; Parallel connections; performance evaluation; Thermo-electric modules; Thermoelectric generators; Topological connection; Wire resistance; Heat resistance"

Once a failure occurs in the turbo-generator, it not only affects the reliability of the power system but also causes enormous economic losses. Nowadays, large air-cooled turbo-generators have developed. The safe and steady operation of turbo-generator is important for the electric power system. Leakage magnetic field is a potential hazard in end region of a turbo-generator. Leakage magnetic flux could cause eddy current to be induced in the metal component of end region, which leads to heat generation. In this paper, aiming at the complex end structure of turbo-generator, a three dimensional (3-D) mathematic model used for electromagnetic field calculation in end region of a 150-MW air-cooled turbo-generator is established. Finite element method is used to calculate the 3-D magnetic field in end region of a turbo-generator. Magnetic flux leakage testing is conducted under noload condition.

However, analyzing multi-channel EEG signals is a challenging task, which often requires complicated calculations and long execution time. This paper proposes three data selection methods to extract representative data from the EEG signals of alcoholics. The methods are the principal component analysis based on graph entropy (PCA-GE), the channel selection based on graph entropy (GE) difference, and the mathematic combinations channel selection, respectively. For comparison purposes, the selected data from the three methods are then classified by three classifiers: the J48 decision tree, the K-nearest neighbor and the Kstar, separately. The experimental results show that the proposed methods are successful in selecting data without compromising the classification accuracy in discriminating the EEG signals from alcoholics and non-alcoholics. Among them, the proposed PCA-GE method uses only 29.69 % of the whole data and 29.5 % of the computation time but achieves a 94.5 % classification accuracy. The channel selection method based on the GE difference also gains a 91.67 % classification accuracy by using only 29.69 % of the full size of the original data.

The results show that it is scientific and reasonable to use five corrective IFs for journal evaluation for both ophthalmology and mathematics. For ophthalmology, the journal evaluation effects of the five corrective IFs are superior than those of traditional IF: the corrective effect of IFAR/AR is the best, IFAREL/AR is better than IFTotal/Total, followed by IFTotal/AREL, and IFAREL/AREL. For mathematics, the journal evaluation effect of traditional IF is superior than those of the five corrective IFs: the corrective effect of IFTotal/Total is best, IFAREL/AR is better than IFTotal/AREL and IFAREL/AREL, and the corrective effect of IFAR/AR is the worst.

The results calculated by classical diffusion model show that the experimental values of diffusion ratio are greater than the theoretical value before a certain time, however, the former is less than the latter after that time. The classical diffusion model cannot precisely fit a full-time gas diffusion process and the error is large, and then the special phenomenon for diffusion coefficient decrease with the increase of time was found. The new physical model of multi-scale pore distribution in coal was put forward. Based on new model, the authors assumed that the pore distribution within coal is heterogeneous and multi-scale, and has self-similar fractal structure, which causes the multistage distribution of diffusion coefficient within coal and determines the macroscopic diffusion mechanism of gas. From the surface to the center of coal, the pore distributes from big to small and the diffusion coefficient decreases accordingly. Gas diffuses rapidly from the big pore with large diffusion coefficient in the early stage and slowly from the small pore with small diffusion coefficient in the late stage until the micro pore is finally influenced. The multilevel diffusion coefficient distribution caused by multi-size pore results in the diffusion mechanism of diffusion coefficient decease with the increase of time. According to the assumption, two parameters, initial diffusion coefficient (D0) and decay coefficient (β), were introduced to reflect the decay characteristic of dynamic diffusion coefficient. The mathematic model of dynamic diffusion coefficient was put forward. The new model, verified by 200 data, can fit the full-time process of gas diffusion in coal under various conditions. Meanwhile, the new model covers the classical unipore diffusion model and bidisperse one and generalizes the latter ones. The new model can explain the problems caused by classical one, and in terms of accuracy, simplicity, explanatory and predictability, the new model is better than the bi-disperse model and empirical equations. The new model provides a new algorithm to determine coalbed methane content, reserves and outburst predicting index and to explain the diffusion mechanism under various conditions. ©, 2016, China Coal Society.

The goal of the present study was to estimate the number of compartments and the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value with the use of the DWI signal curve. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A useful new mathematic model that includes internal correlation among subcompartments with a distinct number of compartments was proposed. The DWI signal was simulated to estimate the approximate association between the number of subcompartments and the molecular density, with density corresponding to the ratio of the ADC values of the compartments, as determined using the Monte Carlo method. RESULTS. Various factors, such as energy depletion, temperature, intracellular water accumulation, changes in the tortuosity of the extracellular diffusion paths, and changes in cell membrane permeability, have all been implicated as factors contributing to changes in the ADC of water (ADCw); therefore, one may consider them as pseudocompartments in the new model proposed in this study. The lower the coefficient is, the lower the contribution of the compartment to the net signal will be. The results of the simulation indicate that when the number of compartments increases, the signal will become significantly lower, because the gradient factor (i.e., the b value) will increase. In other words, the signal curve is approximately linear at all b values when the number of compartments in which the tissues have been severely damaged is low; however, when the number of compartments is high, the curve will become constant at high b values, and the perfusion parameters will prevail on the diffusion parameters at low b values. Therefore, normal tissues will be investigated when the number of compartments and the ADC values are high and the b values are low, whereas damaged tissues will be evaluated when the number of compartments and the ADC values are low and the b values are high. CONCLUSION. The present study investigates damaged tissues at high b values for which the effect of eddy currents will also be compensated. These b values will probably be used in functional MRI. © 2016 American Roentgen Ray Society.","Apparent Diffusion Coefficient; Compartment; DWI; Gradient Factor; Monte Carlo Method","alteplase; animal experiment; apparent diffusion coefficient; Article; cell compartmentalization; cell membrane permeability; cerebrovascular accident; diagnostic imaging; diffusion coefficient; diffusion weighted imaging; embolism; experimental study; extracellular space; intracellular space; male; mathematical model; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; rat; signal processing; temperature sensitivity; validation process; animal; diffusion weighted imaging; disease model; Monte Carlo method; Stroke; theoretical model; Wistar rat; Animals; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Disease Models, Animal; Male; Models, Theoretical; Monte Carlo Method; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Stroke"

They also revealed wide variation in the time to advance in dilation. An interval of arrest such as 4 hours did not fall beyond normal limits until dilation had reached 6 cm. Thus, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists/Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine first-stage arrest criteria, based in part on these findings, are applicable only in late labor. The wide range of time to dilate is unavoidable because cervical dilation has neither a precise nor direct relationship to time. Newer statistical techniques (multifactorial models) can improve precision by incorporating several factors that are related directly to labor progress. At each examination, the calculations adapt to the mother's current labor conditions. They produce a quantitative assessment that is expressed in percentiles. Low percentiles indicate potentially problematic labor progression.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between first-stage labor progress- and labor-related complications with the use of 2 different assessment methods. The first method was based on arrest of dilation definitions. The other method used percentile rankings of dilation or station based on adaptive multifactorial models.STUDY DESIGN: We included all 4703 cephalic-presenting, term, singleton births with electronic fetal monitoring and cord gases at 2 academic community referral hospitals in 2012 and 2013. We assessed electronic data for route of delivery, all dilation and station examinations, newborn infant status, electronic fetal monitoring tracings, and cord blood gases. The labor-related complication groups included 272 women with cesarean delivery for first-stage arrest, 558 with cesarean delivery for fetal heart rate concerns, 178 with obstetric hemorrhage, and 237 with neonatal depression, which left 3004 women in the spontaneous vaginal birth group. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for each assessment method by measurement of the sensitivity for each complication vs the false-positive rate in the normal reference group.RESULTS: The duration of arrest at ≥6 cm dilation showed poor levels of discrimination for the cesarean delivery interventions (area under the curve, 0.55-0.65; P < .01) and no significant relationship to hemorrhage or neonatal depression. The dilation and station percentiles showed high discrimination for the cesarean delivery-related outcomes (area under the curve, 0.78-0.93; P < .01) and low discrimination for the clinical outcomes of hemorrhage and neonatal depression (area under the curve, 0.58-0.61; P < .01).CONCLUSIONS: Duration of arrest of dilation at ≥6 cm showed little or no discrimination for any of the complications.

They also revealed wide variation in the time to advance in dilation. An interval of arrest such as 4 hours did not fall beyond normal limits until dilation had reached 6 cm. Thus, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists/Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine first-stage arrest criteria, based in part on these findings, are applicable only in late labor. The wide range of time to dilate is unavoidable because cervical dilation has neither a precise nor direct relationship to time. Newer statistical techniques (multifactorial models) can improve precision by incorporating several factors that are related directly to labor progress. At each examination, the calculations adapt to the mother's current labor conditions. They produce a quantitative assessment that is expressed in percentiles. Low percentiles indicate potentially problematic labor progression. Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between first-stage labor progress- and labor-related complications with the use of 2 different assessment methods. The first method was based on arrest of dilation definitions. The other method used percentile rankings of dilation or station based on adaptive multifactorial models. Study Design We included all 4703 cephalic-presenting, term, singleton births with electronic fetal monitoring and cord gases at 2 academic community referral hospitals in 2012 and 2013. We assessed electronic data for route of delivery, all dilation and station examinations, newborn infant status, electronic fetal monitoring tracings, and cord blood gases. The labor-related complication groups included 272 women with cesarean delivery for first-stage arrest, 558 with cesarean delivery for fetal heart rate concerns, 178 with obstetric hemorrhage, and 237 with neonatal depression, which left 3004 women in the spontaneous vaginal birth group. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for each assessment method by measurement of the sensitivity for each complication vs the false-positive rate in the normal reference group. Results The duration of arrest at ≥6 cm dilation showed poor levels of discrimination for the cesarean delivery interventions (area under the curve, 0.55-0.65; P <.01) and no significant relationship to hemorrhage or neonatal depression. The dilation and station percentiles showed high discrimination for the cesarean delivery-related outcomes (area under the curve, 0.78-0.93; P <.01) and low discrimination for the clinical outcomes of hemorrhage and neonatal depression (area under the curve, 0.58-0.61; P <.01). Conclusions Duration of arrest of dilation at ≥6 cm showed little or no discrimination for any of the complications. In comparison, percentile rankings that were based on the adaptive multifactorial models showed much higher discrimination for cesarean delivery interventions and better, but low discrimination for hemorrhage. Adaptive multifactorial models present a different method to assess labor progress. Rather than ""pass/fail"" criteria that are applicable only to dilation in late labor, they produce percentile rankings, assess 2 essential processes for vaginal birth (dilation and descent), and can be applied from 3 cm onward.

In order to optimize and timely replace the lubrication cooling medium, furthermore, to improve the service life of the deep groove ball bearing and the overall performance of RCH, this paper pays attention to the temperature change of deep groove ball bearing. Based on the laboratory test datas, grey neural network was applied to establish mathematic model for predicting the temperature of deep groove ball bearing, and compared with BP neural network. The results show that grey neural network has the advantages of high prediction precision, good stability and less sample data, which has important application value on the temperature prediction of deep groove ball bearing and the design of RCH's cooling lubrication system. © 2016, Journal of Mechanical Strength.

It is also clear that although bodies dimensions can vary in a continuous way, assemblies may experience quite abrupt changes across those states. This paper proposes a new approach to this problem with the goal of being able to predict the mobility class of an assembly of arbitrary complexity, and how it can be affected by a perturbation of the dimensions of its bodies. It does so by proposing a simple and general state transition framework including the three above defined states and seven transitions describing how a dimensional perturbation can affect them. Using this framework, the mobility of a mechanism is easier to capture and predict, using only dimensional (u) and positional (p) parameters involved in an appropriate equation (F(u,p)=0). This is achieved by focusing on how F() behaves when u and p get perturbed, and the impact of this reaction on the mobility state of the assembly. As a result of this more mathematic approach to the problem, previously used notions of iso-constraint, over-constraint and paradoxical assembly, traditionally used to describe such assemblies, can be rigorously defined and thus clarified. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Usually, a biogas-driven CHP is used for both electricity generation and digester heating. However, a huge amount of heat has to be released during the summer in subtropical areas when the heating demand is low. So the tri-generation system, created by enhancing the CHP scheme with an absorption chiller, was proposed to address the defect. In summer, the huge amount of waste heat drives the chiller and produces chilled water for space cooling. Four possible tri-generation retrofitting schemes were proposed with different types of absorption chiller. The hourly dynamic energy performances of the four systems were simulated by the established mathematic models under Hong Kong weather data. Then detailed economic analysis was conducted to the four systems. The results show that the double effect absorption chiller driven by bypass of 450°C flue gas is the optimal retrofitting scheme for its highest thermal efficiency, shortest payback period, better stability and easier control.

Then, when a cloud provider is charging too high for a VM, the proposed system automatically migrates user tasks to a cloud system that is charging at a lower rate. We discuss the architectural framework and platform design, provide a mathematic formulation and investigate a total service fee minimization approach with privacy constraints. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate the proposed system can lower the cost of cloud services by exploiting the advantages of different price policies provided by multiple cloud providers. © 2015 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Cognitive; Inter-Cloud; Pricing; Privacy","Cloud computing; Data privacy; Distributed database systems; Web services; Architectural frameworks; Cloud computing services; Cloud federations; Cloud providers; Cloud service selections; Cognitive; Inter clouds; Privacy constraints; Costs"

In order to reduce heat loss, a practical heat recovery system with nine heat exchangers is proposed to preheat water in this paper. We first propose a mathematic model to analyze the shell temperatures and heat loss rates of several regions on rotary kilns. Integration of theoretical analyses and experimental measurements yields the temperatures and heat transfer rates of heat exchangers, i.e. the design requirements of the nine heat exchangers in the practical system. Secondly, an optimization model is formed to describe the relation between design parameters, i.e. heat transfer area and mass flow rate of each heat exchanger, and system requirements without introducing any intermediate temperatures. With the aid of the Lagrange multiplier method, the optimal design parameters are obtained. Finally, an optimization case of the practical system is studied. The results show that the heat recovery system should meet the requirements of chemical reactions in rotary kilns and mechanical characteristic of shell. The required total heat transfer area of the system after optimization is reduced by 15.6% compared to the value before optimization. As the total mass flow rate increase and inlet temperature decreases, the required heat transfer area decreases while the mass flow distribution ratios remains unchanged. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using appropriate transformations for the velocity and temperature, the basic nonlinear partial differential equations are reduced to the ordinary differential equations. Then, these equations have been solved analytically and numerically for some values of the governing parameters, Reynolds number, Re, channel half angle, α, Prandtl number, Pr, and Eckert number, Ec, using Adomian decomposition method and the Runge-Kutta method with mathematic package. Analytical and numerical results are searched for the skin friction coefficient, Nusselt number and the velocity and temperature profiles. It is found on one hand that the Nusselt number increases as Eckert number or channel half-angle increases, but it decreases as Reynolds number increases. On the other hand, it is also found that the presence of Cu nanoparticles in a water base fluid enhances heat transfer between nonparallel plane walls and in consequence the Nusselt number increases with the increase of nanoparticles volume fraction.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a relative state feedback method and non-linear mapping functions to design a proper control protocol which matches the coarseness of the input set and ensures synchronization. For theoretical analysis, the paper uses an error analysis method and mathematic induction to prove the effectiveness of the designed control protocol. The paper also uses a numerical example to show the correctness of the theoretical results. Findings - The paper provides a method for protocol design when the input set of each agent is imprecise.

In order to improve PS network density, a distributed scatterer (DS) has been utilized in some advanced PSInSAR process, such as SqueeSAR. In addition to the conventional DS that consists of independent small scatterers with a uniform scattering mechanism, processing the DSs dominated by two or more scattering mechanisms is a promising way to improve MP density. Estimating phases from DS with multiple scattering mechanisms is difficult for many DS algorithms because of the interference between different scattering mechanisms. Recently, a covariance-matrix-decomposition-based method, which is named Component extrAction and sElection SAR (CAESAR), is proposed to extract different scattering components from the analysis of the covariance matrix. Instead of using a covariance matrix, the PD-PSInSAR in this study is developed to perform eigendecomposition on a coherence matrix, in order to estimate the phases corresponding to the different scattering mechanisms, and then to implement these estimated phases in a conventional PSInSAR process. The major benefit of using a coherence matrix rather than a covariance matrix is to compensate the amplitude unbalances among SAR images. A detailed study of comparison among SqueeSAR, CAESAR, and PD-PSInSAR is also performed in this study. It has been found that these three methods share very similar mathematic forms with different weight values. The PD-PSInSAR method is implemented to estimate land deformation over the greater Houston area using Envisat ASAR images, which verifies that the proposed method can detect more MPs and provide better coherences. © 2015 IEEE.","Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR); distributed scatterer (DS) interferometry; persistent scatterer (PS) interferometry (PSI); synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Covariance matrix; Estimation; Processing; Synthetic aperture radar; Component extraction; Distributed scatterer; Greater Houston area; Matrix decomposition; Multiple-scattering mechanism; Persistent scatterers; Phase decompositions; Scattering mechanisms; Coherent scattering"

Such a PQ is formulated on the fly in several steps via a set of inter-related step-queries (SQ). In our previous work, we presented a framework to process a restricted type of PQs. However, how to process generic PQs remains an open problem. In this paper, we develop a novel technique to efficiently process generic PQs based on materialized views. The SQs of an in-process PQ can utilize the results of previous SQs not only from the same PQ but also from other in-process and completed PQs. The key idea is to create a multiple query dependency graph (MQDG), which captures the data source dependency relationships among SQs from multiple PQs. A mathematic model is developed to estimate the benefit of keeping the result of an SQ as a materialized view (critical SQ/node) based on the MQDG. The kept materialized views are used to improve the performance of the future SQs. Strategies for constructing the MQDG and identifying the critical SQs for materialization by using the MQDG are presented. To manage the storage of the materialized views, we introduce two approaches – one employs a greedy method and the other adopts a dynamic programming (DP) based method. Strategies are also suggested to reduce the input problem size for the DP procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that our technique is quite promising in efficiently processing PQs. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Database; Materialized view; Progressive query; Query optimization; Query processing","Database systems; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Query languages; Query processing; Database applications; Decision supports; Dependency analysis; Dependency graphs; Materialized view; Multiple queries; Progressive queries; Query optimization; Dynamic programming"

Weighted usable area has been widely used in evaluating the suitability of spawning ground. However, previous studies on the diversity of spawning ground were very rare. To describe the impact caused by the change in river discharge, a concept of microhabitat heterogeneity is presented in this paper based on the habitat heterogeneity in landscape ecology. Water depth and velocity patches were chosen as two major factors in evaluating the heterogeneous level of microhabitat and the Shannon diversity index was adopted as a mathematic principle. A case study of the Fuxing village downstream of the Jinchuan dam on the Dadu River was taken to identify the relationship of microhabitat heterogeneity versus river discharge.

Given its high spatial resolution, spatial positioning accuracy, and efficiency in capturing data of physical surfaces, LiDAR has been influenced by and has significantly changed photogrammetry. The fusion of LiDAR data with aerial images offers various applications, such as DOM generation, virtual reality, city modeling, and military training, because of the complementary nature of the information provided by the two systems. However, the two datasets should be geo-registered into a common coordinate frame prior to such integration, which proves to be quite challenging in terms of either automation or accuracy. Such a challenge may be partly caused by inefficiency in the feature measurement or detection stage. For example, the identification of point of interest or straight line feature is viable and reliable in optical images but is difficult to achieve in LiDAR point clouds because of its poor discontinuity measurements. To this end, an automatic geo-registration approach based on “pin-hole” imaging simulation and iterative gradient mutual information computation is proposed to align single aerial image to discrete LiDAR point clouds. The proposed approach takes photogrammetry collinear equation as strict mathematic mode and involves three stages. First, a virtual “pin-hole” imaging process restored from aerial image orientation parameters is established on urban LiDAR point clouds to generate simulated, gray, LiDAR-depth images. The generated LiDAR-depth images are geometrically similar to aerial images. Hence, difficulties in registration caused by distinct differences in spatial resolution, perspective distortion, and size between the two types of data sources can be greatly alleviated. Second, the geometric transform parameters between LiDAR depth images and aerial images are successfully estimated with the gradient mutual information as the similarity measurement. Moreover, the image pyramid partitioning strategy is implemented to accelerate the search for parameter space. In this stage, LiDAR laser feet points can be roughly mapped on aerial image pixels on the basis of the estimated geometric transform parameters and the known projection relations between LiDAR point clouds and their depth images. Third, the photogrammetry space resection algorithm is implemented using all the mapped aerial image pixels as observed values and their gradient mutual information as weight to improve image orientation parameters. The three stages are repeated until the given iterative calculation condition is met and the LiDAR point clouds are registered with single aerial image. Selected airborne LiDAR data and an aerial image with different initial parameter values are tested with the proposed approach. Approximately 0.5 pixel is obtained, indicating a higher registration precision compared with the ICP algorithm. (1) The “pin-hole” simulation imaging and iterative gradient mutual information calculation successfully resolve the difficult heterologous correspondence problem between LiDAR point clouds and optical aerial images; (2) The photogrammetry space resection algorithm can obtain registration parameters with minimum projection errors and reliable precision evaluation by maximizing the use of intensive space information from LiDAR data and recovering optical bundles of laser beams directly. © 2016, Science Press.

However, this concept has not been fully confirmed owing to the impossibility of tracking down the ancestral somatic cell. We sought to verify the concept by exploring the correlation between cancer risk and mutation accumulation among different tissues. We hypothesized that the detected mutations through bulk tumor sequencing are commonly shared in majority, if not all, of tumor cells and are therefore largely a reflection of the mutations accumulated in the ancestral cell that gives rise to tumor. We collected a comprehensive list of mutation frequencies revealed by bulk tumor sequencing, and investigated its correlation with cancer risk to mirror the correlation between mutation accumulation and cancer risk. This revealed an approximate 1:1 relationship between mutation frequency and cancer risk in 41 different cancer types based on the sequencing data of 5,542 patients. The correlation strongly suggests that variation in cancer risk among tissues is mainly attributable to distinct mutation accumulation rates. Moreover, the correlation establishes a baseline to evaluate the effect of non-mutagenic carcinogens on cancer risk. Finally, our mathematic modeling provides a reasonable explanation to reinforce that cancer risk is predominantly determined by the first rate-limiting mutation.",,"antibody specificity; cell transformation; genetics; human; mutation accumulation; mutation rate; Neoplasms; risk; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mutation Accumulation; Mutation Rate; Neoplasms; Organ Specificity; Risk"

Traditional calculation methods include simplified calculation method and sequence component method. These two only focus on the grounding fault at one of the power towers. Owing to much ignorance, the calculation results are too simplified and not reliable. To solve these problems, this paper discusses the calculation of the grounding fault current distributed on OPGW at any point of the transmission line based on phase component method. The whole line can be divided into different sections by each power tower. Separately, two mathematic modulations are built when the grounding fault at tower and between towers. Numerical examples are applied to verify the correctness of theories of fault at the tower, and then the results are used to verify the correctness of fault between towers, finally applied into an actual project. In the complex overhead transmission system with OPGWs, phase component method proposed can accurately calculate the current distribution with grounding fault at any point of the line. © 2016, Power System Protection and Control Press.

Besides, it can reflect the interaction between various factors, and its analysis of the experimental data is more clear and reasonable. Box-Benhnken Design (BBD) is an experimental design plan commonly adopted by the response surface method. BBD is usually used for the analysis and evaluation of the nonlinearity between three to seven influencing factors and evaluation indexes. It can predict all the major effects and the bidirectional interaction effects. Compared with the orthogonal experiment, it features stronger randomness and complete experimental data. The relationship between the response value and the fitting factors obtained through the latter is also more reliable.

The model for simulating the complex flow is firstly validated by comparing the calculations with the experiments by Hord. Then, the calculated unsteady evolutions of vapor content, temperature and pressure field within the cavity are presented. A special cavitation shedding mechanism, named the partially shedding mode, is revealed for the first time, in which, the primary cavity keeps quasi-steady, while, the much smaller cavity cloud is found to intermittently form near the leading edge inside the primary cavity, then convects downstream along the wall surface and flow out of the closure with a frequency of about 2500 Hz. As the separation of the small cloud from the primary cavity, the volume of the latter diminishes until it is totally swept away with a frequency of about 275 Hz, forming the so called cavitation cloud. The vorticity transport equation in a variable density flow is used to illustrate the complex phenomena of the partially shedding mode. The results reveal that the generation of vorticity mainly happens near the solid surface inside the cavity in non-isothermal cases while it mainly happens at the interface and closure part in isothermal cases. The dynamic interactions between vortices, cavitation and thermal effects are the fundamental cause of the generation of the small bubble clouds, and the three are indispensable. This research helps to understand the complex dynamic mechanism of the cavitation cloud in liquid hydrogen with strong thermal effects. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.","Cavitation; CFD; Liquid hydrogen; Thermodynamic effects; Vorticity","Computational fluid dynamics; Cryogenic liquids; Hydrogen; Isotherms; Large eddy simulation; Liquefied gases; Liquids; Phase interfaces; Unsteady flow; Vortex flow; Vorticity; Dynamic interaction; Homogeneous mixtures; Liquid hydrogens; Shedding mechanisms; Temperature and pressures; Thermodynamic effect; Variable-density flows; Vorticity transport equations; Cavitation"

Methods The design was cross-sectional. A convenient sample of 869 sixth and seventh grade students (12-14 years) was invited to participate in the study. A total of 568 students fulfilled the inclusion criteria and comprised the final sample for this study. Mathematic performance was assessed by a customized test and inhibitory control was assessed by a modified Eriksen flanker task. Physical activity was assessed with GT3X and GT3X+ accelerometers presented in sex-specific quartiles of mean counts per minute and mean minutes per day in moderate-To-vigorous physical activity. Active commuting and sports participation was selfreported. Mixed model regression was applied. Total physical activity level was stratified by bicycling status in order to bypass measurement error subject to the accelerometer. Results Non-cyclists in the 2nd quartile of counts per minute displayed a higher mathematic score, so did cyclists in the 2nd and 3rd quartile of moderate-To-vigorous physical activity relative to the least active quartile. Non-cyclists in the 3rd quartile of counts per minute had an improved reaction time and cyclists in the 2nd quartile of counts per minute and moderateto-vigorous physical activity displayed an improved accuracy, whereas non-cyclists in the 2nd quartile of counts per minute showed an inferior accuracy relative to the least activequartile. Bicycling to school and organized sports participation were positively associated with mathematic performance. Conclusions Sports participation and bicycling were positively associated with mathematic performance. Results regarding objectively measured physical activity were mixed. Although, no linear nor dose-response relationship was observed there was no indication of a higher activity level impairing the scholastic or cognitive performance. © 2016 Domazet et al.

My particular concern is social scientific writing about the crisis that might be grouped loosely under the rubric of ‘performativity’, namely the argument that models (or representations, either mathematic or linguistic) produce markets, and that markets are best studied through ethnographic observation. I ask why language, performance and metaphor itself – what was once the province of a more literary tradition – have become a methodological tool for social scientists now in their particular investigations of finance. I suggest that a more complete analysis of finance may be located if economic performativity and aesthetic theories of performance are brought into dialogue. In part one, I read the ethnographic work of Donald MacKenzie, most centrally, as well as that of Janet Roitman, both of whom have isolated some literary problem of the economy: performativity and narrative, respectively. In the second section, I look at a series of artists and theorists of performance who might be understood to offer a critique of the relationship between language, money and performativity. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","aesthetics; crisis; finance; Marxism; performativity",

The eddy current retarder (ECR) has a good braking performance, but the braking torque would fade under high speed domain. In the contrary, the regenerative brake (RGB) could provide a satisfied braking performance in high speed domain. However, the braking torque in low speed domain is insufficient. This paper proposed a novel concept of the integrated energy-recuperation retarder (IEER), which would take advantage of the merits of both the ECR and the RGB to have a steady braking performance in all-speed domain. The IEER integrates the structures of rotary eddy current retarder (RECR) and the RGB, both of which share a stator. Braking torque of the IEER produced by stator core and armature-windings can stack together, and therefore the IEER can provide greater braking torque than the RECR. Besides, the IEER can recover electric energy from armature-windings. The IEER can weaken the recession of braking torque effectively, and possess a high electric energy-recovery power in theory. This paper aims at the matching of the braking torque and the electric energy-recovery power. Firstly, the braking torque's mathematic models of the IEER and the RECR are derivate respectively, and the electric energy-recovery power's mathematic models of the IEER and the RGB are also established respectively. Then, the simulation tests based on MATLAB/SIMULINK are set up considering the variables of the rotating speed, and the finite element method is applied in Ansoft Maxwell considering the Inhomogeneous magnetic field in the IEER. Finally, braking torque's property of the IEER and the RECR, and electric energy-recovery power's property of the IEER and the RGB come out. The simulation results reveal the obviously smaller recession of the braking torque compared with the RECR, while the electric energy-recovery power is nearly identical to the RGB.

Methodology: Mainly, the theoretical research methods which include the determination of the elastic system stiffness matrix of the machine and the manipulator were applied. Circuit and structural solutions of mobile multicoordinate robotic machine were theoretically grounded. Mathematic simulation of the object processing with the mobile robotic machine was conducted. On the basis of the mathematic simulation analysis, the peculiarities of deformation characteristics of machine were defined through the determined stiffness matrices. Findings: The concept of precision machining of objects in the field conditions with a mobile robotic machine was substantiated. It is based on the application of equipment with low stiffness in conjunction with a special manipulator, which is tightly linked to the object and provides the necessary movement of a tool. The circuit of the precision machining of objects with mobile robotic machine was grounded. This circuit fulfills the use of two dual mechanisms-hexapods, one of which is the pivotal system of the machine and the other is the system of manipulator. The means of machine working space increase by means of telescopic rods of the variable length with the pneumatic drives were suggested. Conditions for the improvement of the accuracy of the robotic machine during the process of machining with a rotary cutting tool were determined. They include accordance of the main axes of the manipulator stiffness matrix and the movement direction of the rotary cutting tool. The type and nature of the machining faults and their interrelation with the parameters of the machine stiffness and the manipulator stiffness were determined. originality: For the first time the concept of precision machining with robotic machines that have low stiffness of the carrying system is developed. The concept consists in the application of the manipulator that is rigidly fixed to the processed object and associated with the final controlling element of the machine. The component of stiffness matrix of the machine and the manipulator are brought into proper correlation, which provides the possibility of precision machining with mobile robotic machines.

To meet the crashworthiness performances, two evaluation indexes are defined to convert the practical engineering problems into mathematic optimization problems. The strain energy is treated as the stiffness evaluation index of the BIW and the relative displacement is employed as the compliance index of the components and parts. The optimization problem could be changed into maximizing structural stiffness of the design space while constraining the relative displacements of the passenger cabin lower than a certain value to guarantee the stiffness of passenger cabin, constraining the relative displacements of the front and rear cabin greater than a certain value to increase the energy absorption during the crash process. The results provide a conceptual design which emphasizes the most efficient load paths and could be served as an effective guidance to the next-step BIW detailed design.

Dynamic interaction between centrifuge shaker and bucket is inevitably generated as a crucial issue for centrifugal shaker development, especially large scale. Based on the robust control strategy and general design of 1-D centrifugal shaker, an equivalent mathematic model for centrifugal shakers was developed and the corresponding transfer function was derived for analyzing the dynamic interaction of centrifugal shaker and bucket. A series of numerical analysis using the transfer function was performed to understand the influence of main parameters of bucket on the performance of centrifugal shaker through the dynamic interaction. A visible oscillation was observed around the first modal frequency of bucket. The results show that increases in the mass ratio or damping ratio of bucket are effective means to mitigate the oscillation, and the recommended parameter values are 4 and 0.1, respectively.

However, there is little information on the GS content, colour, and texture attributes in Brassica vegetables in relation to the duration of steaming. This study investigated the effect of the duration of steaming, which was applied in certain commercial preparation processes, on the GS content, colour, and texture of white cabbage. Results showed that the total accessible content of GSs increases initially during steaming until 10 min followed by a consistent decline up to 180 min. This observed initial increase is mainly due to the content of aliphatic GSs rather than indole GSs, which tend to decrease from the start of steaming. A mathematic model for the observed behaviour of the GSs, taking into account several mechanisms, is proposed and fitted to the data. The intensity of the green colour of the cabbage slightly increased during the first 15 min of steaming followed by a decrease onwards. The hardness showed a continuous decline during the entire steaming duration. The study indicates that steaming up to 10 min could promote the health properties as well as the colour and texture attributes of steamed cabbage. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cabbage; Glucosinolate; Modelling; Steaming","Models; Thermal processing (foods); Vegetables; Brassica vegetables; Cabbage; Glucosinolates; Mathematic model; Phytochemical; Preparation process; Steaming; White cabbage; Color"

According to the mathematic model, the force of fifteen subjects (including seven females and eight males) on the same mattress and human anthropometrical measurement, the actual weight of each body segment could be calculated. The error analyzing shows that the mean relative error of the measurement results of three somatotypes was 2.4%.

The ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N) from crop leaves, defined as ratio of LCC (leaf carbon concentration) to LNC (leaf nitrogen concentration), is an important index that can be used to diagnose the balance between carbon and nitrogen, nutrient status, growth vigor and disease resistance in crop plants. Thus, it is very significant for effectively evaluating crop growth in field to monitor changes of leaf C/N quickly and accurately. In this study, some typical indices aimed at N estimation and chlorophyll evaluation were tested to assess leaf C/N in winter wheat and spring barley. The multi-Temporal hyperspectral measurements from the flag-leaf, anthesis, filling, and milk-ripe stages were used to extract these selected spectral indices to estimate leaf C/N in wheat and barley. The analyses showed that some tested indices such as MTCI, MCARI/OSAVI2, and R-M had the better performance of assessing C/N for both of crops. Besides, a mathematic algorithm, Branch-And-Bound (BB) method was coupled with the spectral indices to assess leaf C/N in wheat and barley, and yielded the R2 values of 0.795 for winter wheat, R2 of 0.727 for spring barley, 0.788 for both crops combined. It demonstrates that using hyperspectral data has a good potential for remote assessment of leaf C/N in crops. © 2016 SPIE.","Branch-And-bound method; Leaf C/N; Spectral index; Spring barley; Winter wheat","Agriculture; Crops; Cultivation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Estimation; Hydrology; Nitrogen; Optical waveguides; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Carbon and nitrogen; Carbon concentrations; Disease resistance; Hyperspectral measurements; Leaf C/N; Mathematic algorithms; Spectral indices; Winter wheat; Branch and bound method"

There is an unsolved key technology that how to obtain precise navigation information of the probe autonomously. Because of the effect of error accumulation, inertial navigation technology can't be adopted as the main navigation method for deep space probe, which maybe cruise in space several decades. Fully autonomous and higher accuracy are the characters of Pulsar Navigation (PN) technology, which make PN become one of the most potential navigation technology. PN has attracted many research works. But the X-ray energy emitted by pulsars for navigation is weakly, it is very difficult to develop the enough sensitive sensors for pulsar navigation. At present, a feasible schematic of sensor could receive the signals from 1~2 pulsars, and geometric position method could not be used. We can only use dynamic orbit determination method, while the observability of navigation system is worse. In order to improve the accuracy and the convergence rate of the dynamic orbit determination method which only adopt the observation of pulsars, we introduce the optical observation of vicinity celestial bodies, such as Mars, Jupiter and so on, when the probe cruises close to them. In this paper, we analyze the observability of vicinity celestial bodies firstly, and then establish the whole navigation algorithm in details., The obervability of the hybrid navigation system could be enhanced much more by introducing the optical observation of vicinity celestial bodies. The results of mathematic simulation shows that, the convergence time of the navigation algorithm could be reduced from several hours in one hour, and the accuracy of navigation could be improved from tens of kilometers to several kilometer, by adopting optical and pulsar hybrid autonomous navigation method.","Autonomous optical navigation; Obervability; Pulsar navigation","Air navigation; Earth (planet); Navigation systems; Observability; Orbits; Probes; Space probes; Autonomous navigation; Autonomous optical navigation; Mathematic simulations; Navigation algorithms; Navigation in formation; Navigation technology; Obervability; Pulsar navigations; Pulsars"

The model comprises the steps for identifying and extracting the required data, as well as a mathematic model to predict the energy consumption on both the infrastructure and the service level. Using the example of a distributed and shared ERP system, in which services are represented by ERP transactions, we evaluate the procedure model within a controlled experiment. The model was trained on monitoring data, gathered by performing a benchmark, which triggered more than 1,116,000 dialog steps, initiated by 6000 simulated SAP ERP users. During the benchmark, we monitored the dedicated resource usage for each transaction in terms of CPU time, database request time and database calls as well as the energy consumption of all servers involved in completing the transactions. Our developed procedure model enables IT service providers and business process outsourcers to assign their monitored hardware energy consumption to the actual consuming ERP transactions like creating sales orders, changing outbound deliveries or creating billing documents in watt per hour. The resulting dedicated energy costs can be transferred directly to overlying IT products or to individual organizations that share a multitenant ERP system. The research is mainly relevant for practitioners, especially for internal and external IT service providers. Our results serve as an early contribution to a paradigm shift in the granularity of energy monitoring, which needs to be carried forward to comply with an integrated and product-oriented information management and the ongoing extensive use of cloud- and IT service offerings in business departments.

Unlike for conventional oils, where the expected recovery from such reservoirs could be very high - in excess of 50 percent, the expected recovery factor in heavy oil water-driven reservoirs is less than 20 percent. In this study, a qualitative analysis of the well productivity mechanisms specific for heavy oil reservoirs with bottom water is provided. The objective is to understand what make the production of heavy oil different to that of lighter oils, identify the mechanism that mostly hamper the well's productivity and recovery efficiency. Many believe the by-passed oil due to water coning is the major cause of low ultimate oil recovery in heavy oils underlain by strong bottom water. However, in this paper, we identify another important parameter affecting recovery efficiency in such reservoirs, which hasn't been recognized by others and its effect on recovery process is significant. The mathematic modeling and numerical study lead to a new finding: due to the aquifer's influence on pressure response in reservoir, a no-flow boundary at xi is established, where xi is often much smaller than that of the actual reservoir size xe. The oil out to the distance xi is immobile and become bypassed oil, which accounts for large amount of the OOIP. Even the water coning can be effective controlled; the ultimate oil recovery factor will not be improved significantly if the small mobilized oil zone can't be enlarged. An analytical solution is derived in this paper to calculate the actual drainage radius. The validity of this analytical solution is confirmed by numerical simulation runs.

Findings indicated that the complexity level correlated with the difficulty coefficient for only one of three semesters. In addition, the correlation between the discrimination coefficient and the difficulty coefficient was found to be statistically significant in all three semesters.

We explored the phase behavior of lyotropic liquid crystalline (LLC) mesophases composed by monoolein/oleic acid/water for enhanced administration of donepezil. Polarized light microscopy suggested that these systems ranged from isotropic inverse micellar solutions (L2) to viscous and birefringent reverse hexagonal (HII) mesophases according to the amount of water in the ternary systems. Phase transition was observed from a L2 phase to HII mesophase after swelling studies, an interesting property to be explored as a precursor of LLC mesophases for mucosal administration that increases its viscosity in situ. Mucoadhesive properties of LLC mesophases were characterized using a texture analyzer indicating that these systems can have an increased residence time in the site of absorption. Donepezil-free base was incorporated in the evaluated formulations, and their in vitro release was controlled up to 24 h. The phase behavior of the systems demonstrated a great potential for enhanced donepezil administration once these mucoadhesive-controlled release formulations can incorporate the drug and prolong its release, possibly reducing its side effects. © 2016 American Pharmacists Association®.","biomaterials; controlled release/delivery; lipids; mathematic model; microemulsion; mucosal drug delivery; oral drug delivery; transition","chloride; donepezil; glycerol oleate; oleic acid; water; acylglycerol; cholinesterase inhibitor; delayed release formulation; donepezil; drug carrier; glycerol oleate; indan derivative; nanomaterial; oleic acid; piperidine derivative; water; Alzheimer disease; Article; birefringence; chemical composition; controlled release formulation; controlled study; drug release; drug solubility; high performance liquid chromatography; in vitro study; liquid crystal; lyotropic liquid crystalline mesophase; mean residence time; micelle; mucoadhesion; phase transition; polarization microscopy; preformulation; surface property; wettability; adhesion; Alzheimer disease; animal; chemistry; delayed release formulation; human; intestine mucosa; medicinal chemistry; pig; solubility; theoretical model; Adhesiveness; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Delayed-Action Preparations; Drug Carriers; Drug Liberation; Glycerides; Humans; In Vitro Techniques; Indans; Intestinal Mucosa; Models, Theoretical; Nanostructures; Oleic Acid; Phase Transition; Piperidines; Solubility; Swine; Water"

Arithmetic problems were presented in two different conditions: preceded by a semantic judgment or without additional language context. In the French session we observed that additions were systematically performed faster in the condition with an additional language context.

Optimal determination of innovative production distribution expenses is top-priority element to increase economic subject's activity profitability and to increase its competitive positions at the market. Thus, planning of costs for innovatively active machine building enterprises sales has to be based on economic and rationally adaptive mathematic tools to industrial enterprises activity specific. Practical implementation of the mentioned task is possible owing to economic and mathematic model to plan costs for innovatively active enterprises production, which preconditions urgency of the given research. Besides the tools investigation is also urgent and it allows to foresee future expenses amounts for sales, demand for production and profit of the innovatively active industrial enterprise, behavior in future depending on market situation. The article deals with scientific and methodic approach to optimize distribution expenses of the innovatively active industrial enterprises in Ukraine. Economic and mathematic modeling methods allowed to formalize models to plan distribution expenses of innovatively active enterprise, demand and profits, that is prerequisite to form prognostications by proper directions. Practical implementation of the suggested scientific and methodic approach on the example of machine building enterprise in Ukraine results in confirmation of models correspondence and establishment of inefficiency to distinguish expenses. It gives evidence about necessity to optimize expenses of enterprise and to introduce active managerial decisions concerning its activity profitability growth. © Oleg Olefirenko, 2015.","Costs for innovations; Enterprise; Enterprise incomes; Innovations; Investments; Machine building industry; Optimization; Prognostication; Sales",

Authoring tools of e-learning systems typically do not directly support the rendering of mathe-matic equations. Teachers are therefore required to find and install additional plugins. Visual elements such as plots, drawings or diagrams have to be created using external tools. Exercise questions and student responses are mostly restricted to simple multiple-choice or fixed answer questions, since common e-learning systems are not able to process mathematic expressions. With MathAuthor we propose an authoring environment tailored to the specific needs of math educators. Math-Author allows teachers to quickly create interactive exercises with various types of mathematic responses (e.g. functions, solution sets etc.). Its web-based editing functionality allows a real-time preview of all created content elements including equations and interactive input fields. MathAuthor also proposes a language for describing mathematic plots and 3D drawings, allowing teachers to easily embed graphics (e.g. function curves or vector geometry drawings). MathAuthor can provide immediate feedback to student responses. This feedback is generated purely in Javascript, thus requiring no special server component. As a consequence, it is easy to integrate the resulting exercise sheets into existing websites and e-learning systems. Copyright © 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Optimal replenishment lot size and optimal total cost per unit of time yielded from these models with different interpolating conditions are compared with similar quantities provided by classical EOQ model. Second, we discuss another model which allows both stock dependent demand rate and holding cost, which also allows deteriorating items under inventory to accept.

The prevailing amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that amyloid-β (Aβ) elevation induces downstream Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal loss that ultimately results in cognitive impairment. Alternatively, the dual-pathway hypothesis suggests that Aβ and abnormal Tau are two independent factors that exert synergistic effects on synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. We hypothesize that the intrinsic interaction of Aβ and Tau would better predict cognitive impairment.

Analysis was conducted on the vibration response of the existing tunnel to adjacent blasting construction. Accordingly, we obtained the vibration velocity point layout scheme and the corresponding explosive loading optimization scheme: measurement points for the existing tunnel should be distributed over the middle-top front straight wall. The measurement point of fastest vibration is 4m before the tunnel face counterpart. Key monitoring should be done on the interval of -4m-10m from the tunnel face. By comparing the numerical simulation result with the measured data, we conclude that the measured peak vibration velocity and the numerical results basically share the same change trend. Proper control over explosive loading is crucial to diminishing blasting-induced vibration response and realizing normal operation of existing tunnels.

Moreover, both of the time delays that are induced by avionic-bus and system uncertainties are considered to be described as mathematic parameters in complete fault model. By employing multiple parameter-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions, sufficient stability conditions of uncertain networked flight control systems with actuator faults are derived, and robust fault mode depended controllers are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which is capable of accommodating uncertainties in the presence of actuator faults.

Besides presenting fuzzy models, this paper reveals the problem of reliability of the fuzzy model results. Solving this problem depends on the investor’s attitude to the model results.

The researchers found that superbugs with new type of resistance genes (NDM-1) have two aspects of transmission characteristics; the first is that the antibiotic resistance genes can horizontally transfer among bacteria, and the other is that the superbugs can spread between humans through direct contact. Based on these two transmission mechanisms, we study the dynamics of population in hospital environment where superbugs exist. In this paper, we build three mathematic models to illustrate the dynamics of patients with bacterial resistance in hospital environment.

The eddy current retarder (ECR) has a good braking performance, but the braking torque would fade under high speed domain. In the contrary, the regenerative brake (RGB) could provide a satisfied braking performance in high speed domain. However, the braking torque in low speed domain is insufficient. This paper proposed a novel concept of the integrated energy-recuperation retarder (IEER), which would take advantage of the merits of both the ECR and the RGB to have a steady braking performance in all-speed domain. The IEER integrates the structures of rotary eddy current retarder (RECR) and the RGB, both of which share a stator. Braking torque of the IEER produced by stator core and armature-windings can stack together, and therefore the IEER can provide greater braking torque than the RECR. Besides, the IEER can recover electric energy from armature-windings. The IEER can weaken the recession of braking torque effectively, and possess a high electric energy-recovery power in theory. This paper aims at the matching of the braking torque and the electric energy-recovery power. Firstly, the braking torque's mathematic models of the IEER and the RECR are derivate respectively, and the electric energy-recovery power's mathematic models of the IEER and the RGB are also established respectively. Then, the simulation tests based on MATLAB/SIMULINK are set up considering the variables of the rotating speed, and the finite element method is applied in Ansoft Maxwell considering the Inhomogeneous magnetic field in the IEER. Finally, braking torque's property of the IEER and the RECR, and electric energy-recovery power's property of the IEER and the RGB come out. The simulation results reveal the obviously smaller recession of the braking torque compared with the RECR, while the electric energy-recovery power is nearly identical to the RGB.

First, two constraints functions are proposed, which are unit reliability constraint function and system reliability constraint function, respectively. The unit reliability constraint function consists of allocated reliability index of unit and the range of reliability index for unit. And the system reliability constraint function consists of the target reliability index of system, and the predicted reliability index of system obtained by using GO method and allocated reliability index of unit. Then, the objective function of optimization allocation problem is established to describe the system cost minimization taking into consideration costs of unit redesigned and unit selected versions. Based on above, the mathematic model of reliability optimization allocation problem for complex multifunction systems is established. In addition, an improved genetic algorithm is presented to solve this mathematic model. Furthermore, the process of the new reliability optimization allocation method for complex multifunction systems is formulated. Finally, the new method is applied in reliability optimization allocation of Power-shift Steering Transmission whose goal is to minimize the system cost. The results analysis shows that the system costs for different operation times turn to a relatively stable value, and the allocated reliability indexes of unit are satisfied with engineering requirements. All in all, this new optimization allocation method can not only obtain the reasonable allocation results quickly and effectively, but it also can overcome the disadvantages of existing reliability optimization allocation methods for complex multifunction systems efficiently. In addition, the analysis process shows that the reliability optimization allocation method based on GO method can provide a new approach for the reliability optimization allocation of multifunction systems.

Moreover, the circulating currents are usually affected by the output filters (OF) of each module due to their filter and resonance properties. The interaction among the circulating currents in the modules increase the power loss and reduce system stability and control precision. Therefore, this paper reports the results of a study on the SPWM high-frequency harmonics circulating currents for a double-module VSI. In the paper, an analysis of the circulating-current circuits is briefly described. Next, a mathematic model of the single-module output voltage based on the carrier frequency of SPWM is built. On this basis, through mathematic modeling of high-frequency harmonic circulating currents, the formation mechanism and distribution characteristics of circular currents and their influences are studied in detail. Finally, the influences of the OF on the circulating currents are studied by mainly taking an LC-type filter as an example. A theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate some important characteristics. First, the carrier phase shifting of the SPWM for each module is the major cause of the SPWM harmonic circulating currents, and the circulating currents are in an odd distribution around n-times the carrier frequency nωs, where n = 1, 2, 3, …. Second, the harmonic circular currents do not flow into the parallel system. Third, the OF can effectively suppress the non-circulating part of the high-frequency harmonic currents but is ineffective for the circulation part, and actually reduces system stability. © 2016 KIPE.","High-frequency harmonic circulating currents; Modular inverters; Output filter; SPWM","Electric inverters; Phase shift; Superconducting materials; System stability; Carrier phase shifting; Circulating current; Detection and controls; Distribution characteristics; High frequency harmonic currents; High-frequency harmonics; Output filters; SPWM; Harmonic analysis"

The reflectance spectra obtained from the polished samples with different oxidation (and colour) degrees were used to calculate the real part of the refraction index and the (imaginary) extinction coefficients of both the metallic substrate (n2, k2) and the magnetite layer (n1=2.42, k1). The a+bλ+cλ2 form was taken adjusting parameters between experimental and theoretical curves. The fitting of the data resulted in deviations between 2 and 10% for thicknesses in the range of 0 nm (only substrate) and 65 nm (dark blue colour). By means of a mathematic model and following the Heavens' theory, the thickness of each layer has been predicted with high precision, using the spectral reflectance. Consequently, we propose that by using this methodology, the values of the extinction coefficients of the oxide species can be easily obtained, and the thicknesses of the oxide layers can be predicted. The magnetite thickness values found in this study fall into the interval reported in the literature for first-order interference in steels, from light-yellow (~46 nm) to blue (~72 nm).","Colour theory; Coloured gold alloys; Magnetite; Oxide layer",

The orthogonal experiments results show that the influence laws of processing parameters on surface roughness are the same, and the values of surface roughness obtained by UDR-LTV are smaller than that of CDR with the same processing parameters. The values of surface roughness obtained by UDR-LTV and CDR increase and then decrease with the increment of the static pressure; and increase with the increment of the feed-rate, and change a little along with the increment of the rolling speed. Meanwhile, the feed-rate has a marked effect on the surface roughness, while the rolling speed has a little effect on the surface roughness. The quadratic regression method is used to construct the mathematic model to predict surface roughness based on the experimental results. The effects of parameter interactions on surface roughness are studied. The research shows that the interaction effects of the rolling speed and the feed-rate, the static pressure and the feed-rate on surface roughness are obvious, but the interaction effect of the static pressure and the rolling speed on surface roughness is not significant.

Prior research has shown that spatial abilities can be trained; that’s why in this work we propose several kinds of short duration trainings aimed to improve those abilities. We have established a ranking based on the improvement rate that the student may reach knowing his starting level before undertaking training. These trainings take place before starting the academic course so students don’t receive theoretical or practical contents of Graphic Engineering during the week. Before training and after its completion, the level of spatial ability is measured through validated tools for this aim. We perform a statistical analysis obtaining the gains from higher to lower levels of spatial skills acquired through trainings (videogame/augmented reality/sketching/descriptive geometry).

Due to the complex configuration in layout space with numerous pipelines, diverse design constraints, and obstacles, it is a complicated and time-consuming process to obtain the optimal route of ship pipes. In this article, an optimized design method for branch pipe routing is proposed to improve design efficiency and to reduce human errors. By simplifying equipment and ship hull models and dividing workspace into three-dimensional grid cells, the mathematic model of layout space is constructed. Based on the proposed concept of pipe grading method, the optimization model of pipe routing is established. Then an optimization procedure is presented to deal with pipe route planning problem by combining maze algorithm (MA), nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), and cooperative coevolutionary nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (CCNSGA-II). To improve the performance in genetic algorithm procedure, a fixed-length encoding method is presented based on improved maze algorithm and adaptive region strategy.

Simple and scale indices provided by the PISA database, constructed by responses from the students’ and principals’ background questionnaires, were considered as predictive variables of the math achievement scores. Multilevel models including all the predictive variables, controlling for some relevant student, family background and school variables, confirmed that perceptions of school and classroom climate and teachers’ behavior influence mathematics performance in PISA. In particular, the effect of the teacher’s use of cognitive activation strategies had the strongest positive effect, followed by the school and classroom climate indicators. Thus, more cognitively activating instruction and an orderly and peaceful atmosphere in schools and classrooms encourage students and help to transform existing interests into mathematic achievement. Our analyses show that these factors can also influence the gap between Northern and Southern Italian macro-areas. When the predictive variables are added to the control variables in our multilevel models including macro-area indicators, the gap between Northern macro-areas and the Southern-Islands decreases by over twenty per cent, and the gap between Northern macro-areas and the Southern by over fourteen per cent.

Assessment of the effect of undermining on rock mass deformation involved mathematic modeling of rock mass behavior in the course of mining with one, two and three stoping horizons. The modeling and auxiliary research have recovered complete deformation pattern in rock mass, and it has been recommended to adjust the method of mining as a result and to change from the bottom-up to the top-down sequence.

The sample group comprised 249 children aged 14-17 years from about 50 Russian schools. The group was divided into two subgroups: 1) 132 adolescents, 81 girls and 51 boys, with high general IQ (hereafter - gifted); 2) 117 teenagers, 66 girls and 51 boys, with average IQ. Scores of 11 intellectual abilities were measured by the Universal Test of Intelligence Investigation ""UIT"". The program SPSS Statistics 20 was applied for processing mathematical data. The main results are that only adolescents with high IQ show the sexual dimorphism of intellectual abilities: girls have better results than boys at verbal (p=0.001), spatial abilities (p=0.05), short-term memory (p=0.001); boys have better results at mathematic abilities (p=0.001). Adolescents with average IQ didn't show sex diff erences in the level of cognitive abilities. This fact allows to suggest that the level of IQ is an important factor for prediction sex diff erences in a cognitive development. The gifted girls show higher spatial abilities than boys (it is unusual among diff erent researches of this topic). One of the factors of giftedness is the increased level of testosterone in the early stage. Testosterone for women has positive correlation with the level of spatial abilities, men have negative correlation. The sex diff erences caused by high testosterone can explain the higher scores for gifted girls.","Adolescents; High intelligence; Intellectual abilities; Intellectual giftedness; IQ; Sex diff erences; Sexual dimorphism; Spatial cognitive abilities",

We simulated several common ion channels in neuron membranes based on data from rat dorsal root ganglion cells and modeled the action potential. The ion channel models employed in this paper were based on the Markov model. After modifying and calibrating these models, we compared the simulated action potential curves under the presence and absence of an HCN channel and calculated that the proportional contribution of the HCN channel in the potential recovery phase was 33.39%. This result indicates that the HCN channel is critical in assisting membrane potential recovery from a hyperpolarized state to a resting state. Furthermore, we showed how the HCN channel modifies the firing of the action potential using mathematic modeling. Our results indicated that although the loss of the HCN channel made recovery of the membrane potential more difficult from the most negative point to resting in comparison with the control, the firing rate of the action potential increased in certain circumstances.

Most existing experimental studies and mathematic models of canopy interception have paid little attention to the interception losses of water by herbaceous plants. To better understand the canopy interception processes of herbaceous plants and to estimate the interception losses, a process-based dynamic interception model for alfalfa canopy was developed and validated by an experiment under conditions of simulated sprinkler irrigation. The parameters of the model included the maximum interception, the rate of interception of the alfalfa canopy, and the duration of sprinkler irrigation. The model demonstrated that the amount of interception increased rapidly with duration in the early stage of sprinkler irrigation, and then gradually leveled off until the maximum retention capacity of the canopy was reached. The maximum interception by the alfalfa canopy, ranging from 0.29 to 1.26 mm, increased nonlinearly with the increase of leaf area index (LAI) and sprinkling intensity. The rate of interception increased with the decrease of LAI and the increase of sprinkling intensities. Meanwhile, a nonlinear equation based on sprinkling intensity and plant height was proposed in order to more practically estimate the maximum interception by alfalfa canopy. © 2016 by the authors.","Alfalfa; Canopy interception; Leaf area index; Sprinkler irrigation; Sprinkling intensity","Estimation; Irrigation; Nonlinear equations; Plants (botany); Rain; Alfalfa; Canopy interception; Leaf Area Index; Sprinkler irrigation; Sprinkling intensity; Sprinkler systems (irrigation); alfalfa; canopy architecture; herb; interception; irrigation system; leaf area index; water retention; Medicago sativa"

Then, by taking the jitter parameter as optimization variables in the linear mathematic model and the comparability between image sequences and reference frame as optimization objective, a new estimation method for the sub-pixel jitter was proposed based on least square optimization approach. Subsequently, the solving equation was derived. Finally, the method was verified by using simulated image sequences containing the cloud scene.

In case of a faulty relationship, the ability to support the load diminishes and the onset of osteoarthritis (OA) may arise and disturb the balanced formation and resorption processes. To describe and quantify the changes occurring, 10 human OA patellae were analysed concerning the architectural parameters of the trabecular network within the first five mms by the evaluation of 3Dmicro-CT datasets. The analysed OA-samples showed a strong irregularity for all trabecular parameters across the trabecular network, no regularity in parameter distribution was found. In general, we saw a decrease of material in the OA population as BV/TV, BS/TV, Tb.N and Tb.Th were decreased and the spacing increased. The development into depth showed a logarithmic dependency, which revealed the greatest difference for all parameters within the first mm in comparison to the physiologic samples. The differences decreased towards the 5th mm. The interpretation of the mathematic dependency leads to the conclusion that the main impact of OA is beneath the subchondral bone plate (SBP) and lessens with depth. Next to the clear difference in material, the architectural arrangement is more rod-like and isotropic just beneath the SBP in comparison to the plate-like and more anisotropic physiological arrangement. © Copyright 2016 SPIE.","Micro-computed tomography; Osteoarthritic human patella; Subchondral bone; Trabecular architecture","Bone; Imaging systems; Physiology; Plates (structural components); Tomography; Anatomical structures; Architectural parameters; Architectural properties; Microcomputed tomography; Osteoarthritic human patella; Parameter distributions; Physiological loadings; Trabecular architecture; Computerized tomography"

From the relationship, we know that the divergence angle smaller as the increase of antenna obscuration ratio. It would tend to enhance the far-field energy density. But a larger obscuration ratio will increase the energy loss. At the same time, the increase of Gaussian beam apodization resulted in the energy of first diffraction ring was raised but the radius of first ring was increased. They were conflict. And then, the antenna parameters of trade-off was found from curves of obscuration ratio and curves of divergence angle. The parameters of a Cassegrain antenna was optimum designed for the energy maximization, and considerd the apodization from mechanical structure blocking. The long-distance laser communications were successful in these airborne tests. Stable communication was demonstrated. The energy gain is sufficient for SNR of high-bandwidth transmission in atmospheric channel. © 2016 SPIE.","Cassegrain; diffraction; optical antennae; space laser communication","Antennas; Big data; Data storage equipment; Diffraction; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Energy dissipation; Energy transfer; Fiber optic sensors; Gaussian beams; Gaussian distribution; Light sources; Optical communication; Optical data storage; Optical fibers; Optical instruments; Optical links; Signal to noise ratio; Atmospheric channels; Cassegrain; Central obscuration; Communication beams; Large aperture telescopes; Mechanical structures; Optical antennae; Space laser communication; Optical fiber communication"

Firstly, this research investigated the influence of grinding parameters on material removal rate and critical ductile depth, and their mathematic models based on the existing models were developed to simulate the material removal process. Then, on the basis of parameter sensitivity analysis based on partial derivative, the sensitivity models of material removal rates on grinding parameter were established and computed quantitatively by MATLAB, and the key grinding parameter for optimal grinding process was found.

Dimensional analysis enables a new point of view that demonstrated the functionality of heat loss from selected physical quantities that contribute to heat loss. The solution provides one complex criterion and four simplex criteria of similarity. Transforming these criteria of similarity leads to the formulation of the functional dependence of only two criteria, on the basis of which the amount of heat loss can be determined. The resulting criterial dependency is simple, and is calculated in this paper for a pipe one meter in longth. The mathematic model for demonstrating the heat loss is of universal validity, and applies to a wide range of piping used for hot water distribution. However, for each nominal diameter of piping it is necessary to take into account the mutual dependency of the dimensionless arguments π5 on π1, the form of which is always different.

In order to improve the grinding process and realize optimal grinding, a new controllable and flexible belt grinding mechanism is designed and assembled in a special computer numerical control grinding machine, accompanied with a constant grinding force control system. Based on the analysis of proportional valve and cylinder system in this grinding mechanism, a mathematic model of normal grinding force is constructed. Afterward, a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control strategy is proposed to deal with the uncertainty and nonlinearity of this system. A Simulink model of force control process is developed, and the good performance is achieved according to the simulation result. Finally, several grinding experiments for an aero-engine fan blade are carried out. The measurements show that the proposed grinding process with fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative force controller enhances the machining stability and efficiency considerably.

Aimed to address this problem, a new compound control strategy of displacement and dual-pressure was proposed in this study. Firstly, the mathematic model of the main components was built, and the compound control strategy was designed depending on the different working conditions. Then, the overall control system was integrated for both downstroke stage and return-stroke stage. The proposed control strategy was tested and evaluated in a 0.6 MN fast forging press. Results indicated that the input energy was reduced by 50% and energy loss decreased dramatically while control performance was good.

Content defined chunking (CDC) is the most widely used algorithm in deduplication systems. The expected chunk size is an important parameter of CDC, and it influences the duplicate elimination ratio (DER) significantly. We collected two realistic datasets to perform an experiment. The experimental results showed that the current approach of setting the expected chunk size to 4 KB or 8 KB empirically cannot optimize DER. Therefore, we present a logistic based mathematical model to reveal the hidden relationship between the expected chunk size and the DER. This model provides a theoretical basis for optimizing DER by setting the expected chunk size reasonably. We used the collected datasets to verify this model. The experimental results showed that the R2 values, which describe the goodness of fit, are above 0.9, validating the correctness of this mathematic model. Based on the DER model, we discussed how to make DER close to the optimum by setting the expected chunk size reasonably. © 2016 by the authors.","Content defined chunking; Deduplication; Duplication elimination ratio; Storage system",

The removal functions of IBF should be measured and calibrated strictly to guarantee the accuracy of the figuring results. The incident parameters of ion, surface profile and ion density distribution on the surface are the main factors which affect the material removal rate within the removal function. For the curved surfaces these factors vary from point to point so that the removal functions keeps changing when figuring curved surface especially for steep surface. Unlike the first two factors, the ion density distribution can't be described by mathematic expression directly. Moreover, the ion is not in Gaussian distribution on the curved surface any more, which will result in variation of removal functions. Faraday cup is used to get the ion space distribution. So that the ion density on an arbitrary point can be obtained exactly. Based on the material removal features, revision method is proposed to fix the difference of the removal functions between the curved surface and the flat surface. Through experiments and theoretical analysis, the removal functions changes distinctly and not in Gaussian distribution. The computation method can fit the variety of the removal function effectively. © Copyright 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Ion beam figuring; Optical design and fabrication; Removal function","Gaussian beams; Gaussian distribution; Ion beams; Optical design; Computation methods; Deterministic methods; Ion Beam Figuring; Material removal rate; Optical design and fabrication; Optical surfaces; Removal function; Space distribution; Ions"

Currently, there are not enough students who desire to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic (STEM) career fields. Additionally, female are underrepresented in STEM fields, and increased female participation may help partially address this gap. GBL was used to encourage middle school student interest in STEM by allowing them to practice computer science concepts in engaging contexts outside the classroom. The game Sorceress of Seasons was built to teach fundamental programming concepts, and was based on six requirements specifically targeted at female middle school students. The game was tested with 15 middle school-aged students. Playing the game had a positive effect on students' attitudes towards programming, with female students reporting a larger increase in computer science interest than males when compared with their previous attitudes. The results suggest that the game may be successful in increasing interest in STEM in these students. The requirements developed to guide the design of the game played a role in the game's effectiveness, and may be useful when developing an educational tool targeting female STEM interest.

Building roof points are first extracted from LiDAR data by using the reversed iterative mathematic morphological (RIMM) algorithm and the density-based method. The corresponding relations between points and rooftop patches are then established through a smoothness strategy involving ""seed point selection, patch growth, and patch smoothing."" Layer-connection points are then generated to represent a layer in the horizontal direction and to connect different layers in the vertical direction. Finally, by connecting neighboring layer-connection points, building models are constructed with the second level of detailed data. The key contributions of this approach are the use of layer-connection points and the smoothness strategy for building model reconstruction. Experimental results are analyzed from several aspects, namely, the correctness and completeness, deviation analysis of the reconstructed building roofs, and the influence of elevation to 3-D roof reconstruction. In the two experimental regions used in this paper, the completeness and correctness of the reconstructed rooftop patches were about 90% and 95%, respectively. For the deviation accuracy, the average deviation distance and standard deviation in the best case were 0.05 m and 0.18 m, respectively; and those in the worst case were 0.12 m and 0.25 m.

To meet the development trend of leveling system of hydraulic press, such as large stroke, anti-bias load ability, big leveling torque, principle of passive FLHS with four axis synchronous controlling has been proposed, using four high-precision displacement sensors and four high-response servo-proportional valves (HSPV). Because the HSPV has a certain predictive opening, during the process of passive leveling operating, linearization of the mathematic model at operating point is necessary. In this paper, a simulation model of the system, which uses the average type synchronous control strategy, is built with ADAMS and MATLAB / Simulink, as well as the operational parameters of the model. The result of the simulation shows that the system using the average type synchronous control strategy is able to ensure the synchronization error among the four axis of the leveling system.

As the voltage source converter high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) transmission system features the fast and flexible power regulation capability, supplementary damping controller (SDC) can be designed for VSC-HVDC to suppress interarea oscillation in a large-scale AC/DC power system. In this paper, an innovative adaptive dynamic programming approach, namely the goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP), is proposed to design SDC for VSC-HVDC. The GrHDP based SDC consists of three neural networks, which can automatically form an internal adaptive reward signal to facilitate better mapping between the system state and the control action. Therefore, the GrHDP based SDC can significantly improve the dynamic performance of the power system. Without knowing the exact mathematic model of the power system, the GrHDP based SDC still conducts the quick learning and universal control characteristics and has strong adaptability, which is superior to the conventional lead-lag SDC. Case study is undertaken based on a two-area four machine power system with one VSC-HVDC transmission line. The conventional lead-lag SDC has also been studied for comparison. Simulation results show that the proposed GrHDP based SDC has better performance in damping interarea oscillation than that of the conventional lead-lag SDC in a wide range of system operating conditions.","Damping control; Goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP); Interarea oscillation; VSC-HVDC","Adaptive control systems; Damping; DC power transmission; Electric power system control; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission; Energy policy; Heuristic programming; HVDC power transmission; Adaptive dynamic programming; Damping control; Damping inter-area oscillations; Heuristic dynamic programming; Inter-area oscillations; Supplementary damping controllers; Voltage source converter high voltage direct current (VSC HVDC); VSC-HVDC; Dynamic programming"

The second is at a discrete level, in which graph theory is used to create a data model with the goal of implementation in computer systems. Finally, maps are examined at an implementation level, in which the authors discuss the implementation of a fundamental map data type in database systems. The map data type presented in this book creates new mechanisms for the storage, analysis, and computation of map data objects in any field that represents data in a map form. The authors develop a model that includes a map data type capable of representing thematic and geometric attributes in a single data object. The book provides a complete example of mathematically defining a data type, ensuring closure properties of those operations, and then translating that type into a state that is suited for implementation in a particular context.

First, the magnetic tensor system is built, and the whole magnetic tensor is replaced by the expression of 5 elements. The magnetization characteristic of the hard magnetic material that comprises the carrier is analyzed, and the connatural magnetic field from carrier hard magnetic material does not vary with the change of carrier attitude and position. The mathematic model of the connatural magnetic field is constrcuted. The mechanism of the induced magnetic field from carrier soft magnetic material is analyzed, and the induced magnetic field is equivalent to the magnetic field superposition of several magnetic dipoles. The mathematic expression of the induced magnetic field is derived. The carrier magnetic tensor compensation model is established combined with the influence of the connatural magnetic field and the induced magnetic field, and the magnetic tensor compensation model with 20 coefficients is established by variable substitution and combined reduction. If we rotate the magnetic tensor system and carrier more than 4 attitudes under the equal magnetic field environment, and put the measured value of the magnetic tensor and magnetic field components into the carrier magnetic tensor compensation model, we can get the 20 magnetic tensor compensation coefficients. When the magnetic tensor system is applied to search the target, we can calculate the magnetic tensor value of the carrier with the 20 magnetic tensor compensation coefficients and the three components of the magnetic field. The magnetic tensor value of the target can be determined with the total magnetic tensor value subtracting the magnetic tensor value of carrier, and the carrier magnetic tensor compensation is realized. On the wide lawn, the magnetic tensor system is fixed on the three-axis non-magnetic turntable, a piece of iron of 0.003 m3 as the simulation carrier is put on the this turntable also with a certain distance from the magnetic tensor system. The three-axis non-magnetic turntable is rotated at different attitudes (to get more calculation accuracy, 10 attitudes are carried out), the measurement data of the magnetic tensor system are recorded. Using the magnetic tensor compensation method of this paper, the 20 magnetic tensor compensation coefficients of the simulation carrier are obtained with the measurement data. To test the validity of this compensation method, the three-axis non-magnetic turntable is rotated at another 4 attitudes, and the magnetic tensor value from the simulation carrier can be got with the 20 magnetic tensor compensation coefficients and the three components of magnetic field measured by the magnetic tensor system. The influence of the magnetic tensor of the simulation carrier is up to 653 nT/m before compensation, and the general targets can be submerged by it. After compensation, the influence is reduced to 32 nT/m, and to a certain extent, the magnetic tensor of the simulation carrier is compensated. In this paper, the carrier magnetic tensor compensation model considering the connatural magnetic field and induced magnetic field is established. The model includes 20 magnetic tensor compensation coefficients, which can be solved by the model and the measurement data. The magnetic tensor generated by the carrier can be calculated using the 20 compensation coefficients and the three components of the magnetic field, and the carrier magnetic tensor compensation is realized. It is proved that the calculated magnetic tensor is very close to the real ones of the carrier by real measuring experiment, and the compensation method in this paper can effectively accomplish carrier magnetic tensor compensation. © 2016, Science Press.

A series of factor analysis procedures was carried out experimentally with the objective to (1) assess the suitability of variables for factor analysis, (2) determine the degree of variability explained by a particular mathematic model, and (3) reveal the degree of coverage of the total number of errors by the specific variables. The results based on the example of a specific production organisation prove that the possibilities to improve the adequacy of a measurement system are significant. From the originally monitored 47 errors, 27 of the most frequent were identified, which accounts for 97% of all errors. Through factor analysis, these 27 types of errors were merged into just 11 categories of errors, with the reliability of the results maintained at 80%. The results contribute to a broader professional discussion focused on better decision-making in indicator selecting. © 2016, SRAC - Societatea Romana Pentru Asigurarea Calitatii.

Methodology: The methods are based on the fact that the productivity of a heat-and-power objects is of stochastic nature. To determine the dynamic parameters of dust emissions from a flue of mine boiler facility the solutions of mathematic problem of random process emission in a definite level were used. The concentration of dust particles in the emissions of a heat-and-power object is determined as based on the selective realization of the random process of capacity in one-month period. To determine the peculiarities of maximum surface concentrations distribution and graph dust dispersion with respect to productivity of heat-and-power objects we used the UPRZA ""EKOtsentr"" software implementing the main principles of OND-86 methods. Findings: The estimation of dynamics of productivity and dust emissions was carried out, which can be used for the monitoring of the degree of ecological danger of the emissions of heat-and-power objects of coal mining enterprises. The estimations of dust emission dynamics of heat-and-power objects allow improvement of prediction reliability for atmospheric air pollution in coal mining regions, as well as its danger level, in comparison with the estimation based on the average annual emission volumes. originality: The estimation and prediction methods of dynamic indicators of particulate matter (dust) emissions by heat-and-power objects of mines with respect to the volume of their solid fuel consumption were developed. Practical value: The obtained regularity of pollutant ventilation, emitted by heat-and-power objects of mines, enables prediction of the levels of pollution for environmental objects of the adjacent territories, as well as taking timely air protection measures. © Kolesnik V.

From the point of belt conveyor operation, the most important construction element is the conveyor belt. During the operation, the conveyor belt is influenced by many different stresses, which cause the process of damaging and wearing the belt. In order to describe the processes related to the conveyor belt wear due to material’s impact, it is necessary to analyse the impact loading process depending on the time during which the impact processes are spreading. The objective of the article is to identify the effect of selected parameters on the impact force while applying the Design of Experiment method. The result of the design of experiment shows a significant effect of the drop height, drop hammer weight, and the interaction between them on the impact force. We receipted that the drop hammer head type in the considered conditions has not significantly effect on the impact force. Using mathematic models, the relationship between the impact force local peaks and various values of the impact process input parameters (drop hammer weight and drop height) is identified. For the first impact force local peaks it has been confirmed by already existing multiple linear regression model. Other local peaks of the impact force are affected by the damped motion of an object falling onto the conveyor belt. As a result, for the other local peaks were formed the different, simpler forms of the regression models. The experimental measurements have been performed on a test rig, which was developed at the Institute of Logistics FBERG of Kosice. © 2016, Technical University of Kosice.

The main ones of the properties of criteria are simplicity, accuracy, and evaluation speed, which also enables full account of the models' properties. We explored a generalized mathematic model of UAUV. The problem on analytical determination of dependence of the estimation error in the predicted behavior of model on the properties of AUV and process parameters was formulated and solved. Based on general analytical solutions, which were obtained by the methods of finite- integral transforms, we examined the properties of such evaluations by using numerical experiments. According to results of analysis of the obtained data, it was established that a factor of the quantity of own numbers for the formation of kernels of integral transformations is more significant and it first of all determines the magnitude of error when modeling the processes. Analyticity of expressions for the estimation of error in the predicted model's behavior makes them fit for simple rapid calculations.

To assess the influence of temperature, humidity, air pollution on the mortality of Moscow inhabitants in 2007-2014, to evaluate the possibility of mortality prediction by mathematic modelling. Material and methods. For each day of 2007-2014 years, the data was analyzed for Moscow inhabitants mortality, temperature, humidity and air pollution (РМ10). Number of deaths was 956436 (48,1% of men and 51,9% women), of those from cardiovascular disorders (CVD) — 536625. Multifactorial regression analysis was done with generalized logistic regression, evaluation of risks ratios (RR), 95%, confidence analysis. The prognostic modelling applied, based on non-linear multifactorial analysis. Results. The factor “heat wave” increased RR for the death from all cases and from CVD by 1,43 and 1,65 times. Heat waves mostly increased all-cause mortality, and from CVD in women (p&lt;0,005), the increase of air pollution (РМ10) — in men (р&lt;0,005). The highest increase of death risk was found for those 70 years and older, higher humidity worsened it. For the summer 2010 prediction was finer than for 2014 (correlation 90,1% and 45,1%), e. g. for the period of more significant anomalies of temperature and air pollution. Applying multifactorial prediction model for 2007-2014 period with additional evaluation of weather factors influence for last 4 days and all-cause mortality for the last month, correlation was higher for death risk prediction for 1-3 days (88,0%), than for month (45,2%). Conclusion. Heat waves, increase of air temperature and pollution do increase the risk of all-cause mortality, especially from CVD, in those 70 y. o. and older. Anomal heat increases death risk for women higher than for men. Prediction of mortality by 1-3 days with multifactorial model show better correlation than prediction for month. © 2017, Silicea-Poligraf.

Study on the seawater aquatic life criteria for ammonia in China mainly applied the species sensitivity rank (SSR) and the mathematic models developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) in making their ammonia criteria in seawater. The total ammonia criteria were derived by a formula conversion from non-ionized ammonia criteria using toxicity data of 15 seawater species in China. When pH ranges from 7.0 to 9.0, and temperatures from 0°C to 30°C as salinity is 10, criteria maximum concentration(CMC) and criteria continuous concentration (CCC) of the total ammonia ranges from (0.089-57.141)mg/L and (0.007-4.365)mg/L, respectively;as salinity is 20, CMC and CCC ranges from (0.092-61.152) mg/L and (0.007-4.671)mg/L respectively;as salinity is 30, CMC and CCC ranges from (0.095-65.446)mg/L and (0.007-4.999)mg/L, respectively. Among these environmental factors, the greatest effect on the total ammonia criteria in seawater is pH, followed by temperatures, and then by salinity. Compared to the US ammonia criteria in seawater, the CMC range narrows 5 times and the CCC range shrinks 10 times. Results showed that the current non-ionized ammonia criteria should be corrected as a lower value of 0.007 mg/L to effectively protect the seawater species. Meanwhile, the total ammonia criteria were suggested to manage the ammonia in seawater. These provide the scientific evidence for making the ammonia standard in seawater in China. © Haiyang Xuebao.","Ammonia; Species in seawater; Species sensitivity rank (SSR); Water quality criteria; Water quality standard",

Also the question of this effect manifesting itself in other educational results was examined: further academic achievements, educational plans and trajectories. The indices of further academic achievements were school marks in algebra and Uniform State Exam results in mathematics. Educational plans were measured by three questions: about aspirations to go to college, estimated probability of choice of STEM profession and estimated points in Uniform State Exam in mathematics. For educational trajectories two indicators were used: continuation of study in general school after the 9th grade and study in a class with enhanced education in math or physics. The results of multilevel regression analysis show that the negative effect of average marks in a class (controlling for the results of TIMSS in math) is important for self-esteem in math, further school marks on algebra and aspirations to go to college.

At the same time, many kinds of carbon fiber material have been used in different area, such as sports products, transportation, microelectronic industry and so on. Moreover, there is lack of the combination research on the laser interaction with Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) material with simulation method. In this paper, the temperature status of long pulse laser interaction with CFRP will be simulated and discussed. Firstly, a laser thermal damage model has been built considering the heat conduction theory and thermal-elasto-plastic theory. Then using COMSOL Multiphysics software to build the geometric model and to simulate the mathematic results. Secondly, the functions of long pulse laser interaction with CFRP has been introduced. Material surface temperature increased by time during the laser irradiating time and the increasing speed is faster when the laser fluence is higher. Furthermore, the peak temperature of the center of material surface is increasing by enhanced the laser fluence when the pulse length is a constant value. In this condition, both the ablation depth and the Heat Affected Zone(HAZ) is larger when increased laser fluence. When keep the laser fluence as a constant value, the laser with shorter pulse length is more easier to make the CFRP to the vaporization material. Meanwhile, the HAZ is becoming larger when the pulse length is longer, and the thermal effect depth is as the same trend as the HAZ. As a result, when long pulse laser interaction with CFRP material, the thermal effect is the significant value to analysis the process, which is mostly effect by laser fluence and pulse length.

Methodology. The methodology is based on the stochastic nature of mine capacity. That is why we suggested determining the dynamic parameters for dust emission from coal mine fang according to the random process of mine capacity in a one-month period. The common solutions of mathematic the problem of the overshoot of the random process above a set level were applied. Findings: It was stated that the volumes of dust emission from a fang are proportional to one-hour capacity of skip hoisting. The probabilistic assessment of capacity dynamics and dust emission was carried out; it can be applied for the prediction of ecological danger level of dust emission from a coal mine fang. As a result of integration of problem of the overshoot of the random process above a set level, the following average values were determined: the time of the definite level exceeding in a definite period; number of cases of the definite level overriding; the duration of the process overriding the normalized level. The probabilistic assessment of dust emission dynamics from coal mine fang enables confidence increase for the prediction of pollution level of atmospheric air and its danger rate compared with the existing assessment of annual average emission volumes. Originality: The methodology of dynamic parameters assessment for solid particles (dust) emission from coal mine fang was prepared as based on the data of mine capacity changes in one-month period. Practical value: The obtained regularities of dust emission formation of coal mine allow the prediction of the level of environmental objects pollution in the adjacent territories and to take timely measures for protection of the environment. © Kolesnik V.

However, such coordinated equilibrium point is comparatively hard to achieve unless one TSO control center could obtain all grids' information in detail, which may lead to confidential issue and heavy communicating load. The purpose of this paper is to propose a solution to optimizing the reactive power control efforts among multi-TSOs grids with a mathematic interconnection model and reasonable communication cost. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the interconnected power network equation, the stability-related optimum reactive power injection and the power-loss-related optimum reactive power injection were derived, respectively. Furthermore, according to the decomposition-And-coordinationbased computing methodology, a coordinated RPO model for interconnected TSOs was designed, taking into consideration both the static voltage stability and economy. Findings - The extreme values for the indicator L of power grid voltage stability and active power loss function were found and proved to be minimums. According to these extreme values, an expression for the reactive power injection at interconnected nodes between TSOs grids was obtained, and a coordinated strategy of RPO was established, which could take the static voltage stability and economy into consideration without confidential concern. Originality/value - The existence of minimum values for indicator L of voltage stability and power loss was demonstrated, respectively. And the method presented in this paper can ensure the safety of information among different TSO grids, i.e. avoiding confidential issues. In particular, the coordinated control method can be implemented on the local power grid without knowing all of the parameters of its interconnection. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Coordinated control; Indicator L; Multi-TSOs grids; RPO","Electric power system economics; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power system stability; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Power control; Reactive power; Stability; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Co-ordinated control; Design/methodology/approach; Interconnected power network; Interconnection modeling; Multi-TSOs grids; Reactive power injections; Reactive power optimization; Static voltage stability; Electric power system control"

The acquiring of this skill is only possible with the approaches that the teachers used in the process. At this point, the problem to be researched in terms of making proofs is seen in how middle school students prove a mathematical expression; what kinds of reasoning and proof types they use in this process; how the teachers of these students prove the same expression; and how they reflect it to their instruction. Purpose of the Study: The purpose of this study is to investigate the middle school students’ and their teachers’ reasoning types and proof methods while proving a mathematical expression. Method: A basic qualitative research design was conducted to investigate the research problems. Participants in this study were two middle school mathematics teachers who have different professional experiences, and 18 students from 6th, 7th and 8th grades. A clinical interview technique was used to collect data and the interviews were video recorded. A thematic analysis method was used to analyze the data. Findings and Results: The middle school students tried to decide on the argument by following specific cases in order to verify a mathematical expression, and in this context they performed several actions, such as pattern recognition, seeking the relationship between two variables, and making conjectures. They have performed three types of actions, namely verification, explanation and abstraction during the proving of a mathematical expression. Moreover, they have provided some arguments which were not accepted as proof, by offering experimental, intuitive or illogical justification. On the other hand, it has been observed that the middle school mathematic teachers thought in the same way that their students thought while proving a given mathematical expression. Discussion, Conclusion and Recommendations: As a result of this study, it has been found that students had difficulties in proving mathematical statements; they preferred to use experimental proofs and mostly adapted an inductive approach. On the other hand, the proving tendency of the teachers was mostly at a verification and explanation level; they have a similar structure of thinking with their students in the process of proving mathematical expressions. Reasoning and proof should be the fundamental aspects of mathematics teaching, should play a significant role in mathematical contents without taking it independently, and should be developed in the earlier years. In addition, to what extent mathematics textbooks and mathematics curriculum in each grade level support the reasoning and proof standards should be investigated. © 2016, Ani Publishing.

Aim. To invent a mathematic model and algorithm of individualized risk assessment for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in dilation cardiomyopathy patients (DCMP). Material and methods. Totally, 165 patients included, with verified DCMP (mean age 49,2±11,5 y; 135/81,8% males; NYHA class 2,67±0,45; LV ejection fraction 26,7±10,1%; follow-up 46,7±12,5 months). With an original software “Intecard 7”, with the data of 7-minute ECG-12 registration, we evaluated markers of electrical instability of myocardium — microvoltage alternans of T-waves (mATW), turbulence of cardiac rhythm (TCR), intervals QT and JT dispersion, acceleration and deceleration of cardiac rhythm. As primary endpoints for multifactorial Cox-analysis we used sustained ventricular tachicardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation, shocks of implanted devices and documented SCD. We analyzed clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic data and results of molecular-genetic study of lamin A/C gene (LMNA). Results. As result of multifactor regression analysis we found 2 cumulative independent predictors (HR 5,23; 95% CI 1,45-16,9; р=0,013) of life-threatening VTA events in DCMP patients: paroxysms of non-sustained VT (≥5 ventricular complexes with HR ≥150 bpm) and changes in LMNA gene (missense mutations and polymorhpism of 10 exon of rs4641). With binary logit-regression analysis of independent risk factors (VES, sVT, mATW, TCR, JTd and GLS LV) we built-up a model of binary regression (F=31,2; χ2=143,2; p=0,0000) and developed an algorithm of SCD risk evaluation that make it to classify with high prediction power up to 93,9%, cases of DCMP (OR 470; sensitivity 80,8%, specificity 99,1%). Conclusion. The invented algorithm of SCD risk is non-ivasive, individualized, easily applicable and interpretable technology that makes it to stratify patients with higher risk of life-threatening VTA with standard clinical and instrumental methods of investigation (ECG, EchoCG, Holter ECG).

Aim: To study the plasma concentration and interrelation of inflammation biomarkers of C-reactive protein, tumor-necrosis factor- α (TNF-α) and leptin level in patients with ischemic heart disease of different nature of flow and to define their diagnostic value as of indicators for destabilizing the atherosclerotic process. Patients and methods: 86 male patients with ischemic heart disease of the average age of 56.2±5.1 have been examined. 29 patients showed stable ischemic heart disease of functional class II, 31 patients - ischemic heart disease of functional class III, while 26 patients were diagnosed with unstable ischemic heart disease. The control group included 26 practically healthy men of matching age who volunteered to participate. All the patients were examined according to the Guidelines of the European Society of Cardiologists (ESC, 2013). The plasma concentrations of highly sensitive C-reactive protein, TNF-α and leptin were determined by immune-enzyme methods. The statistical analysis was made with the help of software kits Microsoft Excel, Statistics for Windows 6.0. Results: The patients with ischemic heart disease the levels of the studied indices tended to grow and were higher in comparison with reference values, the most visible changes being detected in patients with unstable angina. The destabilized process showed the valid increase of the levels of highly sensitive C-reactive protein and TNF-α in 92.3% and 100% patients, leptin level - in 84.6 % patients correspondingly. The critical limit values allowing to suggest the activation of latent inflammation irrespective of presence or absence of clinical symptoms were identified. To them refer the levels of plasmatic highly sensitive C-reactive protein - 2.57 mg/ml, TNF-α - 2.44 pg/ml, leptin - 18.44 ng/mL. The information value and capability of destabilization model of ischemic heart disease significantly rose at simultaneous use of such two markers of non-specific inflammation as C-reactive protein and tumor- -necrotic factor-α. Adding leptin to the mathematic model did not show any significant impact on its information capacity. Conclusions: Identifying combinations of levels of highly sensitive C-reactive protein > 2.97 mg/l and TNF-α > 2.44 pg/ml possesses maximal prognostic capacity with regard to atherosclerosis destabilization and development of cardiovascular complications in patients with stable ischemic heart disease.","Atherosclerosis; C-reactive protein; Ischemic heart disease; Leptin; Tumor-necrotic factor-α",

In this study, canopy interception process was investigated using the small watershed comprehensive experimental technology at the third watershed (No. III) in Huitong National Key Forest Ecosystem Research Station, Hunan. Forest rainfall, throughfall, and stemflow were monitored and the rate of rainfall interception was estimated in young, mid-age, and early-mature stands of Chinese fir plantations from 1983 to 2007 The mathematic Fan model was used to estimate the rainfall interception process. The results showed that (1) the average rainfall interception rates were 26.0% in young stands, 27.9% in mid-age stands, and 29.5% in early-mature stands; the seasonal variation of interception rates was similar in the three stages of Chinese fir plantations, but the interception rates were significantly higher in early-mature stands than young stands, especially within the months when rainfall amount was small. (2) When a rainfall event was amounted to less than 1.0 mm, there was no significant difference in rainfall interception rates for all three stands, which were all over 86%; when the amount of a rainfall event was 1.0—2.0 mm, interception rates considerably declined in the three growth stands. The interception rate was 48.1% in the young stands, 48.7% in the mid-age stands, and 47.1% in the early-mature stands and no significant differences were found in terms of interception rates among the three stands; when a rainfall event reached 2.0—4.0 mm, the interception rates significantly differed in the three stands, with the values of 30.5% in the young stand, 38.4% in the mid-age stand, and 44.1% in the early-mature stand; when a rainfall amount was greater than 100 mm, the interception rates were not significantly different between the three stands with less than 10% of interception rates.

But consumers’ demand changes owing to rapid growth of market economy. The focus of the product transforms from original basic demand to deeper level of Kansei. Consumers’ Kansei appeal should be reflected more and presented by shape, material, color or other shaping element of smart watch besides considering health, comfort and other elements because the relation of watch and human are relatively intimated. Old people are different from general consumer group physically and psychologically, which embodies in the degeneration of visual sense, auditory sense, reaction capacity, the force of hands and the memory ability of text and graphic. Old people are greatly different from other group in Kansei intention and user experience of using smart watch. Therefore whether appearance design or interaction design for watch should embody our care for the special group-old people to improve the product satisfaction degree and bring convenience for them.

The main results and completed work in this paper includes: Survey on shaping, interview and questionnaire appraisal of smart watch targeting at old people consumer group are carried out firstly; relative data information and picture sample pool are collected; shaping of smart watch for old people is broken down using Morphological Analysis method and survey contents to determine shaping design elements which influence image of consumers; representative image words describing the shaping of smart watch for old people are determined with cluster analysis method; and then multivariate linear relation model between consumers’ Kansei intention and the shaping design of smart watch for old people is built. Quantification relation between Kansei image meaning evaluation value and shaping design elements are built and multivariate regression analysis is conducted with Quantification Theory Type Imethod on the basis of performing statistical analysis on image meaning evaluation experiment result of representative sample to obtain correlated category score, item range, constant, multiple correlation coefficient and determination coefficient. And on this basis mathematic relation model between all Kansei intention and design elements are built so that the aim of estimating consumers’ Kansei intention is reached. Finally sample is selected to verify it, Paired-sample T check analysis on the estimation value of correlation model and the mean value of subjective evaluation is conducted and the result shows that the estimation model has reliability. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Kansei engineering; Quantification theory type I; Smart watch","Cluster analysis; Design; Economics; Estimation; Human computer interaction; Image analysis; Multivariant analysis; Regression analysis; Reliability analysis; Surveys; User interfaces; Watches; Wearable computers; Cluster analysis methods; Determination coefficients; Evaluation experiments; Kansei Engineering; Multiple correlation coefficients; Multivariate regression analysis; Quantification theory type i; Subjective evaluations; Product design"
